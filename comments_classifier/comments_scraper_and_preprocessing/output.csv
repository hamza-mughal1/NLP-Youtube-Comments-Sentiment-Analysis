"This was so good actually personally, the songs as well my god"
gene was better
There is a lot of politics in this movie . But there is a nice message in it .
"Black people: 13% of US population.
Also black people: 50% of every modern movie including ones about Victorian England. Lmao. Laughable."
Willy Wonka and the little chocalate girl.

"I watched it last night and I cried 3 times on the movie, The acting is really good and heartfelt 😢❤ solid 100/10 🎉❤"
"Wonka é um dos melhores filmes de 2023, uma grande surpresa. Um filme lindo, emocionante e muito cativante, seja pelos cenários, figurinos e atores;  Timothée Chalamet está incrível, ele consegue transpor muito bem toda a essência do Willy, um jovem chocolateiro, ingênuo e sonhador que busca ter espaço no monopólio do chocolate. E é lindo ver toda essa jornada dele, eu amei esse filme. ❤"
"They figured out how to give a black woman a starring role in even this story.  And she taught the guy how to read no less!   Thank you sub Saharan Africa, for Willie........ 😵‍💫"
That guy(willy Wonka) is from little princess movie also
The movie was better than i thought it would be ngl
The lisan alikiba as wonka dont work
In this movie i was get confused because in first movie Willie say he first time eat chocolate was with his father and he living with them when he was child but here in new movie is that he is with mom and she give him first chocolate taste so i little bit confused there ? I am alone with that or not
Ngl this movie was a massive disappointment
What a load a boring crapola. As usual. Been there done that.
Yeah KATYA was right.... This is Alyssa Edwards
Um lixo
"A child playing Willy Wonka is stupid. I’m not looking forward to seeing this, but feel I have to to give it a chance. Love live Gene Wilder - the real Willy Wonka."
WOKA
I don't know what to make of this...
Ompalommpa doopadu doo I got a bad feeling about you
I hope you change the name of the movie since it is not related to charlie and the chocolate factory. The back story of wonka in the charlie of the chocolate factory is different to this story. The movie is good but if you expect that it is the back story of wonka it is not!!

Don't want to spoil but the ending was edited very weak. I could of cried really hard but they pus'd out. Crying is kind of a guilty pleasure so what a let down
.
"So instead of creating something original, they remake a remake. ""I have an idea! Let's do a remake."""
wonka what country is that
oh
Can we just have something new...
Its a diverse cast for sure
Who up Wonking they Willy
"Uuuuum, where is Charlie 😢"
Don't know a single person who has watched this.
They’ll probably start making the real wonka bars again after this movie😊
All the big movies are movies I have already seen. I think Hollywood & Disney are not capable of originality. Popular culture has become boring over this past generation.
Meh
My favorite part is when Wonka added a little too much spice and started dreaming about leading a group of desert folks to paradise 👍
Um i think i saw the woman from Paddington bear ...
I like my chocolate absolutely insane. 😂 This movie is just what the chocolatier order
"Half-way through the trailer I said , ""ok this has to be a must watch asap..😊😊"
Wonka Kay Jhonny deep
Anyone who wants to watch this is brain dead
The songs aren't very good at all. They aren't magical and they are way overproduced sounding. The movie itself and the story are wonderful but the songs ruin it for me.
I just made an original song called “WONK” give it a listen if you like the franchise 🤍
The Spice must flow
ohh 😊
this nostalgia show returned to my brain...Mad Respect
Willy Woke-a lol Hollywood just cannot help themselves anymore. SMH
What a garbage movie this was xD
"I like the movie but I expected more for a storyline,the storyline was really weak😢"
What a stupid movie
"No matter how many times you remake or revisit this, None will be better than the one with Gene Wilder"
Çok güzel beğendim arayüzü çok iyi
Ooooooo🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
Enfes bir film çok zevk aldım izlerken 🎉
film çok iyi çok güzel Aksiyonlu❤❤❤
"It is the metaphoric version of a drug dealer (Will Wonka --> Walter White --> notice the WW name resemblence), trying to beat all the other drug cartels in the town and own the whole marketplace with his amazingly purified crystal meth ---> chocolate candies. You don't believe me? Well, just think about it 😉 wink wink"
who tf hired mark rober
Can we see a little creativity in the film industry? Maybe not a remake of a film that was perfect
Muhtesem
The best
It is obvious that the actors filmed in this film masterfully play their part

"Amazing movie, makas everyone want to eat choclate"
Harikadan daha fazlası bir film
"Imagine absolutely nobody asking for a remake and then bam, it comes out! Make a new movie you absolute dead brained pathetic childish writers, I can get absolutely plastered and propose “WiLlY wOnKa ReMaKe” take your parents money and use it else where if you want to rinse and repeat another movie and make a “creative” twist that literally isn’t anything"
No day dreaming????
Norman Osbourne: “You know I’m something of an inventor Myself”
"They kept the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa til last. I'm Sold.
❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️👍"
5 min in and the cringe was too much. Couldn't do it.
"why can't these writers stop stealing other peoples originals? why can't they be imaginative and think for themselves and do their own work? all their doing is getting credit by being a copy cat, that ain't being successful. People already seen the story we don't need to see it 30282992 more ways! leave the classics alone and create your own!"
May thy chocolate chip and shatter
"I watched this, today. I think it is a very good Movie, made in a classic tradition. I encourage true Movie Fans to watch it.  I found it very enjoyable."
"WONKA - This was GREAT!!!  The lead actor (Timothy) has charisma, makes the movie great!  Love him!! Great casting!!! Great storyline!!WONKA is great!!Worth seeing..I just watched it 03/17/2024!!!!!!!"
Wonka have chocolate like kit kat
I love wanka😊😊👌👌👍💜💜
I love it when the trailer is better than the movie itself🥰✌️
"DEI in every scene.  Nothing looks natural.   Forced mind control from the woke left.
What an awful movie.   Amazing how every scene in every movie these days  looks like a NYC Subway at morning rush hour.   
Such embarrassing nonsense hollywood keeps putting out.  Woke woke woke woke woke poison."
When I first saw the trailer I thought he wasn’t the right actor but then I saw the movie he was amazing
"This was awesome and the music was fantastic! My kids and I enjoyed it so much. I would love to finally see a family-friendly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (not a dark creepy one 🫤) with Timothée and the same light-hearted, hilarious, magical fun from this movie."
Show me a video where the man is wearing his mask in public while he is wearing his glasses
The opening musical score in the movie brought back such a fond memory of Gene Wilder that I never thought existed in my mind.
And that’s how we got the meme..
"the movie is highly overrated, it is 50% musical, with great graphics but scenes being poorly directed. The best part of the movie is the Oompa Loompas song."
Timmy ATE
Kong has the best look ever and Scar king is epic.❤❤
"I’m 35 and I get excited for movies very rarely. I went into this with very low expectations. I still have deep-seated trauma from seeing the last remake of this movie. But this… Delivered on all fronts. Original story, adorable and memorable characters, and probably most importantly, for a musical: new songs that are actually good songs. And this is coming from a guy who would probably rather watch “predator“ for the 200th time, rather than a musical reboot, ew, gross.  My childhood has been robbed from me enough, thank you very much, Disney. This is a solid movie. I actually think Timothée Chalamet can be a little bit one dimensional at times, but I respect him for this, because he took a risk. I mean, he’s not actually a very good singer and it’s obvious (before anyone gets mad, no, I’m no better of a singer ). But that’s what I appreciate about him: he read a great screenplay, and he put his heart and soul into this role.  This whimsical, silly roll for a serious actor is such a risk, and he took it. And in doing, so, totally proved the doubters and haters wrong. I’m not a hater I don’t have the energy for that, but I was a doubter. “This again? With this guy? Yeah, good luck I bet this is garbage”. I love being proven wrong. This is a solid movie."
as good as the movie is...its not good enough without jhonny depp. may be its just me but the new guy...isnt jhonny. and without jhonny its not wonka.
I see thousands of fanatical legions of Oompa Loompas making chocolate in my father's name!
Its my favorite movie i❤ it
Needs more johny dep
1:50 she from paddington???
Definitely prefer This movie over Charlie chocolate factory. Now we just need to see a movie about the factory spies.
Timthee is a great actor
ima have to stick wit Johnny depp sorry :/
This film was amazing!
"Ngl, the only reason I gave this a go was because Paul King directed it, and after Paddington 1 and 2, I'd trust him with my life. This was such a sweet delight, and I'm glad I didn't go into it cynically. It was just a heartwarming romp. <3"
"I just watched this movie with my partner and his parents tonight, it was amazing, I was told it was good and I love it. With a hit movie like Wonka, its going to head to Broadway 🍫💛🎶"
Timothée Chalamet as Wonka is the most graceful thing to exist ❤
"I’m a 30 year old metal head… musicals have never been my thing. There’s a few I find entertaining enough to sit through….. FORRRR A MOMENTTTTT LIFE DOESNT SEEM QUITE SOOOO BADDDDD!!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾 and let’s not get me started on WELLL THERES CHOCOLATE!! AND THERES CHOCOLATE. (Side note his moms chocolate bar hit home for me, my mother wasn’t really present during my childhood. Not because she was a bad parent, just… circumstances. I have a “wonka bar” she gave me as a kid.) and now since I’ve bored you with a cliche lemme just SCRUBBB SCRUBBB this comment ❤❤❤"
Bad movie
What’s with all the black people?
Woka
I need to watch a movie now I have to watch a movie Dance Moms
Watching this solidified my desire to commit suicide in the chocolate river.
"It was ok, def nothing special."
Rowan Atkinson the best ❤
This movie was awful. Woke Garbage
In our English book there is a chapter the invention of vita-wonk from charlie and the great glass elevator
I saw Rowan Atkinson here😂. This movie must be very good
Its soooo fun to watch! Absolutely loved it
What's going on!!! This movie is a fukin musical.  The original was better as always.  It's like people are getting more n more fruity af. Trash movie
"Im extremly dissapointed. I had so much excitement for this and to say the least, its boring. Im half way throigh and im forcing myseld to finish lol."
Andrew Garfield best male actress.wish see him in this movie
This looks absolutely shizer

R.i.p Gene Wilder #WillyWonkaAlways
This movie made me miss Gene Wilder even more. This was bad!
Such a disappointment
Watched about 15 minutes of this movie and it's a total joke just another movie remake that they destroyed horrible what they do to old classics what a shame
Surprised they didn't make him black like all the other characters they're race swapping these days.
"This was (apart from Oppenheimer) the most boring film i have ever seen. I fell asleep and thanked god i woke up at the end. My niece loudly said ""mummy can i play on your phone"" halfway through and the whole theatre laughed to bits as we all felt the same."
"Lame , stupid movie that has no connection to the original. 
Inclusion is a great thing but seriously this is an assault on the mind."
"It's magical. I've watched it about twelve times, I just love it"
Loved it ❤ ❤
"movie was trash af, dont recommend anybody watch it"
"I was lowkey hating on this movie at first, as I really love the other films. However, I just watched it on HBO Max and I looooved it. Timothee did a great job"
"It’s an ok movie on its own but don’t attach Willy Wonka to it. I think the only way to do Willy Wonka is to remake it, same thing but with different actors, shot differently, more of a real feel to it maybe. I think most people like the original it because it’s nostalgic."
I am pretty sure he put LSD to his chocolate after watching movie
Muad’Dib really seems to have turned a new leaf
I all forgot one think that I did not say when wonka shows the video of him when he was a kid when he tried chocolate from his mother
In 2025 January the 2nd
I Hope you make a new Wonko movie called Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory  where it has all the same people from the Wonka people and the same Willy Wonka from the Wonka movie the same kids from the Wonka and the chocolate factory but this time it's different it's like after the Wonka movie where it's like the wonko movie mixed with the Wonka and the chocolate factory were The grandfather the child and Wonka went in the flying elevator were the kid see the town that he lives in and the ending has him when wonka showed his mother but only the picture and  show the people who lost in the chocolate factory and the child gets the giant chocolate and shows his old chocolate factory where it was burnt
I really enjoyed this movie!!!!! It's worth a look see
I love the movie ❤❤
This movie really sucks
Please make another wonka we need it cuz this was a masterpiece please🥺😁
Love this movie and that they used the old songs!❤
Why am I just now finding out about this? What rock have I been under?😍
Wow I truly enjoyed every thing about this beautiful master piece the music the actors absolutely a phenomenal movie for the whole family ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"interesting  story  idea  great  music
a bit odd  but I enjoyed the chosen actors..
much better  than previous  version"
"Gaslighting musical goofy movie, yes the original was a musical but actually had good story that made the songs almost an after thought"
"Just watched downtown Abbey, so weird seeing mister Carson like this 😂😂😂"
Paul atreides after resigning as an emperror
is this guy Charlie in WIlly Wonka? OMG IS COOL
I watched thus movie today in the cinema. Just fabulous 💯❤
Boring woke drivel.
"This was an excellent theatrical production. I mean that literally. It wasn't cinematic. It was a theatrical musical. Between story, song, and dance; it was charming, poignant, and cute. I dare to say it will be a classic. I remember hearing it bombed at the box office. No matter. It might take 5 years streaming. It will be so."
They checked a couple boxes. Not for me. Sucks bc it looks cool
3rd best movie from timothee chamelon
None of the Wonka films have been good at all 😢. Why do you guys always make it so bad?! 🫤
Is this geared towards adults?
i love this movie but no one is beating Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka
He is not Willy! He is grown up Charlie ❤
Flacid really. At times it perks up but overall a snoozefest that won't be revisited
Watch out for the chocolate sandworms
Worst bit of Woke garbage I have ever  paid 5 minutes to. Disney just sucks anymore
American accent is so wrong for this 🤦‍♀️
They should have casted Megan thee stallion instead of that girl
who wonkin they willy rn
"This movie does not star Timothee Chalamet. It stars Timothy Motherfuking Chalamet. That's the first reason I want to see this. Two anytime the little guy sticks it to the big man is a win in my book, even if it's a prequel of a remake of an adaptation of a book. And number three I really want to know how this man turns into a child kidnapper. Plus Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is something I didn't know I needed in my life"
"would have been a decent film if... ye old England weren't made black and ""woke"""
Abysmal acting as usual from Timothy.
"Universal/Illumination/Aardman/Ambiln Entertainment/Jim Henson Productions/Dreamworks(The Santa,s Claruz) (Variant)"
0:34 me after i get my willy wonked
is gud do
Omg I’m going tomorrow to watch it with my year group! Soooo awesome!!!!!😊
"I really enjoyed this movie, didn't expect it to be good, but it was!"
Willy Woka
That's probably the movie role that dwarf actors lost.
Garbage.
best movie ever! it was so magical and entertaining. Chalamet is truly the actor of our century!
Really No Day Dreaming? That is a DUMB law! smh! 🙄🙄
0:51 do u hate this movie
Why is there a black person playing the white person again
Güzel
A black female character wasn't ever the part of the original Roald Dahl classic novel. -_- BS

Şahane sahneleri var
"I wish you to watch it in musical fantasy movie series.  How does it feel sometimes to be far away from the beautiful places, cities and cities where cinema is the subject?  Musical fantasy is also a therapy.  Enjoy watching."
Very nice 😊
😮
Çok güzel film kesşnlikle izlemelisiniz
"A beautiful production, impressive, full of magic, excitement, success, thank you, we are waiting for the sequel.❤"
Mutlaka izlenmesi gereken bir film harikaa
It can be one of the most amazing movies I have seen
Bu diziye bayıldım çok güzel bir dizi
İçerik olarak baya sürükleyici süper ötesi bir yapıt kesinlikle tavsiye ediyorum 🎉
Harika film başarılı
"Wonka filminin başarılı bir yapım olacağını düşünüyorum. Timothée Chalamet'in başrolde olması ve Wonka'nın geçmişine odaklanması ilginç bir yaklaşım sunabilir. Ancak, filmi izlemeden kesin bir yargıya varmak zor."
Süper bir film olmuş fevkulade  izleme nizi tavsiye ederim
Hugh grant being cast as the oompa loompas is not something  we wanted but something we needed..
Çok güzel bir filim

Süper ya
Es un musical mas que nada
"Seems fun, seems like a movie with an old soul. And I don’t just say that because of the setting. I mean, it seems like the movie just wants me to enjoy the movie."
I’m sitting in the theatre right now all by myself getting ready to watch it. Hopefully it will be good.
Took my son to see this and thought I was gonna fall asleep......nope. I enjoyed it more than he did probably lol! 🔥🔥🔥
"I don’t understand why we needed this movie, we already had two before it. Sure one was in the 80s and showing its age but the other was as Modern as it could get and wasn’t showing its age in the slightest, so I guess we have three Charlie and the chocolate factory movies and still ZERO glass elevator movies (sequel), why has god forsaken us?"
Now this made me happy and cry at the sametime! Joy!! 😂😂😂 i can't wait to see this movie! 🍬🍭🍫
"I watched this flim, and it's azming! But what I'd love most about the ompa loompa is the very time he met. He reminded him he is always in debt"
The film industry's woke virtue signaling is ruining everything. And why the f**k choose a little boy to play wonker. total bs
This is what would happen if paul straight up snorted the spice
i  reley  want  to  watch  it.
Wrong casting
This movie looks so catgacating
WHAT IS THAT? IT'S (NOT) THE UNKNOWN
I want to watch Wonka but my brother brought me to watch a different movie just now but the guy in the movie looks like Wonka
Why do a lot of movies have this vibe of cringe
I give it 5 bags of popcorn
Need a refund because I only came to watch The Unknown
No other race whine about their race not being on the film..save for the blacks for some reason. This movie forcefully replaced the main characters to amature black actors. Just not a movie for me.. I don't like movies that race swap for no good reason.
Sat through the whole thing waiting for the scene with The Unknown.....he isn't even in it
garbage shite.
Didn’t have The Unknown. 0/10.
Still better than Glasgow
Willy before Wonka
"My favorite scene in this movie is when Willy fights ""The Unknown"" and sucks him into a vacuum."
"You would never know it by the trailer but THE NEWEST WONKA MOVIE IS MOSTLY A MUSICAL. If you don't like a lot of singing in a movie, you'll probably not appreciate this movie."
Musicals movie ❤
Books by Roald Dahl ❤
Edward scissor hands❤fame
Hugh ❤grant❤
"comment movie,
🛥️ blast boat, a lay down ... 🤞 😅"
I want a factory that produces spice
"This story is before Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The film is based on a novel, ‘Charlie and the Chocolate Factory’. The movie tells the story about Charlie's childhood, so we can know why Charlie is obsessed with chocolate.
I love the acting, music, and graphic in this film. Timothee Chalamet plays the role of Willy Wonka. My favorite character is Willy Wonka because he is very bright and creative. In addition, music and graphic in this movie was so amazing. I was moved with songs and graphic was definitely beautiful.
I think this is a great film for people who like fantasy movie and Timothee Chalamet. It makes Timothee Chalamet more charming. The story is a little bit sad, but positive and exciting.
I’ll give Wonka ‘five stars’. I want to watch one more!"
"How did Willy Wonka's eyes end up turning blue and his hair going blonde??? Maybe he'll look more like Gene Wilder in part 2, 3, 4 or 5. 💩"
Wonka meme
Love the new wonky film !
"I like Timothée but he ain't no Johnny Depp... Johnny gave a perfect unsettling creepy vibe to Wonka that Tim is missing. also Johnny's character was actually faithful to the book this new movie completely missed the point and vibe of the book, or any of the messages and lessons of it. this isnt suppose to be some colourful happy go lucky fantasy fairytale"
😇❤️❤️

Rowan Atkinson
"0:25 is this the ""GROS HORLOGE"" of Rouen?"
"Aardman + Ambiln Entertainment + Jim Henson + Dreamworks + Illumination:The Santa,s Claruz (2048) Official Trailer 2"
Holy cow does that movie look good!!
Nice Trailer
"Entertaining to say the least but not worth the hype - good enough to pass sometime, lots of continuity with the original movie but are we not somewhat cheated over the stage set designed in front of us to say this is the movie you don't get to see - the factory, why it closed down and then one day why smoke started coming out of it's chimneys' and it reopened with great mystery? 

Why we stick to a stage set that reminds me of the Harry Potter sweet shop with puking pastels alongside a magical luggage case that expands into a mini chocolate factory is why Fantastic Beasts also gets a reminder alongside start up businesses with the cake shop. 

The film seems to get stuck between the hotel location and shop to a point that as a musical (based on the umpa lumpa's being musical people) it's more in line with a west end staged production, good if your a huge fan of that sort of thing. Then there's the over use of HD optics that take away the flicker of the big screen and magic of moving pictures. It's all rather too clinical to feel like a movie. IMO. and you?"
so where did the green midgets come from?
"If it ain't Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder, I don't want it..."
this movie is so fun
"Awful, please do yourself a favor and don't watch this cringe fest"
"this sucked brutally! thanks again for ruining  another child's beloved fave - but then again, anymore I go in expecting it to be bad and ruined so as to not be let down and shocked if it's any good"
Beyond stupid. The worst movie ever. Its pathetic
We watched it today ❤❤❤❤❤ I loved it! And my kids 5-8 years old loved it so much ❤❤❤
"It's been a while since I watched what I consider a child's movie, What I can say is good actors great scenes and actually enjoyable Production  and the little black actress is very talented ❤🎉❤ I guess I'll think about it twice when I see childrens movies😂."
"Wow i've never seen this many positive reviews I thought this movie will never be as good as Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka but I guess we'll have to find out shall we, there are alot of amazing actors though so I won't doubt the movie quality, acting, and the CGI"
That actor is very overrated. He def cant play Wonka
This one is good to be honest even the best. as both wonka movies
"Talopaska
Kaisopomase"
"When I think of whimsical, this actor is the last person I think of. Terrible actor for Dune as well."
"Disappointing DEI horrible rendition of the original.  Bring back the original with Gene Wilder.  Willy Wonka was NOT a magician performing a magical fantasy.  The original used real mechanical genius in his chocolate factory with oompa loompa workmen.  The dog was fake most of the time.  Story pushes the woke narrative to hate white men, with one of the bad guys looking like a pale white Hitler.  The white laundry couple with indentured slaves are the evil ones.  Cops are corrupt, and all the forced races everywhere is obvious; where's the white kid who wins the Golden ticket?  And the Church and Christians are sinners.

This is why I search back decades to watch movies and TV I've missed that were written without ruining it by the cultural wars of today.  All movies, TV series, streaming and entertainment is trash now due to this wokeness disease and why they have massive losses and layoffs we see today.  Disney even admitted it this year in their earnings report.  Skip this wokism and watch the original Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder (1971)."
So Willy Wonka was a sane person from the start...ehm
It was a pretty darn good movie
dont be a hero but u r hero wb.🎉❤❤
"Just came back from Vue Cinema and I went there to see Wonka and OMG it was the best movie I have ever seen, PLS MAKE A DVD! 📀🍫"
movie looks like it sucks
Honestly this is a good movie even when others seem to dislike it. It’s cute and it explains the way he is in the original and why he acts the way he does towards Charlie
Soooooooooo good. Put your hand into your Pockolate (get yourself some lovely Chocolate)
"Every one after wonka came out: its so   magical and great.

Every one before: oompa loompa doopity doo, i got a baaaaaaaad feeling of you."
"""Every good thing in this world started with a dream, so you hold on to yours."" This really touched me."
Ppl who saw mrbean
"What a Wonkar! Excellent acting and performances but the story was plain boring!
🎭🤗💤"
I Actually Watched This Movie Today And It Was Amazing. The Songs Are Literally Stuck Inside My Head.
Is that mr bean
Run judgment is here!!!!!!!!! Lol
Nothing will ever be as close to my heart as Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka.. 😢
Should have been named Willy Woke. Such an insult and theft of the work of Gene Wilder’s artful masterpiece.
Your scarf is belong to Uzbeks' tradition and products?
This looks terrible
I didn't like it . I think the old one was better.  But that's my opinion
Loved this movie! Great for kids and adults!
"Yeah, I love Willy Wonka"
"As an auditor, I felt so connected with some plots in this film. Only thing different is, in the film the chartered accountant is virtuous and conscientious, but in real life, very often they're part of the horrendous, incriminating game. What's more appalling is, since they're conversant with auditing and accounting standards and related laws and regulations, they're adept at conducting misdeeds and getting benefits from it in a lawful fashion."
"This forced diversity is getting so annoying. Isn't this movie supposed to take place in Europe? Realistically, there should only be white people in the cast."

Hey there is Mr Bean Rowan Atikinson
"영화 너무 감동적이고 재미있었습니다. 지금까지 별 느낌 없이 먹었던 초콜릿들이었지만, 앞으로는 초콜릿 먹을 때마다 꿈과 동심의 세계로 여행을 떠날 수 있을 것 같습니다!"
I liked Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka from 20 YEARS AGO better.
I'm going to see this in theaters tomorrow I'm so excited 😊 ❤
She Wonka on my Willy till I chocolate bar
i thought it would charlie would be run the new wonka factory
will 4 year olds like this???
"Oh, the symbolism. IYKYK"
Oliver Twist🇬🇧 + Les Miserables🇫🇷 + Boxtrolls📦 + Charlie and The Chocolate Factory🏭 = Wonka🍫
hugh grant oompa loompa was very yawn inducing but paterson joseph made a terrific villain and timothee chalamet is almost always fun to watch onscreen. i don't think we need these remakes and i long for the day the studio system notices us tiring of them but this one wasn't the worst offender at all. bonus points for panto olivia colman
"Wait, AMC has $5 movies every day. They aren't new releases but they have them."
"Hey Timothée Chalamet ! Who cares about Wonka, WTF happened to Dune ? 🤣"
That’s not the real Willie Wonka.
I love it wonka trailer but still my favorite movie is charlie and the chocolate factory ❤❤❤❤ such a speaking is true old is gold 😢😩
YES THERE IS ROWAN MY CHILDHOOD
lol😂
How embarrassing.
"This was the second best version of Roald Dahl‘s Wonka Character 
The first one was Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory 
I didn’t care for the Johnny Depp version"
There is only one W.Wonka and it is Johny Depp.
"You had to be really high or really drunk if you said this movie was actually good. Seems expectations for this movie was just too high. First movie is 10/10 but this movie some how managed to be 2/10. This is impossible if you consider that this is a wonka movie and could have been so much more. This movie trys so hard to be a disney movie but fails in everyway. Nothing but a money maker, DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GARBAGE."
"Its hard to believe that this Wonka is the same as Chocolate Factory Wonka. This Wonka is very lively, cheerful, and so much positive energy. If its gonna be a sequel please dont end it like 'JD' Wonka"
Is this film good for 8 year old
Went to see the movie today and much better than the last 2
Was a great great watch😊
WOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PLACE TO START AND TO LEARN 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤❤❤
yall are making another one?
"Hi, Willie wonka. I'm a big fan. You can do me a favour , but i'm from"
I miss how un excessive movies used to be
The kid I’m babysitting is gonna watch the wonka movie
"A pure joy and inspiration! Never stop to imagine, create and share with others - that's the message😌"
Taking my kids. For the kids.  Typical. Looks over Diversified. And CGI through the roof!
sorry but this looks horrible...why do they bother making these classics over and over? Dude is just not quite right to have the lead. I don't think I would be able to get through it.
"Way better than I thought it would be. Easily tramples all over that terrible 70s movie that spat on the source material, easily on par with the 06 film!"

Looks stupid...
"Hollywood is repeating itself with bad movies; because making money is all they care about, they can no longer develop or deliver decent content to the screen. I'm sick and weary of Willy Wonka, Superman, Batman, the Avengers, and everything."
"The new Wonka movie had outstanding actors and sets. But... it really had a poor script. If you're going to make a movie based off an outstanding original, it had better be sooo goooood. I was bored through most of the movie until the last song. The movie just wasn't magical at all. It was like people trying to force a laugh."
Willy Woke Wonka 👎🏼
this movie was amazing in the theaters
"I dont even like musicals but this movie was great. Well written, well directed, and wholesome without even an ounce of wokeness. This film is what Disney wishes it could produce. Well done Warner Brothers! 👏👏👏"
Nice video❤😂🎉😢😮😮😅😅😅😊😊😊😊
"Watched it last night, funny and very well edited/ designed"
"This is sad.
A tradie trying to score off a pro"
Tbh I like this movie a lot but i like johnny depp's acting better it has a lot of humour in it and plot twists.
Today I watched it and omg it’s so good and sad
"Is this a prequel?
His back story seems different
The Johnny depp version he's a child of dermatologist
But in here he's just a peasant child
🤔"
Watch this. No political bullcrap and it's actually a really good movie.
"Oompa, Loompa Dupitt, he do I’ve got a tragic tale for you"
"Oompa, Loompa, Dupitt, he do you’ve got a tragic tale for me"
"I cried like a baby in the ""For a moment"" sequence. BEAUTIFUL film ❤❤❤❤"
Hahaha his name is WILLY!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
"Great acting, directing and yes, Hugh Grant was the best 😂 Fun movie 🎉"
Rowan Atkinson’s “Run Away!”. A nod to Monty Python perhaps? Please someone let me know!!
of course there's gonna be a black female sidekick
That's a awesome
Great trailer
Boring movie. I left theater after 30 minutes
Vou assistir por causa do namorado de kylie jenner
I really did not like the movie...
Load of work nonsense.
Kocham mogę nawet być w tym filmie nadaje się❤🥹🥺
"Well I bought this thinking it would be good. Turns out it's absolutely packed full of musical renditions. It's a bloody MUSICAL, but nowhere in the trailers does it say this! There's rarely more than five minutes between one song finishing and the next one starting.

If you don't like musicals, BEWARE of this film."
Usually don’t like remakes but I think this has potential
😀💙💜🎩💡🫖🍫🍬🍭🎵🎶
I Like Willy Wonka
Soooo good ❤❤❤
🤢🤢🤢
Best Movie ❤❤❤
😈 Wonka!!
mid movie ngl
1:02 mr bean
Absolutely incredible
i don’t care what critics and haters says I loved every single bit of this movie <3
"The Visual effects in the movie were beautiful, but the dialogue and everything else was terrible. Sorry,  the movie is not worth viewing even if the tickets were free."
Is it just me or do one of the characters look like Hitler?
Çocukluğumun filminin devamı bu fragman bile beni duygulandırdı sinemada izlemek için sabırsızlanıyorum

Just watched at last and 2 things yes same dress as Gene Wilder storyline similar great to see actors like Rowan Atkinson the butler from downtown Abbey and a couple of others ommpa loompa man as I surprised the original loompa man already passed but still enjoyed it 😮
"Just saw this movie and it’s one of the best movie theatre experiences I have enjoyed since Top Gun Maverick. No woke agenda’s, just great filmmaking and storytelling"
It was a great movie 🎉
We need Johnny depp
He’s so frickimg hot
this sucks
My little daughter and i enjoyed this movie ❤ would watch it again 😊 very cute and funny made! We loved it!!
"Nobody compares to Willy Wonka. I would pay a limb to speak to him. Entire cites would burst into song from his pure passion. He made chocolate with utter sincerity and even an innocence. It’s restored the life in me. Every piece of chocolate he made was a banger. Wonka, chocolatier connoisseur & cutie<3😭"
"Timothée Chalamet is so charming in this movie, those eyes! I like the fact that they made Wonka less crazy but still not too serious. Hugh Grant is perfect for an Oompa-Loompa lol. Entertaining movie. I love the message against corruption and the ""cartels"" of this world."
Where can i watch it?
I saw this movie In the Ceneplex cenimas and i HAD TO WATCH IT 1000000/1000000 best movie i ever WATCHED
Ugh. nooo... I was skeptical at the johnny depp remake but was pleasantly surprised. can we just leave it at that and stop milking it?
"Calah Lane's acting was atrocious.

And the music was garbage. If you're going to have a musical, the music needs to be good. This was just forgettable filler. Reminded me of the lousy music in Mary Poppins 2 that was crammed in....Overall 3/10."
Good movie
Çok güzell
I’m going on a date with myself to watch it a second time because I just loved this movie so much the first time.
20mins in and I'm good never asked for a musical
Super unexpectedly good wasn't rushed or forced like most modern movies everything was perfect loved the details from the original it left. Made me full of creativity and hopeful like when I was younger❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Movie sucked 0.5 out of ten
The little girl is a horrible cast she can't act..poker face 🤦🏻‍♀️
Why are we continuing to ruin classic movies?
Harika 😮
Very nice.
awsomeeee
Çok iyi film
I wish Johhny Deep play again 😢

It was a fun twist to the regular Wanka movies. More on the musical side but it had an interesting plot and more engaging for the children 🎉🎉
çok başarılı 🎉
Muazzam bir film kesinlikle izlemeliyim tavsiye ediceğim
"macera dolu, ilginç görseller ve ortaya müthiş sonuç"
That is just incredible. Good quality and better content
Sürükleyici bir filme benziyor önceki filmden dolayı güzel olacağını düşünüyorum.😂
Güzel
I thought say she is a short wonka and his hair color is green 💀
I'm glad the trailer gives away 90% of the movie
good movie i just didnt expect it to be so musical..after the high standards of charlie and the chocolate factory
Good but can't beat Johny depp
bro the trailers have the best scenes
Beautiful movie we loved it ❤❤❤❤
"I was quite skeptical but decided to give this movie a try. I'm glad I did. It was good. Great job with the story, actors, and actresses."
1:44
IM ONLY WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET
what a load of wonk...
I love this movie I watched and it's amazing such a masterpiece
"Just watched it. It was such a fun movie but way too much singing and all the songs were pretty bad. I know it's a musical but this is too much, 70% of the movie is filled with singing."
The songs were very entertaining. I loved scrub scrub.
Oompa Loompa don’t dibe do I got a bad feeling about you
chocopocalypse lol!
"Endrik, 17 anos, jogador do Real Madrid e vilão do Wonka"

Well… I wouldn’t want to have to fill Johnny Depp’s shoes either. Cute movie for children though.
🌝🍿✨  LA DODGERS  🖤♠️🌞
This role was made for Michael Jackson
"This trailer doesn't do it justice. This movie is surprisingly good!!! Of course, if I knew it was a musical, I probably wouldn't have watched it. But boy, am I glad that I did!! This movie is thousand times better than that Tim Burton stinker of a remake."
A prequel that we didn’t want but we loved ❤️
"The Chocolate
Is a Metaphor
For Poetry...!
WOW !
(:"
I want a sequel
"Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Keegan-Micheal Key.
Now thats a cast you wouldn’t wanna miss"
The movie was actually a bit dark... Way dark for a children's movie😂
"The greedy always beat the needy 
True to the day"

why tf this is musical
oompa loompa dobatedo i got at ragic tales for you.
It's a good movie
Did I just see Mr.Beans?
Why tf is he married to a diversity h1re? Movies are ruined wake me up when we go back to reality
I loved it
I actually found it bad... Sadly..
This was a good film!
I watched your show at the movie diesel. Cause. I begged my mom and jose yes
Easily top 5 of 2023 films
"Literally had no idea this was a musical. It was such a shame because I love a good musical, but I just didn't think any of the songs were memorable."
Why so much hate on this movie its actually beautiful❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
too young... john goodman or keith david
"I just loved the ending, a pure homage to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, it was just brilliant and so colourful. A modern take on the waterfall room in the original movie. Just loved the whole movie, and to repeat what's been said Hugh Grant a lovely and just brilliant Oompa Loompa. No wonder it made so much money at the box office."
Anyone seen the movie
"No Johnny Depp????
Nah."
"OOMPA LOOMPA DUPADI DOO
IVE GOT A TRAJIC TAIL FOR YOU

OOMPA LOOMA DUPADI DOO IF YOUR WISE YOU LISTEN TO ME"

I ALREADY WATCHED WONKA

Gubvu .
I went to the movies yesterday and dang it I loved ittt ❤️
Kkekskekekekkd
This is just a prequel
I was sooo skeptical with TRULY low expectations for this movie but it is So GOOD! So fun! Expectations blown out of the water!!
"People shited on the trailer but this movie is cute and cool❤.
Like a feel good movie"
0:04 was a good scheme
I’m finna go to  the movie theater to watch this🎉 2:27
Hindi Dubbing plz upload ❤
A little bit of a dead trailer to be honest
Is this movie already out
Cool movie
Nothing can replace Johnny Depp wonkas movie!!!
#9 Highest Grossing film of all time 😊❤😊❤😊❤😊
Ok
I called my wife an Oompa Loompa she won't talk to me now
"Timothée Chalamet surprised me with his beautiful voice and charm, this role suits him so well, we even see glimpses of Johnny Depp's Wonka in his mannerism, he has a childlike spark in his eyes and his outfit is beautiful especially his coat 😍

Never thought I'd see Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa but it was the most hilarious part of the movie and the song and dance really get stuck in your head 😂

Loved all the cast, each one in their own unique way

The script was clever

The story was heartwarming

The musical numbers were so colorful and held the story together... The songs also are easy to sing along to and memorable 🥳

Sure there was much more cgi than practical sets which we miss seeing in the movies nowadays but nevertheless it was mesmerizing to see

You will also definitely crave chocolate after seeing it and someone should count how many times the word chocolate is said in the movie 🍫

My IMBD rating is 9/10"
Cool. The characters do look alike👏So is this supposed to be the story of how Wonka became the famous Wonka?
Mr. bbbbbbbbeeeeeaaaaannnnnnnnn
No johnny depp then movie is bulshit
Just saw it.  Underwhelming.
l   love   wanka    so    much
"Watch it yesterday,and realize I should have tried to watch this movie in December ! My god loved loved loved !! What was your favorite scene ? Mines was the balloons so magical ❤️❤️❤️"
Oompa loompa i don't know dude i got a bad felling about you
can we get a jonny deep ..
Camilla the only fans girl is an inbred and smelly down there
The kids
I think the old people from the original movie
"I would like if Johnny Depp did that role again, I think it would just be somewhat amazing to the viewers."
"Dear Casting department-
This is NO Willy Wonka!
This is like Billy Wonka a joke"
"Too bad the trailer doesn't say anything about this movie being a musical, but it was enjoyable to watch"
Ruby gillman in Roblox Water park movie
"Congratulations kid, you've got a job based on your colour, not cos of your talent. Box ticking"
Finally! A movie about the history of diabetes and cancer. This should be educational!
This was actually a very good movie
I watched 'Charlie & the chocolate factory' long time back.. now I'm here 🍫😊
I freeked out when I saw the.word harry potter
Is that rowan atkinson)mr bean at 1:02
"I never thought that I would be so excited watching this movie. It seems that I became a child again, my inner child had opened. It’s worth watching this movie especially when you watch it concurrently with your family❤"
I like it
I like it
Saw this film today. This definitely needs a sequel
I like the remake with Johnny Depp better.
ok atleast this one doesnt look like it would traumatize a kid or a 11 year old
i wanted more focus on the ompa lompas
Way Lami
Why...
This movie was sooo gooodd...🥹🤍o my word
I SAW MR BEAN
"woow the trailer alone is a pain to go through, imagine watching the entire movie"
I couldn't even get through the trailer because of the bad cgi
"Excuse me, is it available on DVD, BLU RAY & UHD 4K, please?"
i started to watch this online on a movie site i hate going to the theaters its not that bad of a movie
They just ruined this whole movie for me
Please tell me I'm not the only one who is blatantly pissed off that he says SCRATCH that instead of STRIKE that??!!
I finally watched amazing ❤
IG as long as the normies are impressed (jingles keys) there you go
This is one of the few prequel movies that didn't make me dissapointed
ah finally got a disney movie from WB bros
"I cried at the end, not because of a happy ending, but because I've been watching Willy Wonka movie about aa hundred times and this sequel reminded me of my childhood"
This was apart of all are lives now we get this ❤ amazing and I'm 30 and a male lol
"Telugu people feel proud after hearing the telugu film songs in Hollywood films..

1) Wonka Chocolate above film.."
Flop movid
❤❤❤❤
"the movie is too diverse, i agree with that, too much blackness , other than that is was really good"
Disliked it left 20 mins into show 👎
This will either be absolutely fantastic or absolutely terrible. I hope it's the first one.
Не впечатлило🤷‍♂️
And this is the origin of how Wonka chocolate factory
"just watched this, W movie!!"
I got used to Johnny Depp's version of Willy Wonka 🫣.
"Is it available on DVD, BLU RAY & UHD 4K, please?"
It also works exactly like hotel in Willy Wonka.
"Dude was just phoning in, wasn't even trying."
Was that Mr bean
L MOVIE SUCKS
Nothing is better then the first one so good
I watched this with my wife and we really enjoyed it.
no else noticed mr bean? (1:40 - 1:43)
Abc if u love love willy       (by me a 9 year old)wonka and oompa looompas
The girl is black because she's a chocolate girl
Now this is how you do an film anniversary
Johnny better!
"It would be truly original if they pictured Wonka as the colonizer that exploited cocoa from the tropics and then boasts himself for making the ""best"" chocolate in the world"
Why does the music at the start sound like a disney star wars movie
I saw your movie before where we Wonka
This film is shite worst film this year first 1 best ever I've got a golden ticket
I wish I could have seen this
Such a shame that the film maker couldn't resist the clamour for nonsensical wokery.
"Wasn't Wonka a serial killer? 
Also, how many Wonka's do we need? This is the 3rd face already."
"this movie was better than I expected, dare I say, best movie for the past year I have seen"
Film was as bad as i thought
Just watched the opening of the film and now want to stab myself in the eyes with forks what utter rubbish who wrote the utterly rubbish songs the disney channel sorry can't put myself through this .
"I think this is a future classic, kids watching it now will grow up with this version of Willy Wonka and these new songs in their hearts. Everyone involved did a fantastic job and it's right up there with the best family films."
So joyful to watch ! I watched it with a big smile on my face made me so happy AND I'm definitely craving chocolate🤍❤😂
"This smacks right dab in the middle of the other two movies with the original being on top of course, but it's still no small feat to surpass charlie and the chocolate factory. The songs and jokes are also great, extremely catchy and come with many different connotative meanings behind them. Overall 8.5/10"
❤❤❤
"Yeet, skirt is now doing a Wonka musical movie?? He came a long way LOL"
"This movie was great. I'm glad this actor guy got a role that he was perfectly suited for, as I kind of hated him for Dune. And it was super fun to see an origins story for this character. Really wasn't expecting it to be this good, usually when they're milking established characters and making prequels and that kind of thing it's terrible, but they did a really good job here. Could have had some slightly darker undertones to really drive it home, but overall this was fantastic, really enjoyable."
Part 1 is KING.
Saw the movie. And WB has failed again. Awful!
A children movie with no LGBTQ ...
"The begining  was nice, the rest more like so so. 80 % of the scenes where much  too dark.
Mr. ""Bean"" appears there for 3 seconds, just like in thie trailer. It's not worth the money."
"The trailer, I viewed is fantastic. Looks like an amazing watch. From the costume to special effects, set ect. Beautiful,  absolutely B.E.A.U.T.I.F.U.L! How funn.! 2:27"
"So, Tim, you're afraid to put straight white guys aged 30/50 who aren't stupid? Well then, Tim? Well, we're boycotting your next movies, Tim. Love Tim."
"This should be Johny Deep movie ....they had no rights to remove actors from film industry and affect billions of peoples,what kind of stupid pathetic punishment is that.They are pathetic."
more diversity garbage
People who watched Charlie and the chocolate factory 🗿
Somebody told me the movie wasn't that good it was strange out here
Fell asleep half way through... please don't waste your time watching this... if you like the Johnny Depp version this is a complete barf show... make new movies please!!!.... stop remaking classics and completely ruin it for people who actually enjoy real acting
I just saw Mr Bean
Woke
I just booked for Tuesday to go to Willy Wonka too
"just watched the movie today and i absolutely loved it so very much 😃💜 its officially in my top 3 fav movies of all time along with the matrix and it (remake) , what a magical experience they really did capture the essence of what it means to pursue your dreams and make them come true 🥺 it reminded me very much of my childhood self and the dreams ive held on to all this time and just how important it is to keep trying, u just might change the world"
Another woke disaster? No thanks.
there are websites that tells you if a movie is woke or not and why. not watching this garbage
The movie is more Disney than Disney itself...
Trash!!!
"I was totally disappointed after watching this movie. ""2 out of 10 """
"The worst movie. DOH should step up to ban this movie. It promotes unhealthy habits. Look at  that one guy, it become obsessed.  😂"
Really enjoyed this movie and Timothee and Hugh’s performance 😂❤
"Just finished watching it! And what can I say but, I am inlove with this movie! I now love Timothee Chalamet!"
His so hot
"Huh, I wasn't moved. Cute but rediculous."
To be honest it’s a great movie for Adults! I just saw it and tbh it open my mind of “thinking outside the box”. Best recommend movie to watch if you want to have ur own business or put it this way a “Entrepreneur “!!!
This is beautiful 10/10 I could taste the mood the movie give wonderful 👏 this  is amazing beautiful thank you to the creator y’all just sparked my imagination 🎉
"honestly, it looks pretty bad."
Wonka: I put my thing down flip it and reverse it
charle &chocalate factory
the new Characters is willy Wonka 😮😮😮😮😮
"This kids good, after Dune I'll watch anything he's in!"
Loved it!! 🎉🎉
"A dazzling array of perverts, grotesques, gluttons and miscreants. An allegory for the filth of capitalism, drowning the world in sewage and the delusions of liberals who believe they can tame this monstrosity. The horror is real and visceral."
"yawn..erm..which part of the book is this? 
smh"
"Has any one noticed that most rising stars in Hollywood are of one religious group? Has anyone noticed that all they do is help each other and work against everyone who is not part of their group? It's amazing to me that while millions are struggling to enter this industry, it's the ones who are part of this group who are given an advantage. This needs to stop, we're all just letting it happen. I never understood till I realized that Timothee Chalamet (Dune, Wonka, etc) is part of that group."
An insult to Gene Wilder.
Jonny depp this already much better
stupid musical I was so looking forward to this but the musical side of it ruins the whole atmosphere of being magical the old movie is much better and no stupid singing
Should of been Johnny Depp
Wait is this Musical?😢
Not a good movie . Unsatisfied 😢
The plot is a giant mess and this is easily the worst portrayal of Willy Wonka. Chalamet’s worst job yet. I thought the songs & everything technical besides the special effects and lip syncing were good though
I feel like I’m supposed to like this but tbh the trailer bores me
Chocolate maker? Chocolatier is what you meant.
good movie
Let's replace the chocolate in this movie with drugs and everything starts to make sense
"I’ll be honest, this movie looks horrible. I’m just now finding out this was a new movie too 😂"
Boring
doesn't look as good as the last one
looks dumb
So incredibly ghaaaaaaaay!!
"I didit
It didin work"
I saw mr bean 😂😊
Beyond awful!
"I give it a 2 out of 10. Great actor... Definitely captured the heart of a dreamer and he was the only wonderment of the whole thing. The storyline of the scrub lady and the other chocolatiers ruined the movie. It was the main focus and that was a huge problem for me. No memorable songs. The big reveal of the factory was too digitalized and nothing wow. Hugh Jackman was funny. I feel like any true fans of Wonka could have written a better storyline. I was beyond disappointed in Charlie and the chocolate factory because even though Johnny Depp is my absolute favorite, his character was forcibly awkward. Definitely showed how it was more like the book though and the scary aspect shined through but, his character was more annoying if anything and didn't capture the real dark ess it should have. This prequel to how the factory came to be should have been better. The songs should have been more magical and powerful. I mean it's about the build up to pure imagination. All the magic came from Timothee Chalamet yes but, they should have focused more on him. Not the scrub lady and other chocolatiers trying to ruin him. That should have been a one and done and on to the next. Won't watch again."
i thought the other remake was bad but this is horrid
No asians or Hispanics why only add blacks to white movies?
"Are all these comments fake? They are all the same. ""Saw this movie yesterday blah blah blah""."
Bad
My childhood :0
THAT LOOKS SO STUPID
This guy is a Zionist that supports genocide
There is only one wonka ....Johnny deep
The number of fake good reviews in this comment section is insane.
This looks like it's going to be terrible.
It was very good I wached it 😂
I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE WONKA MOVIE EVER EXISTED-

Amazing movie!!!! Why can't they make Disney remakes this awesome?????
Bro the way he changed from a yelling tone to soft tone so smoothly gave me chills🥶🥶
I watched the movie at the movie theater

Why does he have a slave?
This movie was soooo goood
Wow this movie a hit and dating billionaire Kylie wow ❤ s/out to him ❤

0:06 and I'm something like a crusher/simp"
Wi  be making it to the theatres with this one🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🗣️🔥🗣️
"Just saw this movie yesterday and it was fantastic!!!! There was more singing that I thought there'd be, but it was seamlessly integrated and never took you out of the story. The effects and references were perfect, and truly made for an excellent origin story of Wonka! An absolute joy to watch (especially for choco-holics!)."
MR BEAAAN
Gross.. Timothy is just playing himself whilst saying the lines.. garbage movie idea
millennial humor the movie
"A boring film to start, with a surprisingly heart warming ending. For an origin story it wasn't really that interesting & the acting was ""millennial"" though the best acting comes from the Ompa Lumpa. Never a dull moment when the Ompa Lumpa was on screen. Over all even with a heart warming ending, I wasn't impressed, would of rather scene a story involving Wonka and the Ompa Lumpa. Save your money & watch the Ompa Lumpa scenes online."
Wow ❤❤❤❤❤❤you.     are.    the.   Best ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bold move to remake Willy Wonka in downtown Detroit...
I saw the movie yesterday.  Not bad just wish I knew it was a musical.
This movie was absolutely wonderful! So creative and respectful to the original film. The dancing the music everything was fantastic
"I saw it yesterday, and I left the theater sobbing because it was so beautiful and sweet (no pun intended)."
Shouldn't a musical be advertised as a musical.
Love this movie
I just came here to see how many token black characters were now going to be forced into the movie.
"Loved it, kids loved what a great movie"
I’m going to watch this in the theater today yay
"his gf is Kylie, Jenner In irl"
OMG IS THAT ACTOR WHO I THINK IT IS!!
0:47 he looks so silly 😜👉🏻

"Nicely done but nothing better than Johnny Depp
I’m sorry"
"*Thank you for destroying the original Willy Wonka's image I always had. I never liked this fellow with the french name, and now I like him even less*"
Mr bean
"I love Charlie and the chocolate factory. Tbh everything that Roald dhal has ever written is amazing. And to see exactly how Willy became Wonka is amazing. It’s like a back story of the original y’know, though this time it has nothing to do with Charlie."
never realized half the uk were black in Victorian days
I have been to the ❤🍭🍬🍬🍫🍫
"Timothy is such a natural actor, he has a career for life! My daughter adores his acting and loved Little Women, as did I. She could not stop talking about this film when she went to the Cinema with her Dad. I am looking forward to seeing it at home. Bravo!
 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏"
Ahh hope this is more fuel for my favorite fan theory of wonkapiercer
"I didn't checked that this is a musical and I had a really hard time in the cinema, absolutely hated this movie

U gotta be a reaaaally big musical fan to be able to enjoy this movie"
"sorry, but that was ...not good, left a cinema after an hour or smth"
It was necessary to make a new one?
Hey laxybox how are you today I’m sending you on Wednesday morning ayo new movie wonka it’s lit 🔥
Trash
Not bad
"Way too much dark chocolate in this movie. Pass. Shame, it started off as something I’d watch."
yk the movies good when you come back to watch the trailer
Everything about this movie is perfect. Only i think tim as wonka is too pretty. 😅
"I did not like the movie much, however, the trailer was EPIC"
No one beat Johnny depp whatever actor comming this character only suits Johnny depp 😅😅 Willy Wonka
These ommpa looks amazing the Johnny depp one was terrible colorful and this looks like a older time just like original
This one looks better then that Johnny one this 1 has nostalgia and looks older te
Why do this if ur going to do it so the glass elevator one the Johnny depp one was already creepy nothing like orofinal
"So, the title of the movie is Wonka, which we all know is about his incredible Chocolate Factory, but the factory opens halfway through the movie and then goes out of business all in the blink of an eye. Then the movie goes off on a tangent about a little girl named Noodles who cannot find her mom but then does. Another woke movie—fail—except for Hugh Grant who played the Oompa Loompa. Well done, Hugh!"
"Just saw it.
What an awesome story and so well done!
Deserves an Academy Award!"
I’ve watched the movie!
❤💕
"in this movie, it have best actress and it have amazing & funny moments at all i love this movie"
The only problem I had w this film was casting Timothy as wonka. His energy was off for this character.
Watched this yesterday.. Was a Treat.. Triggered nostalgia 😊
Where can I watch this??
Why does the actor that plays Willy Wonka look like Jacob Frye from Assassin Creed Syndicate
I saw this movie a few days ago and it was so good i especially loved Noodle and Willys bond
I loved this but his singing was so relaxing I kept dozing off bc I was so comfortable lol
what is the title of the background music (i think its a classical music?) used in this trailer?
It’s like the perfect combination of Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder.
he is cute
a giraffe is crazy
where's Johnny Depp?
"Timothée, Chalamet is my new fav actor"
“Here we go mama” hits hard
No.
Fantastic movie enjoyed by our entire family.
I think it looks boring
Seen it not gonnna lie great movie really enjoyable family film .
"Anyone else thinks the this is the handsomes Willy Wonka of all, no, just me??????"
"I thought the movie was pretty good.  I was pleasantly surprised and it was enjoyable. The singing isn't overdone, and the numbers are short. I liked the sets, the costuming,  the cast,  and the imagination. The CGI was fitting. The story was entertaining,  highlighted with some comedic elements. It was nostalgic to watch a new movie about Wonka.  I would rate it a 9/10.   🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍬🍬🍬🍬🍭🍭🍭🍭🍭👏👏👏👏😊"
No thanks
"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where my two favorite movies growing up. 
I actually got a bit emotional during the movie because it felt like i had the chance to see those movie i loved for the first time again!"
imagine staring in a movie with TIMOTHEE CHALEMET!?
"Its better than the Johnny Depp one, but doesn't really have the pull Gene Wilder managed."
ive not seen this it's bad i hate it and it should stop because is say so. 
"Everything in this factory is edible, just maybe stay away from whatever has peaches in it."
"this movie was so much better than i anticipated, i’m ready to watch it again 😭"
I LOVED HOW ITS WAS SAD BUT TURNED AWESOME AT THae END! But why did you destroy his shop?😭
"I watched it and it was way different than I thought I hate to say it but I kinda liked it 
It’s not like the other Willy wonks movies"
Seen this today and i must say too much singing they had a song ever 10 mins other than the music it was fine though i would not recommend it
"I find it baffling that pretty much the entire cast is British, but doing american accents? Why not just set it in England like the other wonka movies? Would make more sense. Unless it is but somehow they all have American accents anyway?"
this movie was so good but i kinda wish i didn't watch it bc now i have a crush that i cannot stop thinking about 😭😭
Kendall is happy
this was the best movie i’ve ever watched i really recommend it

I watched this in a movie theater it's my FAVORITE MOVIE ITS SO GOOD BRO ITS... TO GOOD!!!
What a fine establishment.
But why the guy from call me by your name.
I love this movie so good😊❤
Tooo much singing overall great film. The one line i love was once we sing it'll get stuck in your head... Yeah lets hot do that. Too late once we start we cant stop.
"Wonka's, Horrible Histories. the Six Idiots and various other UK actors. Worth it just to see Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson."
Cheeseburger there's no cheeseburger only chocolate
So my Mandela effect is I swear the 70’s version was called Charlie and the chocolate factory. With the Jonny version being Wonka’s chocolate factory. 🤷‍♀️
"People say that the older version is better but it is a really bad comparison since both movies concentrate on different climaxes' of Willy's life. If you loved the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder then you will absolutely love this version of the movie. Though if you have mommy issues, unfinished dreams you gave up on, or feel as if you have no sense of direction to where your going in life this will make you bawl. 

you have been warned."
Хороший кино
Oompa lompas look like my brother
Congratulations Timoothée
Nostalgia movie but this is very amazing
"WOWZERS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! With all the positive awesome comments, I absolutely have to see this movie now.. Never really been into the musical thing , but from what everyone else is saying about the show, I think it's time I change my opinion on musicals and can't wait to see this. 
Thanks everyone for the great comments, you've all changed this guys mind lol..."
"Every 5 mins was a musical, like show more of the movie"
Wanka
I just watched the movie!!!!

"""Welcome to the Choco-Industrial Complex, Kevin."""
I don’t want to know Wonka’s origin story. I’m good with Gene Wilder’s version.
"My review. Take the ""o"" from wonka and throw it away as it is no longer needed. Now take the ""a"" and put it in the place that the ""o"" has vacated. To summarise I didn't like it. 1*. The 1* is for Hugh Grant as he was the only redeemable thing in this awful film."
"It was really cringe and had a painful soundtrack… sad to see such a great opportunity waisted, it had nothing related to the real Willy Wonka and the original story"
Its a 10/10 it has mr bean.
what is this
Willy Wonka from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 😊❤❤❤
"1:45

“Here we go Momma”"

"“gOoD mOrNiNg StArShInE tHe WoRlD sAyS hElLo!” 
-Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp)"
Any movie that comes out now is woke no more good movies it's so disappointing what this world has become.
please make a sequel with timonthe…i’ll pay
Seriously the worse movie I've seen in years
I'm sure it's better than the Johnny Depp version as that movie s*cked big time!
Saw Wonka this evening with my family and to say we enjoyed every minute would be a understatement.  This remake of has finally lived up to the original and I truly hope they make a sequel with Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka.
Why are Wonka's childhood shown differently in the two films? I mean why in Burton's film did he live with his father and here with his mother?
It feels like he is imitating Johnny Depp a bit
"Мда, со временем всё становится только хуже"
Gonna watch this in the movies for my birthday! Im so excited.
"Unpopular opinion, this was one of the worst movies I have seen. Then again, it is a movie for children."
Good
"Took the kids to see it over Christmas, i was not expecting much and I was blown away. Its so much fun i think we are going to go back and see it again tomorrow!  

Would highly recommend it"
"The trailer skips from clip to clip so quickly, moves fast like a simulation, curious why the new movies move so quickly, check out the difference between this and the original movie."
I just saw this movie with my thirteen year old daughter. We both loved it! Thank you Hollywood for keeping it family friendly. No woke nonsense! Best movie I’ve seen for a long time. It reminded me of the old Hollywood cinema excellence!
Timothée was literally made for the role of Willy
EXCELLANT movie 👏🏻
Watched this and absolutely loved it.
Worst boring movie i have ever seen
this is my favorite movie now. i watched it like 10 days after it came out and its absolutely AMAZING
_this movie was really nice 4.5/5... i didn't know it was a musical but I loved it... not the best fan of musicals_
Doesn't look very good
The movie really sucked not for kids . To much singing. No action. I would think it would build to something but it didnt!
Just not into the lead actor just doesn't have the PIZZAZZ.
"This was much better than I expected, 9/10"
This is my favorite movie ever when it comes out for streaming yall should be afraid of me
I got an idea
Hate the movie and hate the actor
"Im so sad, mr beast was corrupt 😔"
"Come with wonk, and we'll wonk in a wonk of pure imagination take a wonk and youll wonk in a pure imagination"

They are so ugly stop it"
ooga booga
I just watched the full movie and its actually really good 😀
"I watched this film last night, it is magical. I liked every bit of it a lot."
Lame
this movie was so good!!!
"Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, and Timothee Chalamet. Done deal. This movie was FANTASTIC, magical, and charming. I went and saw it twice, LOL!"
"Brilliant film!  Timothée Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka.  It's such a colourful, entertaining, witty film packed full of great songs and performances.  It definitely gave me classic musical vibes like Mary Poppins, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Well worth watching.  5 stars."
"This Willy Wonka doesn't seem traumatized enough, I'm sry. Won't watch it 😂😭"
A beautiful heart warming musical! feel good movie for the whole family that I can only recommend and I will watch it again and again !
I hate wonk. Wonk is so amazing. I love wonk and i wonk to be his buddy
Why does Hollywood keep beating a dead horse.
"When wonk and wonk went to wonk factory I was sooooooo happy and when wonks dad, sir wonk, he was so hot."
"My favoruite part was when Wonka said ""its Wonking time"" and Wonked all over the place"
Wonk
Wonk
"Come with me, and you'll be, in a world of pure imagination!!!
I just saw Wonka last night, and I really enjoyed the film!!! Had heart, magic, and Timothee Chalamet was perfectly cast as Willy Wonka!!!
Cool to see the origins of the candy making genius and how he got his start!!!"

I Just saw trailer wonka movies
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
"Saw this in theatres yesterday, let me tell you, this is way better then the original! It’s more of a twist, and olden time feelings. The dancing, singing, setting and concept of the story is chefs kiss !"
"It was good, but does anyone else think the other 2 are better?"
I saw it December 16th and I loved it something like 110% ❤
Uhhh? You guys are actually looking forward to this? Ruined a classic
it's like a Breaking Bad movie but in a more polite way
nothing to see here just a lot of people defying the laws of gravity
"The trailer doesn’t do this movie justice, it is a MUST SEE!"
"This movie was simply awful, 0/10, dont go see it."
Daniel Thrasher is playing as Willy Wonka now?!
"Just saw this film. 
Its adorable and I hope lots of people go see it so we can have more films like this."
"""Here we go, Mama"" 😢"
Really great movie
I wrnt to see it today I was amazed how good this is so good give ir 10 out 10😊
"Simpleton writing, surface acting and a generic plot. What's the fuss about?"
"What did they do to wonka? why is he so silly and dumb, this is meant to be a prequel so it's important to do the character correctly,  they didn't even get the quotes wrong"
I Love it 😢❤
"A absolutely love Paddington, so have high hopes for this! 💕"
"This film really exceeded my expectations, it was just so sweet and heartwarming 🥹"
Timothee chalamet le da un toque muy hermosa a la película
"I Just Saw this Movie,It was Beautiful, Perfectly written,I grew up with the Original Charlie and the Chocolate factory,I Give👍👍Up."
i am going to see this because it has timothee chalamet
I saw this movie tonight it was garbage it wasn't that cool or good it was trash I wouldn't watch it again there's way way better movies to watch like sound of freedom john wick I love watching john wick because the action is good and john wick is a cool badass guy baba yaga john wick yeah yeah yeah 😎
MR.BEANNNN!!
2022.
"Good movie, too much singing"
Literally nobody asked for this
I thought this was gonna be another remake of willy wonka the Original Movie but this is how willy wonka became Wonka I guess the  wonderful bizzare Candy company back in the 1900
"Very cute movie with gorgeous scenes. The acting is incredible! Timothee plays a really good Wonka. This movie had lots of heart and made me cry a few times. I give this movie about a 7.5/10. In my opinion I do like the original Gene Wilder the most, it’s the best one for me. And I also like the Johnny Depp one. Of course I like this one. But nothing can compare to the original one in my opinion"
This movie was trash. 🗑️
The plot was really boring in my opinion...
"I just saw the movie and it was genuinely one of the best I've seen, let alone a prequel to a many year old original!"
This movie looks amazing. I can't wait
"Great movie, even greater message ❤️🙏✝️"
I watched today like a few hours ago in cinema and I love it!!
THEATRE FANS WHO WENT JUST TO SEE MILLIE IN THE 3 SECONDS SHE WAS IN IT?
🦋
Thanks to the customers for such a      masterpiece ❤👍
"It was good, but which one was the best, the first one with gene wilder or second one with Johnny depp, or third one with Timothy chalamet?"
"perfect movie!!!! 
best musical movie i ever seen.....
timothee chalamet amazing perfomances.................................
highly recommending this movie 
watch now!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
I wish they would stop
"This movie was really good
The plot line was great 
The characters were funny
Just a little flaw was that the acting could be a little bit better
Than it would be perfect
But overall
Pretty good movie"
Will this be available on Netflix??
I love Willy Wonka
I watched it today!
I'm so proud of Daniel Thrasher for finally having a major role on the big screen! 🙏
"Saw ""Wonka"" today and it is excellent."
In love with this movie
Someone should Sue this producer. You don't make a third Willy wonka. The second one already sucked the first 1 was the best. Don't remake s*** a third time!!!!!!!!
100 thumbs down😢
"This Movie Is So TRASH compared to Johnny Depp's. 
Unbelievable how Depp can turn Any Role Out in front of him into An Iconic Character"
Is it only me who think he is cute ❤😂
Timothy is outstanding at theater acting he is also such a relaxed good actor
It's a very excellent movie just seen it super good
Ayo is that ma boi lil mabu?😂
Looks boring
"Wasn't expecting much, yet it was amazing. Loved every second."
1995 to 2010 can only understand the feelings
"not bad not great, would specially recommand it"
Timothy you bet not snitch in jail for what you did too KYE!!!! I got some latins in there on PayPal payroll n I'm calling meechie Miko suavey
I saw this on Saturday it was beautiful ❤🥰
It's like ennola holmes🧩
So basically he goes from becoming a very nice and inspirational person who has a dream to make amazing chocolates to a cold and heartless person who doesn’t care about family and stuff???
Who else was surprised when the figured out it was a musical lol 💀
I miss johnny depp. Bro timothee is kinda average acting in wonka . I don't like it
Didn’t like it that much can never compare to Gene wilder’s version
Good thing they didn't use a little person for an oompaloompa. Wouldn't want to employ one of those and have the dinklage rage.
Good thing there's a female POC to help him out.
Is that Daniel thrasher?
"Willy, Wonka I’m your biggest fan I love u I’m your biggest fan ❤❤❤"
Now with Africans dressed in English period clothing. Let's just pretend they were a thing 😅
Willy Green and Weed Factory the sequel. 😅
No bc  Lucas Jade Zumann would slay this role…
"Just saw it today,   It was alright, Meh.   It looked like they couldn't decide if they wanted to do a Wonka backstory,  or the next Bond film, or a remake of Mary Poppins or a remake of Les Miserables then decided to just borrow from all of the above.   They certainly didn't make a lot of effort on original music.  The only memorable tunes were the melodies from the original 1971 film with Gene Wilder"
I loved this movie so much <3 It was so sweet and I almost cried 3 times while watching it
This was so much better than we all expected
always have put black in there. cant just leave things be.
"This movie is better than Disney movies, all of them :)"
"When i heard this was coming out, i couldnt believe theyd go from Johnny Depp to Timothee. Johnny was made for the role of an eccentric Willy Wonka, how could the downgrade like this? 
But i was very impressed and genuinely loved this movie. Timothee was perfect for a flowering Willy Wonka, just beginning to grow into his oddball character ❤"
I'm gonna go see it today I'm so excited aaaa
"WONKA is a STONKA -some people , well it seems a lot are easily pleased by this rubbish. Terrible interpretation of a classic-a boring and unfunny with unmemorable songs - bad casting  apart from the Coleman and Grant. I brought my friends three kids to see and they started shifting and yawning after 20 min. Instead of exciting the senses this Movie numbed the senses. It put me of going to Cinema and eating chocolate for a while."
Next time we see a Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory sequel with Matin Short as the old Wonka 😄
"Wonka was watched in theaters a second time, this time with my Mom and my opinion remains the same."
"Apparently I'm the only one that didnt like the movie... totally moved away from the original orgin story for wonka... it just didnt have the magic of the older ones.. or maybe im just a grinch..😢

Also character development wasnt the best... I cant imagine this movie being rewachable.."
"I loved the movie, it might even be my personal favorite of 2023. One thing I thought could be interesting is a Charlie and the Chocolate factory remake with Timothee Chalamet. It could be with the charm and feel of the Gene Wilder movie but a more accurate adaptation. Maybe some bits and pieces of the Johnny Depp movie, but aside from being mostly accurate to the book it isn’t very magical. I liked it and was happy it was closer to the book but that movie was very weird. But a mixture of all adaptations and the book itself starring Timothee would be an awesome movie!"
This was actually good
What... is that Mr. BEAN!!!!!!!!😂❤
This was such an amazing experience to see
This movie was such a delight. I absolutely loved it and can't wait to see it again.
The cameos ❤
He gets younger every movie…
"The film is great, the main character was not great"
Wonkas origin story 😂😂😂😂 this looks lame asf
"This movie is truly magical,  enchanting  & delightful.  It's  an unexpected story ( the trailer gives nothing away actually ), brilliantly acted with great characters ❤"
This is very bad
"Just saw it- amazing work!
Enjoyed it so much ❤
Thank to everyone who made this possible!"
"I was so excited to see this, but sadly it was awful. The songs weren't good, the storyline was terrible, it wasn't a prequel to the willy Wonka movie. Just a real disappointment"
"so well written, heartwarming, very beautiful"
1:56 High kicks there.
"I’ve left the cinéma , it was fantastic and exactly what I needed to feel good 💫.
Timothee is a natural Wonka and Hugh Grant as Ompaa is funny than ever👏🏻👏🏻"
Pile of garbage!     Bunch of fake comments on this trailer.   lol.. look at all the fake names… 😂
I loved this movie! I really want to go back to the theater and watch it again soon!
Insanely bad. The plot is just poorly written and the dialogues are plane stupid. Can’t believe horrible movies like that make it to the public
"I love the part of the movie where wonka deadpans “I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle”"
Espectacular Wonka película clásica medieval de ilusión y fantasía x un sueño difícil de encontrar.🙂👍
"Im all for it but kind of wish Willy Wonka was cast using Eddie Redmayne, Rami Malek, adam driver or tom holland."
Best wonka movie ever I hate the 2005 with Johnny deep that was the worst
MR BEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
npi: how many times are ya'll gonna remake the same movies over again.. by this time u guys should just do broad way spectacles
I remember the first one I saw at my school
Nahh I saw this movie gosh it was kinda good
Absolutely adore this movie!! Completely enchanting. 10/10
Good! ☆☆☆☆☆
i saw this in the theater it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I LOVED IT and 10/10 recommend you should see it!
Ive watched this twice now in two days this side of 2023. I feel I'll watch it again in 2024. Its a brilliant funny light-hearted film and i think Gene Wilder would have loved it. Best feel good movie so far ❤
The movie was just amazing!!!
The actor support Zionis
Disney vibes
"This movie was a complete let down. I went against my better judgment even though deep down I already knew that if they weren't even creative enough to write their own movie,  then they are definitely incapable of even being on par with what they copied. 0/10"
lol
THEY RUINED WILLY WONKA...HOW SAD
"Hugh Grant was great as a Oompa loompa, we needed more of him. He was so funny! Timothée Chalamet as Wonka was fine enough, fairly zaney and quirky. Olivia Coleman great as usual. There was  some genuinely funny moments but just as I was getting into the story they broke out into a song about every 2 or 3 minutes  🤦 I wouldn't mind if it was Julie Andrews who carried great melody and some good songwriting backing it but the songs were bland, apart from the Oompa loompa doompety doo song which Hugh Grant nailed. Timothée Chalamet didn't have a nice voice so he butchered pure imagination, he ain't no Gene Wilder. I think overall it's a good fill and silly movie that most people will enjoy, it just wasn't my cup of tea"
Terrible movie. Too much singing the acting was not good. I only finished the movie because we paid $40 do not go see
I don't know but not like Jonny dep
This is my favorite movie!
0:25 wtf lmao
It's not the same without jhonny depp
Just saw this yesterday! Love it!
Oh this movie's my favorite😍 I've seen that movie into theaters😊💗
"Loved the movie. Based on the trailer, the only hint that it's a musical are brief snippets of choreography. Same with The Color Purple and Mean Girls. 
I long for the days when musicals could be advertised as musicals."
This film is absolute trash DO NOT WATCH!
"I never really cared for Timothee Chalomet and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is okay. This looks good but it bothers me that he was recently in that cannibalistic movie, ""Bones and All"" that had a trailer that would play on YouTube. Maybe if I can forget about that I'll watch it. 

I bet theaters love this movie because they'll sell lots of candy."
Where is the bob at
"I loved Willy Wonka and was so happy to know this would be out! Timothee played Willy so incredibly! He brought the funny, sweet, and kind character too life"
Looks like trash
"This movie was a lovely surprise. Really nailed the feeling of classic musicals, oozing with whimsy and charm. Sure the CGI was a bit rough at times, but the overall package was much better than it had any right to be. Clever writing with wordplay and callbacks, catchy new songs, and solid performances. Definitely justified its existence, and then some. Bravo!"
He should've done the Wonka voice🫤
They should do a sequels teaching teens and adults have to be wise like the original children.
"Actually looks like a sweet film, I’m a little happier with 2023 cinema."
I just watched this movie and it’s pretty good
Hugh Grant stole the show....
Simply beautiful!
woke-a
Wanka
Completed misleading.
Poor. *throws up*
Day dreaming penalty😂
Its nice to see that actors of paddington and the director of paddington came together in this movir to
I’d like to know how the chocolate factory was moved from an ocean town to a town that’s no where being near an ocean
no willy wonka song ?
"This was the movie we wanted and needed! Something, magical, innocent and imaginative!! A world of pure imagination ❤"
Timmy did wonderful! Love the movie
Watched it today. Perfect family movie. ❤
How is it possible that a pre-Hispanic drink from the cultures of Mesoamerica became so appreciated by Europeans?
👀
MR BEAN !!! MR BEAN MY FAVOURITE YAYAYYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAAAAAAAAAAAAa
I'm a fan of new generation actors but when all the characters are getting by Shalomy is not right. There are many actors who can also   play and recognized
"This was an awesome movie to watch, the music, dancing and the special effects added to the story which is rare. Usually movies need the special effects to enjoy the movie which is why they fail. The main characters did a great job bringing this movie to life."
lost me at musical...
"I watched this movie and it was amazing! I almost felt like the zookeeper, highly energetic and excited! No way I can’t hope for this to end up as a franchise!"
Saw this film yesterday in theaters and it was amazing.  It's perhaps the best film I saw post 2020.
Who knew Willie Wonka was so FINE! 🤣
"0:43 He looks exactly like Daniel Trasher in that moment....
any way this movie is amazing, I would say 9/10 points :) I really recommend it."
atleast they used a dwarf nor like snow white and the seven dwafs remake
Going to see it today!
Disliked
Fantastically Delicious!! Took my two boys to see it today and it was fantastic! Timothee Chalamet definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance! Gene Wilder would be proud!!
This was a fantastic movie in the middle of this sick society. Take your kids and family.
This movie is fun.
So happy willy Wonka doesn't have  a phony English accent!
"Wtf😮 in the original book, Willy Wonka is Carribean. Roald Dahl must be turning in his grave😢."
Going to watch Wonka this afternoon at Cannock cinema in Staffordshire so fingers crossed its going to be good!
Old version is better ...
"Let me save some people 2 hours. The most boring film I have ever seen in my 35 years. The film made no point whatsoever. One of the worst ""remakes ever"" do not waste your time. Hopefully I saved a few of you 😅 and as for the lead wow. Shocking casting"
"Disgustingly bad entrepreneurs. Corruption in the police, and a rapacious church, You already know all this, not only in Wonka "
"If Willy was poor, how could he afford to make such extravagant chocolate?"
"I did not watch any trailers beforehand, and I had no clue it was a musical."
Does anyone think they did way too much with Keegan-Michael’s character?
what different of willy wonka johny deep (2005) with wonka (2023)...
Does anyone else think they did way too much with Keegan’s character?
"I just saw this movie, and I enjoyed it a lot."
Just saw it today it was so good
"Just got done seeing it, honestly it was incredible. Do not know why Timothee is getting hate. He did great"
Where in the hells our Wonka Bars. Ferrara candy better have a good explanation of how they missed this golden opportunity
"Look at all these bots commenting with the standard generic statements, ""it was so good,"" ""loved it,"" ""amazing,"" etc. Absolutely zero depth, and anyone with a properly functioning brain can see right through its transparency."
"Just watched it an hour ago, was SO AWESOME! ❤️👍"
Absolutely loved this movie. 👏🏻👏🏻
Man everything these days needs to be so fast-paced and flashy. Nothing like the original!
"I still wish they would make a sequel to the original where Charlie and his grandfather run the factory. Maybe after his grandfather dies, Charlie gets lonely and gives out golden tickets, looking for an apprentice. I feel like that would be more interesting than a Wonka origin story. But hey, i'll give them props for not rebooting the original, and showing some creativity."
"This looks interesting. I still wish they would make a sequel to the original where Charlie and his grandfather run the factory. Would Charlie be obessed with chocolate making like Wonka, or would he run it a different way? Maybe after his granfather dies, Charlie becomes very lonely and decides to give out golden tickets. But hey, at least they didn't remake the same movie, i'm glad they're doing something different."
Tim Chalamet isn't a very good actor
I seen Mr bean omg
I loved it but expected a little more nuts on this young Wonka...
Is it good?
Plastic
This IS New Right Like This Is Incredible OMG and de flowers are planting and de 🍫 water was water cream chocolate  This is still de best movie
There is a real bro Aaron 4ther is still worken inan motto
Utah weed was one of my famous not hot but cert
I'd like to see Timothee as mr.tumnus from narnia if there was a remake lol
Am I the only one who has a crush on the actor of Willy Wonka in this movie?
Just saw this movie in theater yesterday... it was AMAZING! The music and the dancing mixed together really moved me and almost brought me to tears I have to say 😂 It really felt out of this world
so disappointed the character of willy wonka is played by this talentless man
This is the type of must watch during school days after exam papers!!
"There was a lot of singing in this movie. Something I don’t like in movies. But this one was different, I loved it!"
Movie was SO good
2:05 Lord Farquaad?
"The movie was great, but every time I saw him, I was reminded of his Hamas joke, which greatly contrasted with the good-natured Wonka that he played, so I was less immersed."
THE  FILM  IS  ABSOLUTELY  D E L I G H T F U L ......  I   SAW   IT  AT  THE  WEEKEND   AND  IT  IS   A  HEART WARMING  PLEASING  CHARMER  OF  A  MOVIE.      The lead guy Timothy did a fabulous job in the role of Wonka..!!!    10+
"I just watched this today and it was spectacular! I also went into this movie not knowing it was a musical, it was a nice surprise"
I loved everything about this movie.
"Really funny, really enjoyable, kind of magical. I absolutely loved it."
I just watched this movie and it was great. Absolutely loved it.
I am seeing this
"Watched it last night. Made me cried and smiled so wide when Pure Imagination came in. What a perfect holiday movie, so magical & heartwarming. my innerchild is so so happy"
The moment I read harry potter i just knew this will be good
And it sucked!
Why does this trailer make zero hint at the fact that this is a musical??
It was an awesome movie!
At times the voice of Willy has an elevated tone which makes it difficult to understand. There are some cross references in themes to other classical works. Does anyone know is this a book? I would love to read it!
Well worth watching! Has a lot of relevant lessons. Has familiar secondary characters like Rowan Atkinson. 😁
OMG MR BEAN IN IT TOO
"Warning: shittest movie of 2023, it was like high school musical but with a weird twist of Wonka 💀"
1:42 Rowan Atkinson👀 Mr.Bean spotted 😍
Went and saw this movie it's not great.
Everyone should be aware the they are filtering criticism and any type of negative comments. Don't bother with a company that can't even make a decent movie.
This was a stupid movie! Even my kids wanted to get out of the theatre! It is a musical with I think 20 songs! if you hate musicals don't watch it!
Could’ve been a different actor
"I'll stick with the old wonka, it went wrong, very bad blow 10/0"
What is Hollywoods endless fascination with this stupid movie?
I grew up reading Roald Dahl books and loved the original movie so I was worried that I would be disappointed. No reason to worry.  This movie is magical.
Movie is terrible so much singing its shockingly bad
I just saw this movie today and it is quite a fun and entertaining musical
I watched the movie today and it is probably one of the best movies i have watched i love all the cast choices and songs
I thought I’d hate this movie. I left in tears. The ending was… magical! Amazing movie!
Excellent production.
amazing movie
"If you have not seen this movie and want to watch it, GO AND WATCH IT! It was such a beautifully written story, and the characters and cast was so amazing! You will LOVE this movie! It made mine and my family's Christmas Eve so special!"
"Glad I watched the trailer before blindly going and seeing, would've been a huge mistake!"
Wonka is my hero
One of the best movies I've ever seen. Going to see it again tomorrow.
Im a simple girl. I see reggie i watch the movie
Was that Mr. Bean saying run away?
"never laughed so hard during a movie, this movie was so funny😂😂😂😂"
The “dark white nutty absolutely insane” part is so hot 😩🥵
Mr bean reference
I LOVE THE MUSIC AND EVERY MOVIE WITH AMAZING MUSIC AND GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS I ALWAYS WILL WANNA WATCH IT
Now i shall make edits of this movie😊
Rowan Atkinson!
This movie is criminally overhated.
I am tired of the representation matters thing
Loved this film from start to the end
"Please oh please let there be no 'message'. Please don't destroy Wonka like snow white, star wars, and just about everything these days."
"Me and my wife saw this to see what the big fuss was about and how everyone raved about it. Neither one of us cared for it which alot of are friends thought we were crazy. While is was ok,I don't plan on watching it again anytime soon,if ever."
Freakin’ fantastic!!! Loved every minute of it.  Best movie I’ve seen in years
"The new Young Willy Wonka seems more like a mixture of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp’s Willy Wonkas than just being a specific one of them.
For example, Young Wonka’s outfit seems more like Gene Wilder’s Wonka with the hat and the bright uniquely patterned shirt but the general colour scheme of his outfit such as his coat looks more like Johnny Depp’s Wonka.
Timothée Chalamet’s Wonka also doesn’t wear gloves. This is similar to Gene Wilder’s Wonka but it could also be because when he got older he wore gloves to look more professional or perhaps to hide the injury scars he got in his chocolate factory.
Timothée Chalamet’s Wonka has brown hair, similar to Johnny Depp’s Wonka.
Timothée Chalamet’s Wonka’s hair is also curly, he also has an optimistic charming smile and energy similar to Gene Wilder’s Wonka."
how many rember the movie the greatest showman hugh grant played in to im for sure ty 😉
Just saw it with my daughter and we loved it. Very heartfelt...a great family film!
You can’t beat the original with Jean Wilder period it’s the best forever. These remakes of movies are getting old and ruin the legacy in my opinion.
too woke.

In my theater
"...and....here we are still being exposed to these stories written by writers who were not exactly being sensitive to racial stereotypes and being celebrated for their use of tricks with words with their opaque meanings. Dahl, like Geisel (Dr. Seuss) were very clever to use language to mask their racism and cast characters that were offensive and degrading....really, what's an oompa loompa anyway...??  🤔"
Chocolate maker with a chocolate woman gotta love it
Shoutout to Daniel thrasher for slaying this role #danielwonkaandthehoodiefactory
This movie is absolutely brilliant. Captured the original film and Road Dahl's essence.
Mr bean
"Film je realno teško sranje. Pogledao sam ga jedino sto sam ocekivao nesto bolje od Bartonovog ostvarenja, ali ovo je cisto gubljenje vremena."
L'ho appena visto e cantano in continuazione in più non è come gli altri 2 che il protagonista è un bambino il protagonista è lui e non ha un passato DA SCHIFO
"I just watched it, Its a bit of a mess. It COULD have been good but it needs alot of work to turn it into a good movie. Hugh Grant was the best thing in it."
I saw Mr. Bean😮
You know what?? I liked it. It was weird and magical.
Original movie is way better !
"""Sensitivity readers have combed over the works of Dahl, and smoothed over the edges of a notoriously sharp, spiky author, removing words and adding entire passages; Augustus Gloop is no longer “fat,” he’s “enormous” (still seems kind of mean, but ok), while Mrs Twit from The Twits is no longer “ugly,” just “beastly.”"

So we'll assume the ""sensitivity readers"" are fat, ugly, purple-haired cretins, who never produced anything in their life, that anyone will remember when they are gone!"
Wow
"I would have moved to see Johnny play in it again, unfortunately he’s probably still suffering from Ambers narcissistic life altering insanity she bestowed upon him."

"Paul King's movies restore my hope in humankind.
The entire movie is coated in charm and imagination from every single shot, performance, set, and song.

Another heartwarming film that, following the essence of Paddington, makes you feel like watching a storybook come alive."
Gene wilder set the bar where it can't be reached 🎩
Long time ago since watched a real magical american film 👏
that looks great
There’s a naked part in the movie I just forget when
Mr Bean???
"Needed this on Christmas weekend!  Awww unexpectedly lol interesting indeed!
My 20 yr old kids and I went tonight…❤ remember to DREAM!  Can’t wait for the story of Willy to come!
Namaste 🙏 Merry Christmas 🎄"
Whyyyyyy? Stop touching classic films
"I walked out.  The only 2nd movie in my life.

The music wasn't memorable, the lines were forced, characters were two dimensional, and the pacing was that of a bad Broadway show wanting to pack too much into the allotted time.

It kinda felt like the movie version of The Producers.  Great talent, but horrible direction and pacing."
dark white nutty absolutely insane 😁😁
"Wonka at first felt unnecessary to be made when I first saw the trailers, but I’m someone who grew up with both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder’s portrayal of the character. I’m so happy to say this movie was fantastic!!! Aside from some of the chocolate and the Oompa Loompa being CGI heavy, Timothèe Chalamet was a good Willy Wonka, the songs were very catchy, and I did feel that the magic and charm of the other films were in this."
"If you’re thinking about seeing this this but not sure, I RECOMMEND 100%, IVE NEVER BEEN MORE INTERESTED IN A FILM IN MY LIFE. If u like the funny, sad, musical kinda film it’s for you honestly I loved it so much"
A really good movie and I don't even like musicals.
Very wholesome movie
Looks pretty cringe lol
why are there so many black people?
"no thanks,  nothing beats the original Wonka with Gene Wilder.   This one looks sucky"
"If you have never watched the classic then it is an alright movie but if you have watched the classic Johnny Depp version then you will be disappointed. The classic is just so full of chocolate, Wonka’s weirdness, magic, wonder and the storyline is extremely strong. I really respect and appreciate the classic more now after watching this version."
Esse versão ficou muito frozo manga rosa.
It was an alright film
A life lesson with a  childhood memory👏👏 very funny as well. Excellent work to everybody
"Good movie , recalling my childhood 😊"
But he doesn't seem sadistic at all...
"HELP the songs and the dances are haunting me even in my dreams lol seriously I'm one watch away from getting diabetes, the movie just gets better and better every rewatch."
Saw the movie today and it was incredible. My favourite variation of the Willy Wonka movies. An absolute gem
Boring
Loved this movie! I watch anything that features Rowan Atkinson. I also Woke up with the Oompa Lloompa song stuck in my head 😂
This is some Mr Beast knock off Wonka
This version of Willy Wonka feels like a MrBeast knock off
This movie cured my inner child
wanka
Yesterday i watch this in sm Clark movie it was amazing
Loved this movie
Looks cringe.
we need to all of the recipes from the candy maker thing
Younger Johnny Depp could be probably better
"This film was SO much better than I thought it would be. Firstly, it's an obvious prequel to the Gene Wilder version (aka the good version), with some of the songs from the original and just some beautiful nostalgia sprinkled in. But it doesn't depend on nostalgia. It has a wonderfully unpredictable plot with humor, emotional moments, and surprising darkness and real threats and villains (involving slavery, poverty, grief, death, etc.), all portrayed in a truthful but hopeful lens for children to see. I thought it would be just whimsical and superficial but it's not. It has everything that Wish should have had. It's the kind of children's film with real threats and challenges that adults can feel engaged watching too. This kind of musical seldom gets made anymore. It's honestly very underrated, considering it's the best ""children's"" film I've seen in a long time."
"Film çok güzel, kesinlikle izleyin.büyüleyici."
"Woke rubbish. Wonka is meant to be an unsettling capitalist sociopath. I'm guessing this is a heart-warming feel good movie delight, filled with modern movie making tricks that make you believe it was a movie of substance when in actuality it wasn't. Nostalgia sells. Bums in seats. A safe movie for a safe executive profit. Go see it people, maybe Ryan Goseling will be in the next one."
"Definitely the best modern version to date. Great acting,plot and excellent characters. Found myself having to stop myself from.clapping after some scenes and reminding myself I wasn't at the theatre. Half the audience clapped at the end of the final scene. Great for all ages young and old! Definitely a classic 🎉💐"
Of course we've got a pinch of inclusivity. A white boy had to be swapt for a black girl. What a sad little world we live in.
I have a Feeling this is going to be corny af
Watched this on the 16th id say it took the honor of best 2023 movie in my eyes 🥺
There are so many black extras in Wonka they should have called it Wonkanda
Worst movie I have ever seen
when I first watched this I thought Willy wonka was Hayden  Christensen
I'm now waiting for the sequel to the original.  Want to see what Charlie did with the place once he took it over
1:03 Is that Mr. Bean I see?
"I saw it today with my best friend,  it was legendary"
This film was so great! I LOVE IT

I hate musicals!!!! But...this movie is great!
Wow I love Timmy’s voice! He has his charisma and fall in love with him!
Im divided
Since childhood always tough about wonka have dark side and his chocolate factory kinda iceberg deep down we know we can make it dark version out of it
Johnny Depp is the best Wonka ❤
"I hate musicals and was forced to go and watch it. I'm sad to say, I actually loved it."
Free Palestine 🇵🇸
Such a great movie! Thanks WB
I love it!!!!
I just saw it today and sadly the theatre isn't full at all. This is a magical movie and I really love it. I wish they will make a sequel before wonka pass down the factory. How noodles life have change after meeting her mom.
I watched n i like it
Sorry for my self it’s really disappointing and boring movie
I love that Timothee Chalamet is playing wonka
i'm excited since there's rowan atkinson in it.
1:02 mr bean thất lạc sang đây :))
"I was very skeptical of this movie when I heard about it and even now while watching this trailer but the comments are starting to push me towards going to watch the movie.

I really hope it can live up to the original  and the remake after the original that I grew up with."
The original Wonka was best.. this is silly...sorry..not sorry
"Who remembers all the hate this movie got because people thought it was another Hollywood remake? But man this was absolutely NOTHING like the other Wonka movies, Chalamet absolutely killed this role 💯"
My two granddaughters saw this and hated it. They wanted to leave before it was even over.
"My problem with this movie is how this fits in with the other two. Like I am a big fan of both Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, and it’s just hard for me to think of this movie as a prequel. It’s just completely different from anything said about Wonka’s past in the two previous movies."
looks so bad
Hmmmmm are all these comments from Bots that the Movie creators bought? Not a single person talking about how terrible the movie was. Every comment is talking about how they went and saw it yesterday and we must go see it..hmmmmm…hmmm…maybe I’m a little skeptical but I think this isn’t a real comment section or atleast half of the comments are bought bots
*92K dislikes 👎*
This movie is cute...and makes you tear up at the end!
I ju😭s🧁t ate a dun🧁kin🧁don🧁nu🧁ts ch😭oc🧁😭olat🧁emuffin😭😭😭😭😭😭 it so good it has like sprinkle suger shape like 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭salt and chocolate made like bree😭😭😭d a soft bit bit crunch😭😭y first😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭 it so good 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
2:21 is funny
This looks amazing I think I’ll go see it with my friend!
Is there no golden ticket and Willy Wonka😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮
1:41 mr bean ??????
Very Good movie.
I went to see the movie yesterday & I absolutely loved it! I couldn’t think of something else today. Must watch !
I watched the movie Yesterday and It's great
"This movie is much more ""tolerant"" than the old one. Wow...what a happiness..."
One of the worst movies i have ever seen more of a musical than a movie they targeted a 5 year old audience here just horrible.
The commercial is very Misleading
your movie SUCKS. its full of holes and you cant even get your own WOKE correct 🤣
I absolutely adored this movie.  Very heartwarming as well.
I don’t see the charm or quirkiness. Visually looks dull with lots of browns and muted golds. No psychedelia or absurdity. Not sure what the point is for another remake of this story either. Thematically it feels more wizardly than eccentric confectioner.
johnny depp is still my favorite tho.. and more funnyy. i heaed that its a musical movie more than the others but i still will watch it tomorrow at the cinema..
Should watch this I rate9/10
he looks like he should have gotten the golden ticket
Is this a prequel to The 1971 or 2005 film?
"Great film, great story! Loved this one!"
"Good movie, definitely as iconic as the past 2"
"Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa halirous, I love it ❤
There was a period where the movie was very boring. After that, it was good."
"I have watched it 3 times in my country, Indonesia.  this is an amazing film.  I enjoyed every scene with a smile, laughter and at the end tears, the story was very touching.  The chemistry between Wonka and the other characters is also very cool.  all the soundtrack songs are very addictive.  I will watch it again if I have free time."
"I LOVED IT. Magical, inspiring, funny, emotional and so uplifting ❤❤❤ this role was truly made for Timothee Chalamet - a must watch movie 😊"
"To me, when watching this trailer, it appears as if the movie doesn't really go anywhere. I'm really disappointed in the outcome of this, as (1) I don't believe young Wonka would have been wearing the same cape as his older Willie counterpart, and (2) there doesn't seem to be any footage which focuses on the factory and how he got the factory designed and built. If this part is not there at all, then I'm not sold on any kind of ""Wonka Re-envisioned"" kind of sequel. Hard pass until maybe it comes on streaming tv."
"I read Charlie and the chocolate factory when i was in 5th grade as a kid , and now i am 25 and gone back to childhood after watching this trailer....😍😍😍😍♥️♥️"
"Went with hubby and daughters and we had a great time, my daughter doesn’t like musicals but this is not the cheesy type and she loved it. And I never thought I would see Hugh Grant in this type of role and it was fantastic, I will never see him the same way again! The scene after the zoo visit was amazing!"
They waited to create this trash so Gene could roll over in his grave? Atleast they waited to make this garbage.
I don’t think so but it it 0:18
This film is amazing. I want to go and see it again. Magical.
Timothée Chalamet was the perfect person for this role
This might be my favorite movie of all time
I seriously needed this movie in my life. It has been a long time since I felt this way.
Is it out
Ma è bellissimo!!
Saw it yesterday great movie I'm sure Gene Wilder would've love it
It's good 👍
I thought Rowan died a few years ago?! Is this an old movie or did i just cry over nothing back then
11/10 really awesome i cried so many times great storyline 😭
They just kill  this movie😢
🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
"It looks kinda mid, but we'll see how ppl review it"
Wow from Malaysia 🇲🇾
We are going to this movie tomorrow with my whole school im super excited!!!
Absolutely terrible in every way
Missing Johnny Depp
My favorite movie and I’m now obsessed with acting
"Looks adorable, but he just didn’t read as wonka for some reason. Depp and Wilder did it so well and wonky that this character was just a bit too straight laced and sane I guess.  Look cute though."
1:19 is so beautiful ❤🥲
"Saw the film today and WOW, it was absolutely wonderful! ❤ It truly captured the spirit of both the 1971 film and Roald Dahl’s book. The film has the most fantastic set designs, colors, effects, which looked magical on the big screen. Holds so much nostalgia and will make you emotional. A very quality, touching storyline with an uplifting tone and brilliant acting. Music is absolutely beautiful and fantastic 🥲🎩

Tip: You’re definitely gonna need plenty of candy to snack on while watching it 😂 🍫"
"Oh, when House Atreides finds out about this, they will not be happy!"
You had me until I saw the fuzzy wuzzy.
Are they really afraid to make an all white movie these days
Awe it's so good 😊
It was a great film.
Oh how about the peach hahaha
It’s sooo good !!!
Beautiful! Magical! The music was lovely  Timothée Chalamet was perfect. Going again with more friends next week.
What a beautiful film ❤
Not surprising that the director of Paddington bear ended up doing Wonka pretty well. 8.8/10
Has anyone found where we can watch the full thing online?
The movie is so fun I love it
Im going to watch it today!
Chocolate cartel? Reminds of the episode on the boondocks 😂
Mr. Bean saying run away got me laughing so hard😂
I'm a 64 year old hardcore sailor and biker and this movie looks.......  AWESOME!!!!  I want to see it on the big screen at the theater.
Best wonka movie ever
Im excited for this. IMO they made Depp too much of a nut in Charlie & The Chocolate Factory.
IDK why but I was dying of joy 🥲
"As someone who just watched the movie and loved it, I must say this trailer is very well edited"
I just hate it that theres no hint of it being a musical
a Carol of white people whit black?
Someone needs to be really believing in a magic to play this innocent role...but loved effects!
"Wonka is not a chocolatier, he is mixing drugs."
Omg they finally making good movies again! Yes!
I'm going with my school to watch so excited 😊
"Obviously grew up on the original, charile and the chocolate factory came out when i was a teen, this one is the best of the 3 as is Timothy as wonka. The other ones didnt make me cry like this one and Paddington 2 did, absolutely must watch no matter how old"
"I will always love Willy Wonka the original, but this movie was so magical and beautiful. Everything about this movie brought flashbacks to when I was a little girl watching the original movie with my dad. Thank you for this movie! 10/10 recommend!"
"No beautiful female actress, boriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing"
Is this movie a musical?
THE MOVIE WAS SOOO GOOD
bleh
"Hes like the male version of mary poppins
But chocolatey"
Nahhh the johnny depp wonka is better
i’m gonna be wonkin my willy so hard to this
Loved the movie! @royalmovieboxx
I watched it. Its super good.
omg a normal movie people can watch without being indoctrinated by woke leftist agendas...
About Tai Lung from the movie Kung Fu Panda: Tai Lung is also a Dragon Warrior
I feel sorry for today's kids.
Doesn’t push woke makes money. Movies that push woke go broke. Anybody see a connection?
Can't believe mr bean is in this what a God and a legend 😊❤
Poor. 🤢🤮 Hweahh
Excellent!!! Timothee is extremely talented
Looks terrible
yo rs went wit my cousions for the popcorn shi was aigh like it felt like smth was gon happen first 30mins nth happend i fell asleep
Damn this movie hit hard in my heart.
"I just can’t stand Timothee Chalamet. Too bad. Might’ve been fun, otherwise. 🤷‍♀️"
never overdo it with spice
looks terrible you'd have to pay to watch this nowadays no good movies are being released
Yeet!
Musical? Damn
The original was much better 👽
Before he started killing and deforming kids 🫠
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
No. Just no. Who makes these trailers?
"I watched it and I still want to repeatedly watch it again and again, I don’t basically like musical movie (hard to understand for me) but Willy Wonka made it crystal clear ❤, the lyric is awesome"
In memory of Gene Wilder 💜
This is the most watchable piece in 2023. Well done!
This looks terrible. Let’s stop remaking already well done movies and come up with something new y’all.
Too much black people
best movie of 2023.. didnt know wt to expect  from a huge success of the orginal chocolate factory but the world this movie built is so so good and magical . amazing songs. full of houmour and just fun to watch!
"Good movie but not great. Movie seemed to be a bit of a rush job, singing not so great was borderline annoying at times. The lead actor was good in parts of the movie and weak in others. Thankfully it did not try to be much of a prequal to the original movie."
TRASH!
"I really hate this BS, hiding MUSICALS as just another movie. THIS IS NOT. if you are into musicals then go ahead."
"The movie was a musical. Plain and simple.

They delivered the warm feelings at the end with the parents to kids but it was too late"
"This movie really stunk. Once again, the writers were lazy and left the story underdeveloped. It was a horrible mess and Hollywood should be ashamed!"
The amount of times I smiled and laughed during the film! I also had several 😮 moments where the caught timothee on just the right angle and he looked so much like Gene Wilder. I think it's his jawline. Great film ❤
Bad lead actor. Why is he speaking American???
It was amazing!!
Timothée Chalamet Is one of my favorite actors💪🏼
I find it interesting that Wonka's character sort of reminds you of a mix between Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp
This movie is phenomenal
That diversity hire. ESG score approved.
😯👋🏻👋🏻😯👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻☝️🥹👍🏻👍🏻☝️☝️😃☝️☝️👋🏻👋🏻👋🏻👍🏻
"i watched the film, its very good i recommend it its like a musical i enjoyed it really much"
Highly recommend
🍡🧁🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍬🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍬🍬🍬🍫🍫🍫🍬🍬
Todo un ejemplo de meritocracia. Será una gran película.
"THIS MOVIE IS ONLY FOR CHILDEN , THIS MOVIE WAS LITERALLY A MUSICAL,THE SANG EVERY 5 MINUTES  BE SURE TO BRING A SLEEPING BAG BECAUSE YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP"
"Thank you!!!!!!! I've been waiting for this movie and it did not disappoint! 🥰🥰🥰 even the ""villains"" are also funny haha Timothee as Willy Wonka was amazing! I love this movie! 🥰 11/10! 🥳"
I cried for this movie
The perfect family movie for any holiday.
I just watched the movie in theaters today. I LOVED IT!!!!😊🍫💙
We love the movie sooo much
They’re really changing the story
DIS MOVIE WAS DA BEST IN DA ENTIRE FRICKIN WORLD
This looks horrible.
"Just took the kids to see the movie. It was awesome. As good and fun as the first.It took me back. And the kids loved it, too😂"
WWWWWWWWWonka
I hope every person on this planet will take their inner child to see this movie. Restore our belief in the power of our imagination. I laughed. I cried. I'm telling everyone I know to go see it.
"I had absolutely no idea This was a musical, and I hated every bit of it."
This is the worst movie i have watched in my life. Why people like this? Every second in the cinema was painful and boring. Extremely dissapointed. The plot is nonsense.
"Why always the same actors, there’s other actors with so much with potential"
"I was so skeptical at first because I loooove the old movie from the 1970s. But OMG today I watched it and I was blown away. This is such a great tribute to Gene Wilder, I have no words, absolutely magical!!! 100% going to watch it again"
"I went to see this yesterday and it’s absolutely magical! I love how instead of casting an older actress for Noodle and making her a love interest, her and Wonka have a more big brother-little sister relationship, it works so much better imo"
Just saw it - despite the diversity it's actually still quite good.
It's not Johnny Depp.
Warning: supermariologan 2️⃣0️⃣1️⃣2️⃣
Nothing beats Depp as Wonka.
"I really love the trailer. In fairness, Timothée Chalamet had a lot of movie characters he portrayed in his career, but this one as the iconic Willy Wonka is his most challenging role to date. Best of all, the entire cast in the movie are amazing. Anyway, I’m excited to watch it. 🙂"
❤
Ya looks garbage
Another woke movie I will boycott
Just saw this movie on Friday. Best movie that came out this year I absolutely loved it
Can’t waittt tobwatch
I might actually watch it
"Some people in these comments dont know the meaning of the word prequel, and it is telling"
"BEWARE! ITS A MUSICAL!
I have just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish."
Winli wonka i got flavour
Why not advertising it as a musical? As the whole movie were songs
Knowing the true history of the “Oompa Loompas” 🤦🏽‍♀️
Nah this finna be fire asf
He looks like a 19 years old boy.  Gene was almost 40 when he played that character.
"Did AI write this? My god, it's Johnny Deep in wonka. Wait..."
"I only watched charlie and the chocolate factory, and in that movie wonka was a some kind of a psycho, this wonka has a magical charm to it, i absolutely how magical this trailer is, and np wonder since its made by the director of Paddington and the producer of Harry Potter, i am so excited to see the movie"
"Cant wait to see this 😍, a classic i feel"
Love the movie ❤
Oompa Loompas aren't supposed to look like that.
"It doesn't look good, and is all WOKE."
Oh boy! The woke version on Wonka. No thank you!
"A fantasy about a candy maker filmed in depressing brownish gray hues?
No thanks."
"I had literally no plans of ever watching Wonka but my mother wanted to go see a movie and I chanced upon Wonka's poster in my email, the same morning. I booked the tickets with not too-high of hopes but I was surprised. The movie was wonderfully warm! My mother enjoyed it too (although I had to translate some parts for her throughout the screening). I am so happy today!🤍"
"Nice movie !!
But Johnny depp missing !🙂
Only Johny depp can play wonka 😊"
"Johny Depp powinien w nim zagrać obowiązkowo ,bez Johna to nie to 😮"
Mr bean 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
"New fave holiday movie, saw it in the theater since I don't have a giant tv setup at home"
"Wow, this is a great movie, made me cry and laugh 🎉🍫🎩🪄"
Obviously only watching it because Timothee chamlet is in it 🤩
OOMPA LOOMPA
"Uhhhhh Nope , the original is best, The Depp version acceptable and was good.
And what i want to say about this one they havent been allowing others to post."
The next sequel is the chocolate factory which already aired ages ago with low quality work. In hopes that remake will come again
Hard pass. I liked the horror of the chocolate boat ride in the Original and little kids getting knocked off for being brats.
Finally with no more woke BS. Saw this movie in theaters and it was amazing!
"From the first minute to the last, this film is a masterpiece. The cast, the setting and the costumes are amazing. I knew Timmy as Wonka would be a good idea but the movie ended up being perfect. Every detail deserves special attention because they are wonderful. I recommend watching this film on the giant cinema screens, the experience is wonderful... And don't forget to eat chocolates❤"
"The movie was good, and his songs were even better. Crazy all the hate before it came out. I think it was brilliant personally."
Me and my niece enjoyed the movie ❤
what a bad choice for lead actor isnt he like 12
Someone see Mr bean😂
The police chief getting fatter was funny
"Another ""woke"" adaptation"
"My fiancé and I watched Wonka earlier today and it was really good. It was a well written and entertaining origin story about 1 of the greatest characters ever, Willy Wonka. The film actually pulled back the curtain and showed us why he fell in love with making chocolate. I recommend watching this film whether you’re a fan of Willy Wonka or not, especially if you have kids. This is a great film for the whole family to enjoy. In my opinion, it won’t ever top the 1971 Gene Wilder version. But it’s a close second and the 2005 version with Johnny Depp was a little too weird for me. Plus I don’t feel as if Charlie and the Chocolate Factory paid homage to the original. Wonka does that without taking away from its own identity. Do yourselves a favor and go see this film."
Saw it yesterday. Really disappointed. Wish I didnt waste the $ honestly.
"In the first movie, it showed Wonka getting braces as a kid... When does that come into Wonka's life here tho? hmmm"
this was insanely good. Such a fun movie!
so sick of reboot after reboot after reboot
A shame they got an actor who looks 13 years old to play the main character. That doesn’t align with the novel nor the original movie. Shame
This is the most epic Daniel Thrasher skit ever.
Just watched it! It was better than I thought it would be. With how movie quality and writing is regressing. I liked it. Took my little ones. Good times. If you have a bad attitude you probably won’t like it.
I bet you I will stay far away from every theater ever while this is playing
"This has zero feel of the classic and just a sad attempt to make something that's already epic, epic again. Except you're inauthentic and reaching for new age political  modernity instead of just writing a good movie."
I see Hollywood is still out of ideas...... 😐
"So, private companies hoarded the 'chocolate' and hated the poor, and used the religious institutions to hide the chocolate, and wouldn't let poor willy wonka make any chocolate by holding him down with regulations. The corporation then used the hoarded and hid chocolate by the church to bribe law enforcement to 'do away' with the competition. Every child should see this movie and remember it for when they are an adult."
I can hear the Mr. Bean in Rowan Atkinson
I know it’s PG movie but sometimes PG movies you can’t watch with young kids. Anyone that watched it can you advice if ok to watch with my 7 yrs old. Thanks in advance
Regular Movie
"I saw the movie with my mom while dad stayed home. I can only say this in short words. It was Magical, Musical and a truly was a world of Pure Imagination!!"
The best thing of this movie is Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean) 🎉
YOUVE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME! ANOTHER REMAKE?!?! WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU LAZY MOVIE PRODUCERS
hmm i will still watch it. I will try to look past the acting of Willy Wonka
Looks woke and lame. No thanks!
Looks to be loads better than the Johnny Depp version.
Very predictable and dragged on a LOT! Boring really…
Nobody wants this movie
Does Zelensky make a cameo?
"𝑻𝒊𝒎𝒐𝒕𝒉𝒆𝒆 𝑪𝒉𝒂𝒍𝒂𝒎𝒆𝒕. so li’l Timmy Tim has nailed it once again ladies and gentlemen!! What an amazing actor you are! ❤️❤️❤️This time you have proven that you are a great singer too! The songs were such a treat to the soul!! Tears of joy!! 
Wonka Movie It’s a magical adventure and you will indulge in this experience. Totally justified all Willy Wonkas from the past! No action, no romance, just pure bliss depicting innocent lives and their stories! Big fan of your work man!! You never fail to amaze!! 
Children will love this! For the first time ever, my 8 year old said “Great movie mom, I loved it!!🥰”"
What a heart-warming movie <3
cringe trash
"Disappointing.  A good 2/3 of the movie taken was up by the ""trapped in the laundry"" plot.   And what is the point or need to have all the oompa loompas being clones in the last 2 movies?  Too much of a musical.   It had it moments though.  I think the Johnny Depp movie was better overall."
"Dom was really good, impressed and I'm a hard character to impress."
It's not Wonka enough for me....
The actor don't compare with the last Waka film pfff
Looks absolutely atrocious. At least it's not a remake.
Didn't this movie come out like three years ago??
"the ""diversity"" killed it. there i said it."
every movie now has a token black
As long a it's nothing like that Johnny Depp travesty...
Gene wilder simply can’t be matched. Disney should have left it alone.
"I loved it! Whimsical and funny, I cried halfway through. I'm definitely going to take my friends sometime soon! Go watch it!"
Seems horrible.
Looks stupid. So overdone. This never beats the original classic.
"NOPE!!! Nothing close to the actual movie, This Producer needs to watch the original movie again."
"The wokesters made sure to have bIack people in every. single. scene. of the trailer, lol."
"""Here we go momma"""
"Best movies of Timothy’s for sure, I smiled , laughed and cried at the same time, everyone should go and see it ! Oh my gosh he can sing"
"2023 UK is 3% bIack, but apparently 100 or so years ago it was 60% bIack. Interesting."
Oh wow the acting really sucks in this trailer
IM READY TO WONK MY WILLY!!
Not gonna lie but the songs in this movie is lit and  addictive
Such a beautiful movie .. watched it todayy 🎉❤❤❤
Should have kept Johnny!
Just looks boring and another 2020 movie that nobody asked for or wanted
No one can replace johnny depp.......
I love this movie…. Finally something worth watching for
"I've been waiting for so long for Wonka to be live on cinema, but i hate it because Timothie talked in a disrespectful way about Palestine and underestimated the current situation in Gaza!"
This looks TERRIBLE.
"Wow, let's black wash a classic for woke fools. Another Hollywood failure."
finally i found paul atradeis here😂😂😂😂
This was so needed
"Loved the movie! It was so heartfelt, whimsical, uplifting, and funny."
If you have not already watched this show . It’s amazing how they made it
Not making me wanna see it.
This is not based on the original Wonka's yet they used the original song... We all know Wonka had a father who was a dentist but okay 🤦‍♀️
"looks bad, good luck"
WHAT ARE WE GONNA ZOO WILLY
"This movie was absolutely amazing and breathtaking!

It felt like I was watching a classic Disney animated film and the music was beautiful.

It was just perfect in my eyes, an absolute masterpiece"
Who’s here after seeing the movie opening night in 4DX? 🙋🏻‍♂️
Can't leave well enough aloe!!! I bet it is as stupid as the Johney Depp version.
GO SEE WONKA!!!!!  IT IS A AMAZING MOVIE!!!!
Jonny Depp is wonka ….
Needs more CGI !!!! 🥴
"i'm not that type that are watching movies, but all I could say after seeing this movie is that i ended up in tears, genuinely an incredible movie, i really really recommend watching it ❤"
"""Here we go momma""  :("
I'm kinda concerned because it looks and sound like a Disney live action. Is it good?
I going to see it tomz
Worst movie ever; don't wste your time
wtf is this trash
"Tbh, Timothee cant beat jhonny depp."
"what a fantastic movie, best one of this year"
Nobody beets Gene Wilder version
I watched it in cinema very nice 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
One of the worst films I have ever seen
Did I hear him right the chocolate cartel😳 ain’t no way 0:30 and 0:31.
This movie is very nice our school take as to show  this movie
Wokea
"I didn't wait and I didn't expect anything great, but what can I do if I really liked the movie. And what's more, this my second best picture of 2023. Simply pure magic movie
One of the greatest movies of all time
My favorite Wonka version
,,Huh, Huh a double huh"""
It's a musical.
Boring
This movie looks trash they get worse
Why???? lol
"It's interesting that they are completely ignoring the 2005 version and this is more of a prequel to the one from 1971 (although it has some differences). 
It even has a remix of _""Pure Imagination""_ and the actor who plays Wonka looks like a younger Gene Wilder."
1:25  THE MUSICC FROM HERE IS GREAT ❤❤❤❤❤
Spoiler Mr bean comes out good movie
Have our standers gotten so low we think this is good?
What an amazing movie! Just watched it in cinema and must say it went beyond my expectations 👍🏻
CGI as always horrendous
02:16??? hahaha...
I love grapes
di maganda yung movie 😔
Oh man - poor Timothy.  You can never follow Gene Wilder.
Looks amazing 👏
"It’s the day today !!
December 15 🎉"
Good for kids. But not in sync with the other Wonka movie that thus should happen in the future of this universe.
Stop putting black Girls in all of the movies.
Yeah Timothee knocks it out of the park with this. As does Hugh Grant. Hilarious and wholesome. Need to suspend some disbelief but all in all a really fun movie. 9.8/10
Can't wait to watch the full movie
waaaaaaaaaaaaack
"For the uneducated people calling this movie woke, woke means to be aware of social injustice. I see nothing wrong with this movie, if it was truly woke then wonk would have been a Female."
For he IS the Chocolate Haderach...
Aww good old diversity. Ruins everything.
"I just finished watching this movie and OMG. This was indeed one of my favorite movies of all time. This movie was an escape to all and everything that bad and horrible in this world. I was laughing and smiling throughout this film. I fell in love with all of the characters. The word I can describe this movie is MAGICAL. Timothee Chalamet needs to win some type of award for this masterpiece, and the movie itself too. I encourage everyone to see this movie. I hope you enjoy the best time the same that I did. 10/10❤"
WTF!? Who wants this garbage?
Just watched it... and it was awesome! 👍
Never been so uninterested in a movie trailer 😊
They should’ve used an actor that looks like a young Gene Wilder.
"OKI just got back from watching the show, and I actually thought it was pretty good person. I went with thought it was fair and there was only a few people there, so I don't know what that means maybe a lot of people just didn't want to go or they were still worked at the time all in all. I think it was pretty worth it. I wanted to see how it all started. And I like that that was pretty good.  Will there be a sequel? My hopes fall? You must stay until the end. There is some hidden credits but nothing that actually says that there's gonna be a sequel or not. I didn't stay for the whole thing past. The end of credits just the scenes that they wanted you to see again like I said I like that.  I give a thirteen out of thirteen skulls and I said check it out"
I'm not sure if I'm watching Wonka or Harry Potter on chocolate.
Lmao Mr beans actor  is there
THIS MOVIE IS BAD!!! 2/10
Harry potter theme
Willy Woka is sure to be a hit
this looks bad. lol
Hank likes this😅
I'm not watching any new movies... these stupid r3tards can't figure out how to MAKE NEW STUFF... YOU'RE PATHETIC FAILURES.
I am tired of seeing Timothee Chalamet in EVERYTHING.  Like my brain is just tired of his face invading every narrative.  It is nothing personal -- he is a fine actor.  But he is like corn -- do we need corn in everything?
"Just watch with 2 kids. Very nice movie. It has been a long time since i watched such a nice musical and positive storyline
All actors and actresses are fantastic, all with very nice vocal. ❤🎉❤❤❤"
"So... Hugh Grant stealing the scene (very funny), some nice effects and ... meh? Timothy's lines appear a bit flat for a larger than life character. There's no edge like the Gene Wilder version. I don't see any type of spark.... will check the next trailer for signs of life from the character."
not good at all boring and plain nothing to the original . This prequel was disappointing.
"There will never be Another remake better than the late   
Great and talented
Gene Wilder may he rest in Christ"
ALAN JOHNSON
Saw this last night ! It’s amazing ❤
watched it the other day and it was surprisingly good
But how does it explain why and how he gets his sadistic streak in Gene Wilder’s version? This version seems too goody two shoes.
The fact that they did the oompa loompas right makes this instantly better than the Johnny Depp one
finally a movie that feels long not just running in a fast pace.
My Ultimate Crush Timothee Chalamet
Fantastic movie!
"Great movie, just seen it today"
I saw mr Bean waw
"Thank you Warner Bros Team for making such type of feel good movies, me and my sister really very obsessed with these. The Shazam was also very great"
I'm surprised with how many great reviews it's getting
I'm watching this movie tonight!
Am glad they found the perfect actor to play WW! Yay Can't wait!!!
saw it and it was great!
Nope.
El soldado chamamé actúa de Willy Wonka
This looks terrible
Saw it on cinema last night. It was the best film I've watched this 2023.
One of THE BEST MOVIES 2023
"niente, questi sono capaci di fare un film su papa woetyla e farlo ""africano"" e sappiamo bene perché, che cringiata schifosa, #GetWokeGoBroke"
I think Chalamet wasn't the best choice
What is Mr Chalamet's acting exactly?
"The end got me, I was in tears"
Tired of all the original movies being redone.  My family is never going to watch this movie.  Leave the originals alone please..  👎👎
I’m actually excited to see this we’ll see if it lives up to gene wilder.
pie....es.
this movie sucks
"Love that it feels like the original, unlike the Depp version"
Holy botted comments
Way to ruin an original.
Im sorry but isn’t willy wonka set in 1800s and its looks like 1800 britain and wasn’t it mostly white rich people the 1971 movie all white people and same as 2005 so why is it now ?
Did they seriously replace Charlie with a black female? No hope left for movies..
This version honestly does not seem interesting or entertaining. Just by seeing the trailer I can already tell Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) is much better. Movies now a days are way too flashy which ruins the subject and story. Tone it down.
Looks shite
You just kill it every time. The best. Always.
"I love Timothee Chalamet, but I always thought Rob Schneider would have played a perfect Wonka too!"
The actor who plays Wonka has no charisma or charm. Wooden.
flop
cringe! they just hired timmy chamelet becuase hes popular to teen girls
Just watched the movie 🥹 heads off to the one of the best musicals after the first enchanted
"I didn’t read anything bout it so I was expecting a remake. Pleasantly surprised to discover an origin story that was so well told. One of the most magical & special experiences in cinema history, up there with the best of musical comedy genre. Gotta hand it to WB for allowing it to be made and for avoiding wokeism. They just focused on magic, hope, creativity, imagination, friendship, mother-child bond, toughness and cruelty of the world out there, overcoming adversity; universal themes that people of any race can relate to."
"I saw the movie yesterday, I hate musicals, but that was the most wonderful musical movie I've ever seen, the acting of thimothéé remembered me about hatter of Alice, it was a good experience"
"Ahhhh yes, nothing like not hiring a dwarf to play a oompa loompa but you can just CGI Hugh Grant  on a tiny body and that's totally fine, wouldn't wanna offend anybody!!"
"watched it with my girlfriend and since it's my first time watching in cinema, it's the best things I've seen"
In some days I'm going to the cinema to wach it !!!
I honestly never thought I would ever see a remake close to my favourite childhood film with Gene Wilder but this is absolute delight the ending actually brought a tear to my eye and transformed me back to that kid I've nearly forgot bravo.
"Great movie where my family enjoyed it. The dancing scene on the roof after getting the milk, the flamingo flying,  the balloon etc shown a serious production that was worthy for cinema tickets. Well done !"
"If you liked Wonka , check these out:
1. Hoodwinked Too! Hood vs. Evil (2011 film)
2. Ducktales 2017 (2017 series)
3. The Tale of Despereaux (2008 film)
4. The Forgotten Valley 2022 (2022 series)
5. Norbit (2007 film)
...

"This looks so bad that people are remembering the Depp remake fondly, and that remake was bad too. 

Oh Hollywood."
"I've always wanted to see Willy Wonka help a poor POC, and I just wanted them to admit that willy wonkas chocolate factory was mostly built by a chocolate girl!

NOOOOOOOOT! NEXT!"
Wonka look like Billie Joe Armstrong (greenday)
"Garbage!
Next one?"
Kapan kapan di tayangin di youtube yang fullnya biar banyak yang nonton
"Hollywood is destroying movies by only adding one colour main characters these days…. It’s ridiculous that the woke left have destroyed, so many movies in the past few years."
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE IT😊😊😊😊😊❤❤❤❤
bloop
Terrible choice in casting this guy as willy..Kids is to wholesome...Gene and Johnny perfect for the role...This is woke willy and I'll pass
❤❤❤❤❤❤
"This has none of the charm, camp, or whimsy of the original. Just another fantastic display of CGI and mediocre actors"
Hollywood disappointing as always.
The chocolate  Cartels 😂
Nothing will ever compare to the 1971 version nothing
"There will only be one, and Gene Wilder was the lead..."
i just watched the movie i love it it made me laugh and it made me cry
"Casting a Jew in the lead role, this is not wonky but a movie about the UN diversity 

that’s going to fill seats"
"Is it a musical? Or just have multiple looking music numbers?
Either way this is NOT WILLY WONKA"
I think I love the original to much to want to watch this.  Even as an old adult he was still working on the fizzy lifting drink. This young Wonka has way more confidence then the old Wonka.
looks fantastically unappealing...
I would love for them to eventually do a sequel with Charlie running it to see how it turned out
looks like a load of woke rubbish
Timothee supports Israel so we won't be watching
Is Willy wonka a graduate of hogwarts I need to known that Warner bros
Is Willy wonka a graduate of hogwarts
Wtf
Just watched absolutely brilliant a must see
How on earth did i never see this trailer for the passed 5 months?  And it's this month?  I'm sold.
Then 30 years later he gives his factory to a child and his suspicious grandfather he knew for less then a day
1:07
"Ha! Wonderful casting. The kid from Call Me by my Name. Truly a beautiful man, like the actor in Death in Venice!"
"Finally an actual marvellous remake of a famous classic, unlike some that just copy the entirety of the original in a horrible way..."
Forced and weakly derivative
Wonka looks like a normal person. Not a creep
Johnny Depp was brilliant
Chalemet is too flat
"I love the part where Wonka said ""Its wonking time"" and proceeded to Wonk all over the place"
"I have an idea!!!   How about making a movie that hasn’t been made before!!!  Oh no, that will take some ingenuity…."
Yawn! Not..
That part: for his mom 😢❤
Nee dit is niet goed. Het moet een mysterie blijven...
This looks FIRE
Una  abrerracion pero la vere
im going to watch it on thursday with my school!
Can’t believe they recast an anxious fiery skinny little white boy with a fat cheeky little black girl
"So many blacks, ugh"
"The film was released here in Brazil and I admit, it was the most beautiful film I've ever seen.  I never liked musicals, but this one exceeded all my expectations, I simply left the cinema crying, influenced by its magic."
Garbage…
"I honestly think this is going to be a bust... It doesnt have the same feel, cinematography, or pizzaz the original movie, or even the sequel had.. I don't think woke is the word, but it looks far too ""song and dance"" or show boaty in a bad way.. Almost like it's forced. The original Wonka movie stayed in the realm of reality, what could actually possibly be, with few exceptions here and there relating to his inventions... this is just outlandish."
i watched this today and it was so so good. considering seeing it again soon 😅
After his comments he made no thank you
He supports genocide no thank you
Ooh look diversity hires
Diversity Inclusion & Equity!
Gran película
Timothée Chalamet is perfect to play Wonka.
Slugworth is not black.
Exelente producción muy interesante
"Se mira una película muy interesante, con bastante historia y trama, ya quiero ir a verla❤"
Another cash grab by WB. We don’t need another Willy Wonka remake. The Gene Wilder version was and always will be the definitive Willy Wonka.
Mui buena

OK... THIS LOOKS STUPID
"Really sick of continual 'sequels'.  Stick with the originals - far, far better."
The story was ok. The  constant singing every 5 minutes made this incredibly annoying.
needs acting classes

Im glad they didnt spoil the Snow Piercer train in the trailer.
This movie is amazing trust me! Just watched it yesterday at the cinema
"Not my cup of tea. I like the quirkyness of Johnny Depps Wonka.

This one just seems like another musical movie. And it's not the greatest showman."
"I was so ready to hate this movie. I've seen both movies as a kid more times than I could count, read the book so many times. But dang it I came out of this movie with a huge smile on my face, the music was so much fun, the choreography felt like a giant broadway show. There are so many great surprises in this movie if you go in completely blind. I'd say this comes closer to Roal Dahl's original text in spirit than the previous movies. They had this weird sense of darkness that I attribute to the filmmakers, the book had zany moments but never felt psycho. This felt like  warm Christmas hug, like an old VHS tape you discovered on the attic on a rainy afternoon."
I hate oompa loopa design
Carryminati🌚
It looks delightful! Can't wait to see it.
I love it ❤❤❤
I'm from India this is the first English movie I watched in big screen ( theatre) this movie is so good I really like this movie

Johnny Depp was the best but I don't think this is bad

Where is his 'dentist father'?

"Looks utterly soulless and unimaginative, Hollywood continues to mine nostalgia because they have no original ideas"
So this is the story of Willy Wonka rather than how he gave the factory to Charlie. YAY !
wtf happened to hollywood did they all quit cocaine at the same time
This is going to turn into a trilogy
Is Timothee Chalomet trying to set a record for number of times starring in the 3rd remake of a movie?
Why not make Wonka black too? 🙄
My favourite Movie was 'Charlie and the chocolate factory ' how jonny dep make the factory it was mystery for me now it willbe clear 😇
"Forgive me for this but
Why does the guy in the yellow suit looks like a British blonde version of Hitler"
Without Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp Will the Real Mystical Fantasy take One Into Illuminations of Imaginations and Beyond
"The Gene Wilder original is a huge part of my childhood and I will always love it. That said, I'm looking forward to this one. Plan to go see it Christmas Day. It looks delightful."
This makes me so happy. I never thought this role could be so perfect for timothee chalamet. He is a really good actor. Ive always love ww and the cf .  And to think hugh grant and rowan a Makes this so much better❤️🥰🥰 i am watching it this week and i cant wait for it
The auto tune in the songs is serving on a whole new level
"I watched this a few nights ago, I wasn't impressed"
"It looks like trash and has no charm.
Tim Burton's version wasn't as good but it's still a serviceable film.
The original 1971 version still reigns supreme."
Ok so only just watched this film today and I have too say I was surprised with how good the movie is everyone is on point in this film.
Could never be better than Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka.
This looks awful.
Guarantee it's going to be woke garbage. I'll bet on it.
"Hmmm sorry, Depp did it better."
I watched this movie today it’s pretty good I can’t wait for the squeal of it has one also the oompa loopas are the best
"The 3rd remake of a film. You don’t see that quite often. 


It seems like they have totally changed the story of Willy wonka and it’s more about how he got started etc. for the young ones it will be cool and magical. For the older ones I feel like it ruins it and I will never beat the classics. But imo it does look good"
Missing Johnny......missing umpha lumpha....missing the whole factory
"Watched this movie today, it was magnificent"
Where the f is Johnny depp
"Napanood ko kanina sa cinema, anganda nya sobra. Nakakatawa sya tas maganda rin ung mga kanta, great din ung acting 😔 need ko irewatch- 8.5/10 kase di ko masyado kita ung screen malabo mata ko eh... pero oks lng 9/10 final rate ko (5 minutes late kami kaya di namin napanood ung intro?)"
Too many blacks as usual
I’m used to seeing an older Willy wonka
Shank ❤
I really liked it! ❤
Why? What do they want to tell differently? The old movie still make sense and looks good.
The film was amazing🎉
Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka for me ❤️
Willie Wonkas kid got a dark suntan and  needs a haircut
I saw the movie and it was sick!!
"Done watching it... Its so so so good 💯💯 Best of all the movie I saw worth the price 
Super love all the song it makes me cry 😍😍😭"
"I'm kind of glad this was a British telling, American movies today have a way of creating a heavily editing, flashy, superficial spectacle which ultimately falls flat and is soulless, the British are better storytellers, with more nuances and romanticism in a movie like this"
Willy Woka
"I just saw it, it was great! I didn’t expect anything, I just sat there and watched. I left the cinema full of positivity and joy! Don’t compare and give this movie a chance 💛

P.S. Timmy’s a theater actor before he became a hollywood star. Spoiler: He did an incredible job 👌"
Winter feel good film..go see ! I ignored the negative reviews and took the kids..we all were totally absorbed! 🍿🍫🎬
Cash grab for all the Chalamet thirsting fans 🙄
Awesome
"Hmmm, well... the shots look nice, it seems whimsical, and Timothée is hot. Hoping it's decent enough so I can enjoy the pretty scenery and ogle the leading lad. 🤷‍♀"
Is this related to the Depp one? I think the continuity is distorted. Unless this is the wonkaverse
"Just stop. Nobody asked for this. The original is a classic. It does not need to be remade, again, with another half assed CGI slop fest."
this looks horrible
This looks really dumb
Homunculus
No one can replace Jhonny Depp 😊
I will go to cinema monte carlo next days
Deeply political virtue signaling atrocity. As if they hadn’t ruined it enough with the Johnny Depp version. It’s propaganda at its worst.
"This movie is magic, can make us happy!"
"Just got back from seeing this with boyfriends kid and he asked to leave half way through, so much singing. Story line dragged. But hugh grant as an oompa loompa redeemed it slightly but not enough for us to bother to stay til the end"
"I'll take the original with Gene Wilder any day, and my mind will never change on this. It might be old but it's timeless for me! Johnny Depp wasn't Willy Wonka enough, and neither is Chalamet .. sorry! I think they cast Grant well though, but won't be enough for me to see this film .. sorry!"
"Creatively bankrupt, rehashed and unoriginal garbage."
I rather take my kids to PORORO Star Adventure.
This looks like trash hopefully it’s a big ol flop.
"The ompa lompa looks awful 😂 I dunno if I'd watch it, I think I'd be too bored."
This movie looks truly terrible.
"Anyways Johnny depp mastered the witty , sarcastic wonka s character better . He was perfect ❤"
"Woke joke.  All the oompa loompas are now non binary, climate activists."
Saw this yesterday.  This is the family musical we all need.  Very highly recommended for bonding with the kids.  Will give everyone a great shot of joy this Holiday Season🌲 Truly a magical moment of “Pure Imagination”.
"I liked the part where he said ""it's wonkering time"" and then wonkered all over augustus gloop."
I will watch today at cinema.. Very curious about it. …
ROWAN ATKINSON!!!
"I sounds bit odd. Cuz chocolate fuctory was actually realistic in some way. There were so many unreal things but based on the premises weired things(not not entirely impossible things) existing, whole things were sarcastically depicting the reality. But this thig looks like magic involved. It's more like watching Alice movies."
just another loser pedo remake.
"Saw the ad on TV, got keen. Saw the trailer. I probably won't watch this. Seems too harry potter, magical non sense. The original(the best) feels much, MUCH more authentic. Almost like everything there is possible. Gene Wilder didn't act as Willy Wonka, he was Willy Wonka. This kid doesn't have the same, natural energy."
Timothée is so sweet❤❤
"Most would consider this movie unnecessary and a cash grab. My sister, mother and I absolutely loved this movie even if nobody asked for it to be made. Highly recommend."
I got an Italian ad so I thought it's Italian until I realised that it's this man lol
"Saw it last night with my grand children, all in total agreement. Probably one of the worst films ever made. The trouble was they'd watched the real 1971 film last year. 😝"
"Call me a psychopath







But I’m actually looking forward to this movie"
"""Too late, I've started dancing now"" lol"
Why did I randomly have a dream including Timothe Chalamet last night? I hadn't even seen the trailer or knew who he was in delth. Did they pay for this advertisin?
Willy Wonka had a sinister side which was important to the story.  There doesn't appear to exist that side in this version.
Why they have to cast that stupid Chalamet seriously that pissy girly boy’s acting is soooooooooooooooo bad
Oh yay another woke pos from the sewage pile that is the collective hive mind of woke writers
There’s nothing original anymore
Did u know the actor of mr bean is there? He is the priest for the church
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fun fact: This would be the first movie to use the new WB on-screen logo

Again the black society live off the back of “white privilege” they can’t even come up with their own idea they have to use an English white classic to be part off!
the movie was very funny 10/10
See Warner brothers not selling out like Disney. If this was a Disney film willy wonka would have been black.
woke filth as usual.
Literally Timothee's worst movie and a genuinely bad overall movie
Oomph loompa
"I feel like they remake this every few years, wasn't there a film of this made only a few years ago with Johnny Depp? And one before that with Gene Wilder which was great and didn't need a remake."
Creatively bankrupt much? This Wonka has zero charisma and wtf with all the black people? Please tell me that an extremely advanced AI just spits these movies out nowadays..
There weren't so many blacks in Europe back then... I guess Hollywood is not into making realistic movies anymore...
I'd say its gonna be shite
As a 90s baby I'm upset with this lol 😅
i really wish this wasn't a thing. Great actor mediocre idea
Nothing better than depp version
Wow this looks generic and completely different story to the original.
Suddenly in 2023 all these black characters magically appear. Funny how the comments are turned off the UK Ireland version of the trailer. Seeing English period pieces with a bunch of black characters looks so fake and ridiculous.
Was bit of a let down   but stil ok I spouse 6 out 10
That movie was soo boring. I don’t like the character that plays Wonka. I don’t feel that same excitement and thrill has the previous Willy Wonka movies
Looks woke I'm out
I can't believe my uncle worked in this Hollywood movie ❤
Gene Wilder must be rolling in his ditch...
"With the Must have PC Thrown up , could be the Jammy Sours!😂😂😂"
Just saw the movie timothee blew my exoectations!
"It looks as generic as a commercialised Xmas ..
Zzzzzz😮
Just watch the original!"
"Now I been slowly getting into Willy Wonka again watching both the 1971 and 2005 movies… and like I will say that I am excited but also nervous… because this has so much potential and I do like what I see in the trailer just afraid Hollywood has not learned their lesson of changing classic tales but I like to stay optimistic… I feel like Chalamet’s performance is fine from what we see in the trailer and I feel like many are way to quick to jump to conclusions before the movie is even released… I obviously don’t think he can like past the acting that Gene wilder did but I mean since they seem to at least from a design standpoint mimic the 1971 version I can keep my hopes up that we get this more charming tone that Wilder Wonka has compared to Depp Wonka…. Feel like we should wait until the movie comes cause we are all a little too quick to jump to conclusions… and while sure he doesn’t appear as weird or quirky as Gene wilders portrayal guess it’s important to keep in mind that this is before Wonka closed his factory and isolated himself which I definitely feel like has a part in why the man appears like he is in his own head at times in all depictions really…

So I am excited, a little nervous but optimistic… but best of all they did not give him the ugly bowl cut thing they gave Depp- and that is the best thing of all💀😅"
i miss johnny deep..he was my forever willi wonka...the best acting ever ever and forever
"Please, not another Wonka movie. Why can writers nowadays not write new stories. No imagination any more"
"How do you like your people dark,white and nutty"
It looks like a forced version of this story. Gene Wilder movie was brilliant; Tim Burton's was not bad but without the magic of the first film; this one looks like the weakest version. Chalamet is not prepared yet to be Willy Wonka.
Doesn't look so good to me...
This looks good. I'm wondering if Gene Wilder would have liked it? RIP GW.
I don’t think I’m interested.
❤
Bro what is this shite
The best Willy Wonka is Johnny Depp hands down still fresh in my head like it came out yesterday
They looks way better than that garbage remake with Tim Burton I wish they had a tribute to gene wilder
Did the country really need another wonka movie? Hollywood is totally incapable of doing anything original these days.

Can't wait to see his origin story and learn what drove him to sugar murder children for funsies. 🤭
You know what they should do put tickets for the movie theater in the chocolate bars
ONE WORD describes it in french 'LINGUEE'
I thought this was a remake. Its an origin story. I like that.
"It is so difficult to top Willy Wonka 1971.  A film like this one, a remake, can make or break an actor.  I hope they were well paid just in case."
Bro sounds like Mark Rover💀💀💀💀
What is this??
This looks terrible 😮
Everywhere in the uk it’s dec 8
YUHHH SO GOOD
Boycott!
"Nope, won't be going to see this version as it doesn't even come close to previous Wonka movies"
what an embarrassment.
Jonny depp ❤
They need to stop remaking stuff and have there own  imagination
Making funny of H4m4S ? Sure this trash movie will be our Boycott list 👎🏻⛔🚫
This is just awful. Focusing on wonka also shows you didn't actually read any of the books.
All we need is a wonka video game
Looks bad.
Lol more woke garbage. Lmao even
I’m seeing this tomorrow looks great
"im interested in how this movie will end tbh. or i guess the 2nd half of the film, i wonder if we'll see the change in Wonka from his seemingly optimistic self in this trailer to who he was in the original."
"1:52 The delivery of that line is awesome. I think this is gonna be a good movie
EDIT: some friends and I went and watched it. Let me say it was absolutely perfect. It combined emotion and comedy perfectly. It was hilarious. SPOILER: At the end when he started to sing the original song from the original movie it really just perfected the movie. 10/10"
Please tell me he sings it.
"Please don't be woke, please don't be woke. 🤞🏻"
"Looks woke , black girl and dwarfs out of the job again"
Omg
this looks awful its supposed to be about horrible children not horrible adults
No.
a trash movie with a trash leading actor
Imagine if they got Lip from shameless to be wonka! Movie looks great but not a big fan of the main actor
Chocolate makes you happy but watching this movie making you free from all the problems.
"I can’t, I WON’T accept him as Wonka 🧐It will always be Gene Wilder and then Johnny Depp. No one else."
1:41 anyone else hearing Mr. Bean there?
He reminds me of scott dissick
"The resounding drums, triumphant brass, and sweeping strings of epic music inject movie trailers with a profoundly thrilling ambience. This style of bold, operatic composition brings an unmatched sense of grandeur. The full symphonic sound washes over you, instant goosebumps as that exhilarating melody unfurls. No words are needed to feel the mood - whether tensions simmering into war cries or heroes rising against the odds to turn the tide. The music amplifies the high stakes hinted onscreen into palpable excitement. These epic anthems punctuate trailers with exclamation points, ensuring the adventure ahead leaves an indelible impression whether it features clashing armies or character-driven drama. The marriage of epic music's unrelenting crescendo and carefully edited visuals forms a siren song, drawing us right into imagined new worlds brimming with action, emotion and spectacle. Who can resist such powerful musical storytelling, the ultimate appetizer promising grand purpose behind these tales? We have those ingenious sound composers to thank for trailers that spark such strong senses of destiny through their triumphant symphonic suites alone - our hearts quicken and imaginations ignite."
"🤣🤣🤣 1:42 ""Run awayyyyy *fades* idk why but that part got me"
"he seems a little too clean for a whimsical and brilliant, yet crazed and unempathetic entrepreneur"
Looks very…… inclusive
"One detail this film gets wrong: in the book when Willy Wonka first started his business he had ordinary human workers working in his factory. Then his rival chocolate makers started hiring spies to work in his factory and then give the secrets of his special chocolates to them. It was only after that happened that Wonka traveled to the land of the Oompa-Loompas and had them take their place as his new workers. This movie is supposed to be about young Wonka when he's just starting out as a professional chocolate maker, so this should be before he meets the Oompa-Loompas.🙃"
y los Oompa Loompa?
W ❤gf 23 w t m o dkaa dkasad
Rowan Atkinson is going to be funny as always in the film
"It's much easier to make a good trailer than a good movie. If the trailer is this bad, the movie will be worse than a combination root canal and colonoscopy."
Gene Wilder was brilliant and charismatic. Johnny Depp was creepy and seemed to be a pedophile. This new guy is a little fruit.
terrible
"Of course, there has to be a black kid."
Dawg just watch the original
Why was this necessary? Sighhhh...
So before he became bitter and lonely and gave up the factory? Yall just make anything
It’s a story set in England before the third world invaded. Why are there all these token people in this movie?
o wow.  the evil capitlists are preventing Willy Wonka from becoming a capitalist!!!  the horror.
Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa is wild
ya ampun it's fcking timothy chalamet
It's so good that I want to watch second time!!!!!

"(warning: contains spoilers)
Spectacular production, wonderful casting and a fantastic soundtrack to boot. I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances, and there's a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family. Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka (2023), I did not have much to go on. I was also a tad skeptical if I would enjoy it as much as I had enjoyed Johnny Depp's and Gene Wilder's performances of Willy Wonka prior to this movie.  But it's the holidays, I had a day out with my niece, and this was premiering, so we got the tickets. And I was not to be disappointed.

<spoiler>
From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and cane-twirling sequences, Timothee Chalamet's whimsical performance gives nods to both Depp's and Wilder's earlier depictions of Wonka, while still adding his own spin and spice (and all things nice) to the young Wonka he plays.

There is a purity and crispness in Chalamet's delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth, despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him. And this is key because it carries over into his later years, and it is the re-imagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again.

Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa, who delivers his lines in perfect matter-of-fact British fashion. My niece liked his performance so much, she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home, while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead. 
</spoiler>

If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones, this should be it! And would I watch it again? Oh, ABSOLUTELY!"

"Timothée Chalamet isn't quirky enough to play Wonka, even in the trailer all his lines are falling flat. I know Depp is subject to a lot of controversy, and say what you will, but he was amazing at playing Wonka. He nailed it. 
And Gene Wilder is the master of weird, of course, so no need to point out that he did a great job."
"Who is this movie for? Yeah, like People in 2023 really want to see a Willy wonka movie. Another very out of touch move"
"*WB W0nka*
*Budget $125 M*
*1 hour 56 minutes*

*J0hnny was fired by WB fantastic beast Grindelwald*"

How can you not love Timothy Charlemagne he is my favorite actor
Woke bs?
Timothée Chalamet isn't quite deadpan or awkward enough to portray Wonka...hmmm.
"So is it going to be a thing that a little person wasn't used for what's traditionally a little person role, or is them making  Hugh grant a little person through cgi going to be the thing? Idk, but something about it is going to be a thing."

An American WIlly Wonka...   Now I know the world is coming to an end!
This guy is a terrible actor Hollywood must be having their way with him
Always have to ruin a good thing
should of just called it woka
Tim is such such such such SUCH a bad actor
Im not sure about this film. Im sorry theres only one Willy Wonka to me and thats Gene Wilder. Everytime they bring out a film it just doesn't compare to the original.
No Johnny Depp?! Who greenlit this.
Do you spot any similarity with King Charles III? A popularity booster for the Monarch.
"Social Engineering Propaganda: ""The Future Will Be Chocolate"".
I say MORE MILK."
Everything about this movie from the concept to the team behind it is amazing except Chalamet. Hes just not Wonka... He seems more like an edgy teen wanting to put a vampire diaries spin on it...
Omg they just keep ruining the classics because this looks awful
Please Dubbed the telugu language
No! No! No! Leave it alone. Let it go. Smh

"Gene Wilder will forever be the best.

This smells of ""Woke'nka"""
Y’all just gotta keep ruining our classics huh? Please. Just stop. 😩
I guess the best way to keep a classic alive for generations is to make it relevant. I hope Timothee Chalamet can live up to the role.
Oh look they needed an excuse to put a black kid in Willy Wonka 🤪
Thanks for posting
This looks horrible
This is not the role for young master Timothee... 🤦🏻🙈
"Yeah man, I don't know."
I like Chalamet's version of the character he made Wonka jovial and likeable not a creepy weirdo like Johnny Depp did.
i still think nothing will beat the original willy wonka Jean wilder
"Like we need ANOTHER movie of this subject. Gene wilder nailed it the first time. Depp creeped it out. 
Yeesh"
When does that movie come out
"These Wonka movies just get worse,just a few months ago  Chalamet was a dressed up in a red backless outfit and now he is trying to play Wonka."
"Not gonna lie, beating Gene Wilder's Wonka is always going to be a steep uphill battle and this is no different. Something about this Wonka doesn't feel right."
"What? A black female main character in the cast?!?! How stunning, brave, and original!! Nobody has ever thought to remake a movie doing that!!!"
Good to see Snowpiercer has prequel now
I think I know what feels off. That actor is too young looking/sounding. Like it’s completely unbelievable. I get that the premise of this movie is already unbelievable but this really adds to it and makes it feel like a student film or something
I noticed there's a European man still playing the lead. Jaw hit's ground!
Y'all that are hating a movie which isn't premiering in a couple of days are acting like children.
I guess it's a good film to stay at home watching the classics
Another sequel......  Hollywood is basically saying youre stupid.  Very few original ideas.   Im boycotting hollywood indefinetly
Hope she knows she’s a fetish and guys are saying what they think she wants to hear. I love thick as long as there is a shape there. Not if you look like the girl who turned into a blueberry in Willy wonka
"I dont like the look of this, too Magicky, Harry Pottery,cgi-ey etc. I like Chalamet and feel a more grounded, story-driven, less effects laden film would work really well. Ita a shame because the young Wonka is such a good idea for a film."
absolutely LOVED with a capital L this trailer 😅😆.
Damn this cgi...
Mr Bean
Look another box office flop origin story. Hollywood is so creativity bankrupt all they can do is prey on established properties and destroy them in the process. Gene Wilder was a treasure and to think some low charisma hack like chalamet can fill that top hat....good luck.
Someone vote for Mr. Bean 😂❤
Why dose sound like nardward
Hollywood is over 🤮🤮🤮
No
In 1:01 mr.bean is now in the Wonka movie!
This wasn’t in the book……
His father was Saruman ( Christopher Lee). No wonder Wonka has some magic.
I was 100% expecting to hear his British accent  😭
I really hope it will be good
🗑
Why are there so many over the top positive spanish comments? How much did they pay for fake reviews? 😂
Timothy Chalamet is the worst choice for this role 🤦‍♂️ overhyped actor
Stop remaking these fukking movies u fuktards
WTf is this
Looks dreadful
should I watch it?
The colors seem off and dark
"This looks like The Polar Express as a live action, I am so excited, and the music score for the trailer literally brings tears to my eyes every time!! 🍭"
why is charlie a black girl? what are they trying to prove?!
The issue for me is that I don't see Willy Wonka I see TImothee Chalamet just winging it and acting like himself.
Wow Seems like a steaming pile of garbage.
Is this Willy Wonka gone woke??
"I’m sorry I don’t like that actor he just feels too normal like you know it’s a person acting and you don’t feel the character, in dune same way everyone had accents he had a normal American accent like what"
How about we get EHRMANTRAUT next year 🤡🤡
I still think the 2005 version is better
Looks fun!

Great cast but 🤢 Why can’t they just leave a Classic alone. Surprised that Wonker wasn’t a diverse woman this time 🙄
"why there are black people ? There were no black people in Europe at that time , looks like a boring movie"
Most awaited movie❤️🤌 can't wait for this movie release♥️♥️♥️♥️♥️!!!!!!
I need to catch up on my sleep. This movie looks perfect!
I enjoy him as an actor but I always picture Jeremey Allen White aka Lip Gallagher playing this role even before this movie was thought of. 😂
Yey
Looks like another bad take on a classic. And it’s a starts with Timothy Chalamets bland monotone performance that is already apparent in the trailers. Made for the box office to hopefully bring in millions and fade away but will never get close to the original in terms of classics
Chocolate movie
NOPE! Cancel this immediately before it bombs.
More like Willy Woke-a.
Twinky twonka
ruined a classic ... lost the real feeling of movies
Why tell the same story again and again ? We already know what happens
Too bad Gene Wilder isn't around anymore to make a cameo.
That movie aint gonna hit i seen to many remakes of movies which proves that the studios making it arent coming up with with original ideas any more and making remaking the same movies with shoddy quality which removes what made the movie special in the first place and also wonka sounds alot like mark rober
St Albans changed into winter land for a few  days is my best memory and seeing actors in the morning drinkingcoffeec
Why the F are they remaking this yet again? No one asked for it
"Who needed this?  If you didn't like Gene Wilder, you had Johnny Depp & vice versa.  Like we don't have enough woke trash remakes."
"Oh good, another woke remake that destroys the original story.  Yay."
Should’ve left it at Johnny Depp because wtf 😂.
"Hollywood: ""New ideas? Original stories?""
""Get outta my office !!!!!!"""
Love how everyone is banging on about the original being best without having seen this despite the fact it is not even a remake. Lots of Brits in the cast will make this EPIC!
Why does every movie that has come out in the last year have African Americans as co starts and supporting actors? I’m seeing a trend.
It looks great
This looks so stupid
This looks horrible
Looks like a watchable film.
This movie looks ok so far but don’t even think about watching it unless you’ve seen the original 1971 Willy Wonka 🍭
"With El0n telling Disney to feck off! Wonder what'll happen to Warner Bros etc once Peezagate become common knowledge? 

Happy to repost EACH time you delete this comment, boobtube."
omfg i legit thought this was aidan ghallagher this whole time turns out it was the guy who played dune 💀
"I think Chalamet's great, but Depp, much like he did with Captain Jack Sparrow, really brought a certain _""Je ne said quoi""_ to the Willie Wonka role, and that's gonna be hard to top."
Boy cott
Rowan Atkinson should have played Wonka! What a missed opportunity…I have feeling he has a bit part and the rest is garbage.
Will this movie not be released in Indian theatre in Hindi language ? Because I am a big fan of Sir Rowan Atkinson & Timothée Chalamet's acting ❤️
Жопка😂
Надо было Тимоти добавить немного странного мейкапа он слишком обычный. Джонни Депп более поехавший (судя по тому что влюбился в Эмбер) оттого он тянул эту роль.
"What a woke load of nonsense 😮
I would be more worried about being robbed"
They Casted the most goodie too shoe person ever to play as wonka
This looks terrible. Hollywood trying to extend the list of classic characters and IPs they destroy I see.
Glad i watched this trailer otherwise wld be a waste of time.. Unoriginal n suprises that turned disappointmemt.
This actually looks magical compared to a lot of new movies
Why do I feel like disney ruined it.
this looks really really bad
"Looks really good, but Gene Wilder will forever be Willy Wonka! 😉"
Discover how Sherman became WONKA
Willy Wonka is only Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp!!
looks as creepy as the other 2 films. I'm sure woke as well. Pass
"Hugh Grant as a badly animated Oompa Lumpa is the worst, most annoying thing I've seen since the She-Hulk trailer. I want to vomit."
This is the first Willy Wonka I find attractive.
"There is only one Willy Wonka and he is Gene Wilder (R.I.P.), sorry bus this Chalamet guy is not goog enough for the role!"
Jesus another one? Of course I'm gonna watch at some point in my life. Am i gonna watch it in theaters? No. Does it look bad? Yes.
Heard of new willy wonka movie and am very disappointed to see chalomet
Yay another woke piece of garbage
We need old Wonka back
"This is how you destroy the wonka universe... worst pick as main character, worst script... damn... just sad"
"This lacks the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary. Also, this Wonka isn't wonky. Pass."
It looks like a Wonderful Fantasy Christmas movie 🎉🎉🎉 about time😊
Mr bean!!
"GRACIAS A DIOS QUE DISNEY NO METIO SUS ASQUEROSAS MANOS WOKE, EN ESTA OBRA, POR RESPETO A LOS NIÑOS Y A LO ESTABLECIDO..."
I wonder where the American's love of the Irish people is now the Irish way of life is in trouble again.
"Charlie and the chocolate factory was one of my favorites movies. Rip to Both Grandpa & Grandma Joe & Josephine, George & Georgina"
This was filmed in WonkaVision.
Willy wonka and black girl 😂
Hes got the structure but not the voice. Its not his fault. Its extremely hard to follow up the true original.
They should have just stopped with the Johnny Depp Willy wonka 🤦‍♂️
"I have never beem a fan of any Wonka movie but this preview reminds me of Mary Poppins. It does not look bad,  just the feel of the movie makes me feel this.  Or maybe a Harry Potters movie but it reminds me of something from the past."
Going to be highly cringeworthy
Isn't Timothee's Wonka just Daniel Thrasher?
"Just played as him in Lies of P, and now he’s Wonka. It’s a good year."
Looks nothing like the first movie. Diversity trash.
I don’t think he’s fit to play wonka tbh he seems dull
Wow..jonny deep
He’s way too flat and buttoned up for this role. Needs some crack head energy. And the oompa loompa doesn’t make any sense at all ugh this sucks
So quite up and listen down
None of them beat the original version
"Sorry it looks pants, ticking all the politically correct boxes...well, apart from not using a real person of short stature for the oompa lumpa.
Willy looks about 10. 😏"
Who  wants to go with me to the cinema and obviously to watch it.😊
another knock off gene wilder is the only one for me
Wonka The Movie Sponsors Boomerang
But does he sing?
Woke version
do palestinian can dream the freedom too?
Boycott this man supports genocide of Palestinians!!!
Wonka the beginning
"Johnson, Alan Johnson."
👍
I guarantee you they're gonna make Wonka the twist villain
"Wow, how beautiful 😍❤️ It's great to see that the UK used to be so diverse in the olden days. Good thing there are films like this to teach us about how things used to be and to remind us how hiøorrible we have become in modern times where marginalized people have no freedom and women aren't allowed to participate in society ...or something 😂 go ESG!! (*sarcasm)"
If I were to watch a cinematic display of Wakanda I would no expect to see a bright person.
I think the character is a little too whimsical. Far removed from the man indifferent about children dying on his factory tour
"This movie looks lit, i am gonna watch it on Christmas."
"Looks like one that I don't need to see . Why does it look generic ? This is what AI films will be someday , a bunch of CGI and a bucket load of random pieces of different movies patched together and shatt out ."
The OLD the Best
Phoenix Buchanan from Paddington 2 AKA Hugh Grant being an Oompa loompa I can't wait for this 😅😂
1:41. Wait is that mr bean
Not my Wonka
"I Can't Wait❤
Born 1969, taking my Grandaughter to see this❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉"
They casted the wrong person for this role. Not buying Chalemet as Wonka.
it's that guy that can't get th orange stuff off his face
the main character of the bear would have made a better wonka
Example of a movie that literally no one asked for.
Long live Gene Wilder. The real Willy Wonka.
More woke trash- avoid!
Another Willie Wonka movie???
"1:15 ""Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity"""
Gonna bring my Golden ticket to the movie theaters watching this. 😂
"why is everyone so hyped up, this movie looks so GARBAGE. 
1. The oompa loompas arent suppose to talk only when someone messed up
2. Where’s the classic chocalate factory with all the creative candy looking designs
3. Wheres Charlie?
4. Wheres the golden ticket?
5. The actor looks like a homeless man
They ruined Willy wonka"
Bring back Johnny Depp
Waste of a movie
Holy mackerel I- I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks AWFUL....No thank you....Stick with the one and only worth seeing.  Gene Wilder in 1971 Willy Wonk & the Chocolate Factory.  No need for a prequel if it's garbage and doesn't even remotely align with what is supposed to have been the follow-up original.
Looks terrible
This looks bad lmao sorry but it's true😭
"Boycotting ,,,, Free Palestine 🇵🇸"
More wokeness!!! No thanks!!!
Wonka s Jonhie Deep
Not woke enough... All characters should be played by black people...
Do we _really_ need another remake of this?  Gene Wilder must be rolling over in his grave.
I feel sorry for this guy...he is no Johnny Depp
I need this on Amazon please 🥺
Looks amazing credit to Warner Bros. Shame Disney don’t make movies like this anymore.
I'm seeing it.
"I’m an old guy…haven’t been to the theater in ages…but this is one I want to see.

I know it’s going to be incredibly entertaining, and visually spectacular on the big screen."
Come on lads. Marvels all over again.
I don’t know about this one🤔
Another woke production.
It’s amazing how bad movies can be these days
He took my idea of making a Wonka movie about the beginning with a young Willy
Nothing says old London like diversity equity and inclusion. Good thing they didn’t hire real struggling little people who need work huh? I guess its inclusive to not include
Looks great!   Glad to hear that Timothée Chalamet is a big fan of the previous films.  So respectful & charming.  The ideal Willy Wonka.
why did no one tell me this is a musical?
Let’s ruin another franchise is it?
Why did we need this???
Meanwhile in real life Paul Atreides is drowning his sorrows in spice.
Why oh why the American accents .....
Another woke movie😂
This looks dreadful and anyone whos looking forward to it is a bot
LMFAO
"This trailer attempts to give off that old school feel, but it's way too peppy. Gene Wilder had the ability to be both dark and fun."
"Dunno if it’s just me, but this Wonka feels like a combination of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp’s Wonkas"
This might be the best iteration of Willy Wonka we will ever see!
All these movies are stupid!!!.There will never be one like Gene Wilder.They have to remake to satisfy black people.Every movie has to include them for their new history.Lmao.I would never spend a dime.I grew up with these movies.....im not white nor black.Thank god🙏.My family have never judged anyone by skin color...but when u watch news on tv....it sure isn't Asian..white kids stealing at major stores...throwing people on train tracks...beating up elderly.....robbing cab drivers.Oh...one more thing.No such thing as black Santa Claus!!!.Every f commercial is just lying to kids!!!!.I believed in Santa Claus... he is from the North pole.No black folks hang out in snow..north pole.Santa has beautiful marble blue eyes..Lovely white beard..hair .Merry xmas all!!😝😝😝🤶🤶
"That chamalet guy can't do it. He's utterly void of any human feelings. He's a mother's fantasy son. A selfish mother.
Mark my words, it won't do 330M WW. 
Not much more at least."
Wow this looks utterly shite. Congrats WB
"""Once we've started dancing, we can't stop."" 😂"
No thanks. Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka.  Period.
When are movie folks going to come up with anything original? Stop rehashing great movies.
😂😂yes bravo...🎉🎉🎉
I cant wait
Noooo Willy Wonka has to be British 😭😭😭😭😭It looks good tho especially Mathew Baytown from Horrible Histories being in it
Sorry but a no for me can't beat the 1971 version
Im a simple man. I see mathew baynton in a trailer and I run to the cinema
Blasphemy!! Don’t go there. But I might stream it. GENE IS WONKA 💙
Popcorn soda 🍿🥤 chocolate 🍫
Pg Christmas movies
Assume
They should’ve done a different film where Charlie’s actor from the original gives up the factory to the next person akin to Gene Wilder.
This has NOTHING to do with the Willy Wonka.
acho que essa será a primeira vez que criticarei o Timotinho 😢
this should be the movie celebrating one hundred anniversary of warner brothers
"I dont like it,Wonka with Deep is real Wonka."
"Y’all need to get help. There are people like me who have wanted a new Wonka movie for years. And here we are, months before the movie even released, y’all talking about how bad it is. So judgmental smh."
Jesus loves you ❤Read the Bible
I’m not waiting 28 days for this
"I'm sorry, i know it's not a remake, but it doesn't make sense to have a prequel since the Wonka from the past never told about his mother, at any point, so adding a totally different plot and i question you why? besides, Thimothée is beautiful and yes i think it's an honor to play the role of Willy, one of the classics, but we have to agree that he doesn't have the essence of Wonka, his strange and eccentric way, he just says things which leaves it like that, but the expressions are always the same lol. anyway."
There were no African Americans in the original Willy Wonka so there should be none in this one either. The era did not have them.
WOKE GARBAGE
Willy Woke Wonka
There's only one willy wonka
Trash without johnny
Mygod mister beannnn
This is the 3rd Willy Wonka movie (that I know of there can be more) but Hollywood is really out of ideas…. Original movies r dead now
I am glad this isn’t just another recreation of the OG story
"Oh, it's a prequel, well I can agree with that..."
All this is is Hollywood making another fantasy movie that's unrealistic and made to make you feel bad about yourself then.
Is this a prequel or something? I don’t see Charlie in the trailer. 🤔
only watching cause mr bean
I’m so game. I’m on it.
i don't like this so much chocolate in the move need more white chocolate
Let’s keep remaking the same 20 movies that we know will sell instead of taking a risk on an original story.
This looks horrible.
What are we gonna do “Willy?” Got me dying 😂😂
I dont think Roald Dahl would have approved of this if he was alive. He didnt like the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
This looks awful
This looks horrible
If jonny deph anit part of it i aint watching it !!
"It looks really good, I haven't been excited to see a movie in so long I almost forgot how it feels."
No one can replace johnny depp NO ONE!!
Two-bit Gene Wilder impression
I’m cool with an origin story l🍫  🎩
1:41. Father Blackadder and the Crisis of Faith.
This looks boring af!
Woke Wonka. Lolz
This looks terrible.
This movie is better than the others also with timothees classic line 😂
"It takes a special type to pull off the role of Willy Wonka. I'd say Wilder, Depp and Chalamet are as a worthy a trio as any."
I still think Wonka should have been portrayed by a black female actress. This movie perpetuates the patriarchy.
Timothée as Willy Wonka? Never would’ve expected it but I love him so I’m excited!
"Man, they brought back the original Oompa-Loompas and I'm happy."
"Jesus, come up with an original idea for once."
Please Remove this Movie & we didn’t ask for it!!
And hes too much of a weep with beyond low self esteem to be willy wonka LMAO
FREE PALESTINE
Sooo cancelled he made fun of dying Palestines in the snl show SHAME ON UUU
I liked my own comment. 🤣
You will never beat the original
Wow.... no any ideas of new films.
He said skywalker
Hhhhhh
Suprised Wonka isnt black lmao 😂😂😂😂😂
I really hope this is a real good movie to the Willy Wonka franchise!!🙏🏽🤎🤎
0:56
"Oh man, I seriously thought this was Daniel Thrasher"
Call me weird but Timothee looks even hotter in this willy wonka costume
"I think I speak for everybody when I say they should’ve made Rowan Atkinson Willy Wonka this would’ve been hilarious and quite frankly, I’m kind of shocked that he took a side roll"
I heard one of the Oompah Loompahs is going to be transgender.
Nope.
I’m so excited for this u don’t get it
"The Wonka in this trailer doesn't depict any of the allusions of darkness that Wonka had in either of the two previous films that hinted at the deviousness of his nature. The sort of mad scientist, teetering between genius and insanity. Someone whose passion led to obsession. This one just says weird words with none of that in the delivery. You could say it's a prequel so he hasn't become that yet, but I would argue it's still less interesting so why bother?  That's a rhetorical question. I mean, the movie could be great but this trailer isn't selling me on it."
cant say willie wonka a dumb race cant say 2 words its to complicated
please stop raping the things i loved as a child.
"Destroying a perfect and magnificent classic  somethings can never be duplicated , replaced nor surpassed"
Of coarse it had to be a black chick! Wtf this is gonna be woke
They better not ruin this
Poppy
Why is Willy Wonka a 15 year old?
Rowan Atkinson  love this man
I'll rent it on home rentals or wait for it to come out on cable. Not theater worthy and theaters are done
Nobody asked for this
"Look, we ALL love Chalamet. But for Willy Wonka? Nope. Not when we have a real life Willy Wonka in Ezra Miller! You wouldn't even need a big budget, just give him a briefcase full of chocolate and a documentary crew made up of singing & dancing ex-cons all with Growth Hormone Deficiency to be his documentary crew and follow him everywhere and VOILA! 
Ezra and the GHD Dancers will make Chocolately Magic with minors and wards of the state all around the world!"
I miss the old wonka
I'm sorry but he doesn't have Mr Depp personality .
It's clearly a prequel to the classic Willy Wonka film we know and love.
Slugworth is white not black. I knew this was going to be woke
0:35 the building actually looks like Gringotts Bank
noooo why didnt they cast johny depp again😭😭
Wtf why did they showcase Wonka's pet monkey more than Rowan Atkinson!?
Give it up leave the original movie alone OK 😡
"The look and feel of this reminds me of “Mr. Magorium’s Wonder Emporium” (Dustin Hoffman, Natalie Portman, and Justin Bateman) 😬"
I like the way you baked it
You got to love the heat 🔥
Fairy buds remember me as I was
Why so many chocolate people?
Hugh Grant ...from Love Actually to an Oomba Loomba...Out of a woman's diary to a Chocolate Factory...Wow
Ngl that police uniform is 🔥
Its very hard to believe that man when he says “I’m Willy Wonka.” Not a good role for Chalamet.
I'm going to pass on this but I wish everyone the best.
No wonder they don’t want to pay writers more! They can’t even come up with originals! This the SECOND remake of Willy Wonka! Not interested!
The acting looks awful 😢 Johnny Depp played the perfect Willy Wonka. This guy doesn’t portray him right
"Yeah,I think I'll stick to my WB boycott."
Yeah this is definitely from the producer of Harry Potter I thought this was a fantastic beasts installment
This isn’t Willy Wonka or Wonka can’t we just keep the film with the funny man and the funny hair and not have this trash
"This is not Roald Dahl's vision...
How can this be Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if it's Wonka's origin .. must have an abundance of black actresses... Will not be paying to see your diversity WB... How ever could wonka have done it without a black girl and no midgets..."
This young wonka isent hitting the magic of older wonka.
i'm watching this only for the oompa loompas
Oh man this movie is ganna be awesome!! Take my money!!!! 💰 💴
Terrrible casting
"The sequel to this will be a prequel about Hugh Grant's character.  It will be called ""Loompa"""
Nobody asked for this. If this doesn’t rank I’ll be so surprised unless every kid wants to see it
Hollywood has been out of ideas for a long time...
Wow I’m seriously happy for Lil Mabu making his debut as Willy Wonka. Genuinely happy for the squirt.
So Pixie dust is in the Chocolate? Did WANKA kidnap Tinkerbell????
Remember when Hollywood writers went on strike because they feared that AI would replace them and they weren’t paid enough? Who needs them when everything coming out of Hollywood is a remake with a woke twist?
Why would anyone ever watch this?
Why?
The moment when Wonka looked straight into the camera and said “I’m the one who Loompas” was the moment he truly became Heisenwonka.  Vince Gilligan really is the genius of our time.
"I think they should have followed the story line.... But its whatever... I just hope its not a waste of time in my life watching this ..

The kid in the movie willy wonka with johnny Depp had access to the whole factory, AND his secret ingredients to making the chocolate after being the last child to win at the end... 

And i think if he had grown up and wonka had died, and he tried to handle everything on his own it would have been a great story. Definitely if he had succeeded through troubles of trying to figure it out... 

THIS.... is completely off the originals. And its basically a coin toss for bad or good..."
cant wait for mr bean to be in this movie
Prediction?…..pain.
"That chocolate that made you fly, that's an edible"
Its adorable
Ofc it's him
"It looks fun, but did they read the book though?"
Willy w⚓️
Terrible CGi and it’s way too heart warming. Not for me.
I'm gonna definitely enjoy this
I’m Exicited for This Movie.
this actually looks really interesting. THIS is how you reboot
It would be awsome if johnny depp could have his cameo as the grown up willy wonka
It would be awsome if johnny depp could have his cameo as the grown up willy wonka
Caramel
King I would like to smoke with you donot run fire
It’s 2023 why isn’t Wonka a black female?
"The original quote is 
""STRIKE THAT, REVERSE IT"" 
I quess to strike would seem masculine toxicity."
Man Timothée Chalamet is a talented actor. I hope he becomes one of the greats.
why tf is charlie black tho😭
This looks.... Bad.
Ompa loompa cgi looks so bad omg
"Chalamet as Wonka. 
Common…"
"they got a little kid playing willy wonka, how cute"
Reddit the movie
CORNYyy
1:42 Mr Bean/Rowan in the house.
i think the marketing team just made it seem worse than it is but it seems kinda good
Is it too late to cancel?
I only watch WB trailers to find subliminal pedophile messages
Pretty much every comment here seem fake
"Other than the floating candy, this seems like it could be any other movie or even plot, just exchange chocolatier and chocolate factory. He does not have the charismatic eccentricity (whether Wilder or Depp flavored)"
Where is Charlie???
The lead actor performance is cringe worthy.  What a let down from the Wilder and Depp.
Oh no. I knew they were gonna include diversity cast just for the sake of it in a time where it doesn’t belong. I was excited but now I’m gonna have to pass on this one
They could have made Devine Brown an Oompa Loompa too...
Time to go back to the movies this Christmas with my daughter Erika and her boyfriend.
The original is always the best ..
"WARNER BROS RAN OUT OF IDEAS ... THE THIRD REMAKE. ? R U KIDDING ME . 
GIVE US A BREAK"
"This is disappointing, Timothy ruins it for me"
Stop with the God damn rehashed movies.
"They had to add a dose of Woke, didn’t they… 🙄"
Nothing can top the original
Some serious nods to Gene Wilder and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Hopefully this film does it justice.
What a shame.
"He is ""too normal"" .
Worst cast ."
"This looks stupid, gratuitous and retarded."
prefer depps adaptation and the vibe was different too it had a somewhat disturbing tone to it with the crazy kids too.. this seems too innocent
Always a black and white thing. Ruin another good memory.
This is gonna be a great movie when I watch it
I don't think we needed this. Why does Hollywood have the need to remake and destroy classics?
My favorite part was when I stayed home and watched the original Willy Wonka movie.
"if they have rowan in it,  ykits a banger"
Is dat lil mabu?
NOOO THEY TURNED LITTLE CHARLIE INTO A CHOCOLATE WOMAN
Oh I love this film already
Yet ANOTHER Willy Wonka movie! This is exactly what audiences have been asking for! How did they know we needed a 3rd Willy Wonka movie! But this time let's delve into his back story!
Disneys agenda checklist hard at work here! Looks horrible!!
Looks stupid
Meh no.
"Oh man, it's a prequel to the original WWATCF, not the 2005 one..
What a shame, I ain't gonna watch it"
Looks like hot garbage. But on the plus side it looks like they got all the boxes checked off for equity and inclusion
I heard that the oopma loompa looks similar to the 1971 flim called “Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory”
The movie no one wants or cares about.
"Johnson from Peep Show (Paterson Joseph) is Slugworth. I noticed him in a recent tetley ad on the radio too. I don't think I've ever seen him in a major movie. It looks like a fun xmas family movie. 87K dislikes so far however suggests fair criticism for a trailer. At the moment you'll have one half of social media screaming it's too pc and the other screaming at Hugh Grant for potentially stealing a height challenged role. Lol. The only real disappointing thing is that it's yet another remake in all honesty. It's clearly largely a UK production given the majority of the cast. Let's hope Rowan Atkinson has a Bean like role (unlikely, but you can always hope...)"
"I’ll stick with the original, like all the great movies, 80s and before."
"A little on the WOKE side, but no surprise here! And the Oscar(By regulation) will not go to Willie! Just saying! What a wonderful world!"
mr bean in here too!
MARY FROM PADDINGTON🥹🥹🥹
Kids might like it
I loved the part where Willem Dafoe’s Norman Osborne said “I’m something of a chocolatier myself” really made me understand his relationship to both Peter Parker and Willy Wonka 😂
The obligatory black female lead role is kinda whack
Looks more like Wakanda than 1930’s England. Wtf is this trash?
Yes more black people inserted for no reason. No thanks
"Didn’t we already have the remake of this with depp? 
That flopped. 
How unimaginably original by Hollywood. A film nobody asked for again."
❤
a WOKE Wonka
I’m a kid from the 80s. No Willy Wonka will ever be as good as Gene Wilder. That Willy Wonka movie will never be topped. This looks fantastically terrible.
MR BEAN
Are there any original ideas?
You got Mr. Bean in this movie.
"First Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory(1971), then Charlie and the Chocolate Factory(2005), and now Wonka(2023)."
Nope. Just nope.  You can never beat Classic with Gene wilder. This actually looks very Disney; and that’s a huge insult. 🤢🤢🤢
don't need another remake WB
why do they have to keep redoing these masterpieces
I’m glad they always replenishing the Walmart discount bins with new variety :)
Woke 🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
I love that little easter egg at 1:50. Mary from Paddington.
I dont remember africans all over the place in the first wonka. African cops in Victorian england? SUREEE OK what planet is this move set in? It's not earth..
Willy Woke
"It's a woke version. Checking all the boxes of that virtual signaling  propaganda. So how many indigenous people where successful in 1930's England? 
Why is it so important to fake history. Embrace what it was and for God's sake, tell the truth. For once."
Ew
Even the trailer has a stolen joke.  Thats not a good sign.
Tf was that.
New movie!!!!
We didnt need a 3rd movie..
Wonka in the reichstag
Hes no gene wilder
Wait -- Charlie is now a Black girl?
This has nothing to do with the actual story . He doesn't fit the look . He still resembles a child . SMH He had issues with his father and abandonment. He found family NOT LOVE. This is all wrong .
"Hugh grant is oompa loompa ? Oooo I will see it, I want to see an oompa loompa with British accent."
This looks like hot trash from a dumpster fire. They should’ve called it “Willy Woke-a.”
"Ya know what made the 60s version great? A fantastical shop situated in a grim semi-realistic world. Here the real world is already fantastical, so what's the conflict? Bahhhh who cares it'll be a fun thing to watch with the fam"
💩
They ruined another classic.
2.5 stars... Maybe.
1:41 Mr.Beaaannnn
"Please god, don't be *Willy Woman and the Woke Factory* please... 😢"
What's the point? It's impossible to improve on Gene Wilder and the charm and real special effects in the original.
From Gene Wilder... to this. Sad times.
"first we had Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory movie  (1971)  then we had Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005)
now we're getting a new movie  called Wonka (2023)


im shocked to know its the movie that shows Wonka's eary days before the Factory and on how he came to be"
A Willy Wonka origins movie... we're beyond scraping the barrel at this point. We're licking the timber
Gene Wilder is the only Willy Wonka!
💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩🤮💩
Yup I absolutely wont be watching this. Originality is dead
"In the current era of movies, I could honestly do with some whimsy from a childhood classic IP. Looking forward to it."
As soon as I heard jarvis speak as the ompa lompa :D I smiled
What a shame! It's almost like Hollywood has no clue what made the first movie great.
Finally a Snowpiercer prequel
CGI massacre
Blacksun's GEEA ;)// WONKA
Idk about his acting on this I'm not sold on the wackyness seems held back
It's too late... I've started dancing now ...😂😂😂
Will it be a musical movie? Like disney?
I feel like it's a nerdy kids saying coll phrases making him seem weird or trying too hard to fit in.... I don't like it
Who asked for this?
Marilyn Manson needs to be Mr.Wonka. This looks really Lame.
❤
"437K versus 87K. The fact one in five are dislikes is kind of telling. Forced diversity hires are easy to spot and Timothée Chalamet as Willie isn't exactly what I had in mind. Hugh as a Loompa is perfect casting however. 
Kinda sad we're now at the point where after several re-imaginings of the same book we're now making a prequel of it... Can't we do anything original anymore?
I'll wait until it's blown over, wait for proper reviews before throwing money at this."
Woke Wanka. Can't Wait.
Jhonny Deep es irremplazable...sorry Timoteo😅
Another flop.
"Looks Weird, not buying his acting at all for playing Willy Wonka! Looks like he's trying to hard to be someone he's not. Hard Pass!"
ESG DEI WOKE MADNESS
Why haven't I heard of this until just now? And it was only because I got a notification from my local theater
Chalamets lack of acting ability really shines here
BOYCOTTTT. Filthy Zionist 🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Wow. Looks pure poo
We really didn't need this
Wonka goes woke.
Meh
Come on. 🤦
Love Hugh Grant in this role.
It’s not the same without gene wilder he is the real Willy wonka
❤❤❤
"Wow, can't wait to see this amazing movie~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~"
Love it when Uncle Ben says with Great White Chocolate come Great White Chocolate Power
Ill just watch the old ones
"I really hope the movie is better then the trailer. This looks terrible, the acting looks  horrific. But, it is just a trailer."
Why?
I can't wait to see this movie ! the cast sounds brilliant !
Miss you Johny depp..💔💔
"1:02 Hold up, is that Rowan Atkinson??"
I can not wait to see it
Should have been called “Woka”.
Rowan attinkson? 1:03
This dude plays a HORRIBLE wonka what were they thinking
The new willy wonka 🥺🥺🥺
"This doesn't look interesting, but I hope it is interesting."
Iv always liked Willy Wonka because hes a cannibal
Dissapointed
You'll never surpass the charm of the first movie. So why try?
I don't think anyone wanted a Wonka origins story. Oh well.
Now He looks like Wonka
How many times does this movie need to be remade??  LOL!!
"The chalamet dude as wonka just feels wrong, tbh"
"anyone came from him that vid of timothee ""promoting"" it 🤣"
Skip it and watch the original.  Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka.  No one else.
this... this movie has magic
"My sister's just told me about this film. What a sweet surprise! I can't wait to see it!
Thanks! 😃
Oompa, loompa, doom-pa-dee-doo 🎶💚"
"I wonder how it would be like to see Wonka meet the Doctor from Doctor Who, Miss Frizzle, James Bond, and Mary Poppins."
Yes please!!!❤😮😊
Jhonny Depp ❤
No one can beat gene
chalamet wonka
free palestane🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸🇵🇸
Any chance Hollywood could greenlight a new idea?
1:02 Mr bean?? 1:41 afraid Mr bean??
18 years after 2005
Kinda cringe.. no one beats Johnny
Another great classic gets the woke treatment. Roald Dahl must be turning in his grave!
"I got chills when he said ‘here we go , ‘momma’’"
"I love the idea of this and look forward to watch this, but I do also believe that the lines were delivered a bit flatly. The previous Wonka's were more ""crazy"" (if that's the right word), whereas this one seems more normal."
Roald Dahl didn't even approve of the original movie. He must be rolling in his grave right now.
Did not spark my interest !

"From my view the plot is amazing as I love willy wonka films,  but not all of this film is good . I belive that  the special efects are very  simple to be in 2023 but it has also good things like the setting . From my poin t of view the film is  recrated in the good time.There are not many things to say abaut the soundtrack , is good althought I think that is the sama in all scenes . It is a good film, I recommend it."
"If you look closely at the girl during the “huh” scene, you can see her looking at the script to see her next line….. bruh"
I can’t wait to not watch this junk.
Looking forward!❤
-____-
Everything is a damn remake these days. Make something new that's a classic for once ffs.
Think I’ll stick with the original that wasn’t concerned with quotas in films.
I didn’t even recognise Keegan at first LMAO
Loved the book. Loved the original film. Can't wait!
No thanks! There's only one Wonka!
"i am not feeling this version at all, What made the first one the best is the sarcasm,This movie doesn't have it. Plus, this movie is too magical. The first one was simple and right to the point. This one is too bubbly. I am just not feeling it."
"I love it! the film is very gripping, because is a film that is isn’t predictable.
In my view the especial effects are fantastic, and the characters too, the plot is believable, and the soundtrack the best.
I love the film! Is the best film ever, is very interesting and funny too.
The best is that is suitable for very age!"
"From my point of view, the trailer is not something that attract attention.
I don't see the relationship with the original film . It's  looks like a slow and boring movie... the only thing I can talk well is about the actor who interprets Willy Wonka, they made a good choice in the actor. The plot wasn't interesting and the soundtrack...anything special, but the special effects wasn't bad but too basic for this charming movie 😶."
"I like this trailer because take about Chocolate,is incredible becasuse it has may special effects and that makes it attrac more atention"
"From my point of view, the film is very fascinating, it is slowly and charming film, but I think the plot is too disappointing, the soundtrack is pleasant and the special effects are normal.
I like the character of Wily Wonka because he is very charming, I love this film. 
I saw this movie many times when I was little."
"Wow, from Johnny Depp to Timothee Chalamet. Super love!"
I Can't Wait!!!!!!!!!!!
This looks amazing.
"The fact that he says Scratch That, Reverse it and not Strike That, Reverse It already make this a classic."
Let's Gooooooooo
"Anyone can do Wonka better than Depp, that was just awful."
he reminds me so much of bernard the elf
The fact that Danny devito isn’t the Oompa Loompa hurts my very soul.
"2:15, I have a feeling that will transition into a musical number in the movie"
"Looks promising, but Wonka is a hard character to play. I don't see it."
"The trailer got me so bored 😑 
Pass"
"1:27 He’s good. 
Too good."
Another sugar coated movie? Sell outs.
This is meh.. but I'll watch it for Olivia Colman
Fantastic
"I love this trailer! Really, this trailer has all comedy, action...It is the Best trailer I could see.The soundtrack is surprising, the characters are interesting and so funny, my favorite is Wonka.The custome designer is wonderful! It is so elegant.The plot is thrilling and the special effects are fascinating.Really I recommend this film if You like fiction movies"
"Hi everyone!
I think that the trailer is really good,the soundtrack is too loud for me but I guess my ears are the sensitive ones,haha.
Anyways,I feel like the plot is really interesting,thrilling and hilarious lol 😂
The characters are amusing but the Oompa Loompa is quite... interesting,I guess.
I mean,it's funny,but it reminds me of a tomato or a watermelon,LMAO 😂
It's also quite surprising to see his size, my nephew is taller than the Oompa Loompa and he's only 8 years old,HAHAHAHAHA.
Anyways,have a good day and thanks for riding this. 💋🌹"
I love this film! In my opinion that the soundtrack is perfect to the film becouse sounds like magic. There are some amazing  specials effects that comes you to other magic world. From my point of view the characters are fantastic and the oufits are so good
"In my opinion the Wonka trailer is very good because it has a very good soundtrack, a good plot, it is science fiction but it does not have many special effects and the characters are different than the first movie but they are good."
"Nope, too politically correct for me, not true to the time period of the film, typical of these days!!! 🤔"
This looks stupid.
I want to see the movie since it is a mix of Christmas and magic and you might know more about the story.
"In my view, it is very interesting and  fascinating. The character are the best, because he si very funny. The soundtrack is surprising."
"In my humble opinion, this is one of the most surprising movies I have ever seen. Is gripping because Willy Wonka has a charming personality. I believe that It has a spectacular special effects and a predecible soundtrack because is the same that the first film of Willy Wonka. In conclusion,  I'm looking forward to seeing this movie."
"I believe the plot is interesting, surprising and it thought provoking because leaves you with intrigue. From my point of view the characters are gripping because they speak with ellipses and they ate curious. I feel the soundtrack is surprising because is noisy and suddenly is silence and it is little disgusting. My point in special effects is pleasant and good."
"From my point of view ,the trailer is amazing,the plot is very gripping,the soundtrack is slow,the character is suprising because there are a lot of type,and the special effect is fascinanting,I want to wacht this film!!"
"I love this trailer because I,m mad about chocolate. From my point of view, the characters are very cheerful and crazy. I think the plot is very surprising and special effects are fascinating. Beside, the soundtrack is wonderful."
It’s literally insane how ALL THEY HAD TO DO was *not* cast Timothee Chalamet…
*Why?*
"The Key phrase  ""Every Good thing in this world started with dream."" which is the soul of this movie"
Hes just not wonka enough idk Wilder and Depp set the bar too high imo this has tv movie vibe like abc family 😂
Flop
Something original for the love of god.
"So, Roald Dahl DIDN'T write a prequel to Willie Wonka.  Someone else has written it and decided for him what his character(s)' origin story is.  Wonderful.  [not]."
"In my opinion the trailer is really cool. I love the costumes and the decorations. The plot seems really interesting. The characters are very different and there are a lot. From my point of view the soundtrack isn’t something really remarkable, but I’m not saying that it’s bad at all. The special effects are so real. impressive, I think they look so real."
I loved the original Willy Wonka but I think this looks pretty good 😊
They forgot to add in his dad being the dentist 😂
Looks 🔥
I'm not feeling it.  Gene Wilder will always be the real Willy Wonka.
Looks absolutely pathetic
Tarea 17
Missed chance to make his origin story into a horror
The dude in the thumbnail looks like the dude from Lies of P
"""dark, white, nutty, absolutely insane"" is one of the most cringe-inducing deliveries of a line I've ever seen"
What happened to house atreides?
This is so dumb
Looks as stupid as the Johnny Depp disaster
I love that part in 1971 but kinda cool ❤
Most uncharismatic Willy Wonka
"Well ,chocolate was discovered by the Mayans in Mexico. I hope GenZ wont believe this movie as real history"
Genial

Ya quiero ver a la Willy Wonka
Que emoción por ver wonka lo mejor que pudieron sacar
"Me encanta, totalmente espectacular, gracias"
Es una película súper maravillosa me encanta
Timothee Chalamet channeling his inner Gene Wilder & Johnny Depp! :)
Woka and the equity factory
"I've not been this excited over a film's release for a good few years, especially when I found out Simon Farnaby and Paul King were behind it! Can't wait!"
More Chocolate People please.
nice to see peep show carrying the casting
Bring back the original cast is amazing from jhonny deep one is amazing
Perfecta me gusta
that aint willy wonka thats jilly jonka
1:52 me after I put my mom’s house as collateral for the 27-leg parlay I just made
mr beannnnnn
I loved the part where chamalet - Just chamaleted
"whatever that actor is, the age is not appropriate for the role thus this movie is instanly irrelevant"
"No matter how good the movie is, won't be the same without Johnny Depp..
Something still missing.."
Yaaawn. WB ruins a timeless classic. Can't wait to see Netflix blow them out the water.
"well that,s a first seeing a run away giraffe in this new willy wonka movie"
Me gusta
The actress who acted as the mother of charlie and the chocolate factory is in this movie!
Fk your remake
No
I personally liked the original 1970s movie the best and at 1:52  just that 2 seconds made me so incredibly happy. I hope they sing pure imagination or at least the theme. Oh man 🥲
Timothee acting in this trailer is a lot more like peter parker then Willy wonka😂
"Totally nostalgic!!! Totally magical! I always miss story! Anyway, can't they make a sequel after the prequel?"
So what happens that there are no longer people of Color later in the story/timeline?
"Little people should be getting these roles. Its crazy they call it pc, however they are taking jobs from people. I will be boycotting this movie just like Snow White. I hope they start giving these people their roles back."
Woke garbage
"Again another complete waste of time and money making a trash,Rubbish garbage remake of a classic.
Ths is definitely taken it to far.
Again leave the Originals Alone  as you cant change them and give only what the originals have that makes them special. 
Its been done many times and failed very badly. 
There will be those many who will love this remake for whatever lack of very bad knowledge understanding only the Originals are always the real true classic Best.
It was exactly the same with the Remake of Annie and the Remake of Witches.
Leave the originals alone as no matter how many times a remake with changes just doesn't have that same feeling as the originals. 
How anyone would like this i wont ever know or understand. 
Remakes are a waste of time money and are only Trash,Rubbish, Garbage for the Litter trash rubbish garbage Bin."
Looks awful 😔
I can't wait to see this because Timmy has a way of making everything great
i love the part where will wonk setup a puppet government in Mogadishu to get the exclusive rights to the Cacao tree
"I'm sorry but timothee as Wonka is so random and honestly, it's kinda bad performance for willy wonka"
"yeah, no"
"Runawayyyy
01:41"
"A Trilogy?! This is my hope….this film, Charlie and the Chocolate factory for part 2, then finished up with The Great Glass Elevator….🤞🤞🤞ps if this wasn’t the film company’s original idea….I will take royalties"
Total garbage. Horrible casting and acting. I love the two books and the original movie. Roald Dahl is spinning in his grave.
"BLACKWASH.
BOYCOTT THE BLACKWASH"
👍👍👍
❤❤
فلام جدا وجذابة ❤❤❤
There are WAY too many chcocolate people in my chocolate man movie. Race hire quotas EVERYWHERE! 🤮 its better without the chocolate people!! Chocolate is always sweeter with less diversity
what does kylie jenner feels about this? i wonder
"Looks like any cringe Junior High first year stage play. And of course, forced dIvErSiTy.😑 Mr. Bean deserved better"
Willy WOKE opss Wonka é BLACK 😐
"And still no real life Legendary Wonka Bar , F you 🤣😂"
2:05
"I dunno... its hard to hold a candle to Gene's whirlwind performance, but an origin story is cool. Hugh on the other hand was an awesome choice!!!"
"To everyone who thinks Chalamet is not fit to play Willy Wonka, that’s nonsense. He’s a great actor whom I think really fits the character of Willy Wonka. He also looks similar to Gene Wilder"
1:54😍😃
Gerçekten harika bir senaryo ve mükemmel bir hayal gücü sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum
çok güzel harika
Is this a sequel or a prequel?
The trailer made me cry already before the actual movie did 😂😭😭
Is this a musical movie?
One name Gene wilder no matter how many times you remake it its never going to be better than the first one
I just want to see the sword he keeps hidden in the cane.
Interesante y entretenida película no se la pierda.
tengo muchas ganas de verla se mira que va a estar bonita a ver si supera la original
Muy buena

Me encantan este tipo de películas

Very good entertainment movie for the whole family
Espero que llene las taquillas en el estreno y tengo varios premios
"Esta es una película obligatoria de ver si o si, me gustó mucho la trama.
La recomiendo a todos"
Se ve que estará buena y es la tercera en el reparto
Excelente película.
Super atrapante
Me encanto desde el principio la mejor  que e visto
It will be interesting to know the life of Willy Wonka
"Me encanta, te atrapa desde el inicio, excelente producción."
Genial
Perfecta película 🎥
Willy Woka. What kind of Wonka’s came up with this idea?
i hope the chartel wins
"Ngl, from the thumbnail, I thought they made willy Wonka black."
Breathtakingly bad. 😅
Why do they discriminate agains little people actors. This is basically black face. Do better hollywood.
Looks horrible
Cant they make any NEW movies.
This looks truly awful.
"George Weasley is Willy Wonka.
Change my mind."
i love you daddy Willy
I wish it had been played by Jhonny Depp 😿👽
Mehhh
Where's the space exploration
Can someone tell me why chocolate maker isn't played by black or brown 😂
Chalamet looks forgettable in this.
KAR DO
This is my inspiration for tending my portfolio brand right noowww
Why not cast actual little ppl as oompa loompas like the OG Willy Wanka and the chocolate factory? They were great!
"Guys, Im only here bc ok Katy’s impression of Alyssa Edwards as Willy Wonka"
"I'll give it a shot, it looks charming.
Lets see what this can be."
Woke Wonka!  Culturally appropriating another classic.  Glad to see the writers are still on strike
Might see it just for Keegan Michael Key. He's funny af in every role
Why is no one talking about how Mathew Baynton is in this movie!?
can’t wait to watch this while eating lots of chocolates
Looks extremely uninteresting. They have to stop rebooting what was already perfect
Watching Dune 2 and then watching this will be crazy
Literally couldn’t even get through the trailer it’s so cringe . Damn
People can't make anything original anymore?
"Thanks, but it's an ""absolutely not"" from me.
😅"
"So Mr Wonka, we've examined your loan application and I just have one question for you. Are you a pathetic, worthless punk?"
Wonka is getting younger and younger
Once again...changing the story
ALYSSA EDWARDS REALNESS
I love how deliciously whimsical a chocolate cartel sounds. Genuinely looking forward to the spider reviews to follow.
"Not that this is a huge deal but this movie has retconned the Oompa Loompa origin; in the book and the Tim Burton movie, Willy Wonka only met the Oompa Loompa in a tribe. It doesn't matter much, but it is cool to spot a retcon for myself!"
"Warner Bros, THANK YOU FOR REMAKE WILLY WONKA AS MY HISTORY MARK. I'm still SELLING EXPENSIVE FOOD, SALE CHEAP PRICE FOR THE POOR BY MY SECRET LINE OF BUSINESS!!!"
"""every good thing started with a dream."" Hitler fades in."
go timothee give us absolutely nothing with that line delivery!
we ready
This genuinely looks horrible.
Please don't make it woke Warner Bros.
"Willy Wonka and the ""CHOCOLATE""  factory 👨🏿‍🦲 sit this one out. Shame That's becoming a trend"
They should’ve had him as Charlie bucket since at the end of the original Charlie and the chocolate factory movie ending Charlie got the factory
"I love the part where Timothy said ""no scratch that reverse it"" and scratched that and reversed it all around. Truly a must watch movie"
"*""Come with me, to a world of pure imagination!""*

- Gene Wilder, Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory."
Lisan al Gaib!
Trailers
"Look at all the BoT comment's
😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂"
How did he gain the ability to be casually snarky and subtly creepy as he got older? The character is too clean and bright. I don’t feel like this is the kinda of person willing to take risks and seek out the unique.
Çook güzell❤❤
"It's not bashing, as a fan of the old and remake movie, i feel like Timothee is not that good at delivering lines and his facial expression is not convincing. But I do hope its only in the trailer."
Mr Bean!!!!!!!!! 😍Omg- my mom would have loved this movie- makes me sad she passed in 2011. I was watching The Voice and forwarded thru the commercial thinking this was just another remake🙄😬🤔🥱 but came here to watch the Trailer and wow- Looks fantastic!!!!! Wish you were here mom. 💞💝
Hollywood couldn’t come up with an original idea if its greasy depraved life depended on it… Pitiful.
Just came here for Rowan Atkinson.
The beginning is a jumpscare😭😭😭
This looks terrible.
Looks good!!!
Another?
Skip and watch the original
I can’t wait to see this movie
Looks absolutely idiotic.
"Hughmpa-Grantmpa is actually amazing. I hate his guts, but he seems actually hilarious in the role. He was born to play an oompa-loompa."
They should have hired Johny Depp
So is the black girl playing the role of charlie? Interesting 😅
"I'm sorry, but no."
I would love if the connect a Paddington cameo
Hollywood just when I thought 💭 I was out you bring me back in with this masterpiece.
Willie Woka
Gene Wilder said the other remake was an insult. I believe this one is too. You can't overcome the greatness of the first one. It's too beautiful and unique. No one can top it. They should stop messing with this movie.
He spent the past seven years searching for and enslaving Pygmies to make his chocolate.
I think I'm going to barf.
Is this the Daniel thrasher movie
I like how they made this like a new movie and not a remake of the original that would have ruined it for me now I might actually watch it
"Why does he talk like he has autism.. like an anime kid.  ""YOU SEE I""M SOMETHING OF A MAGICIAN""  Jfc.... just stop."
I really like the part where they took the skeleton of a masterpiece and reworked it into marvel-quipping trash
Chalamet was nooooot the move.
"Why did they have to put Rowan Atkinson as a priest in this movie? Laughing at one’s religion is not fine, but Roman Catholics, somehow, are an exception"
PLLLLS do not ruim my Will wonka and the chocolate factory memories
"eff off with all the contrived diversity, its our european heritage they are crapping on."
This has Mr. Bean in it? Why not just lead with that?
Yall can shove Timothy up yours. Not watching this washed and rewashed trash.
büyük bi sabırsızlıkla bekliyorum
MR BEAN TT
this is cringe worthy
Wonka is a great movie
His face like Charlie Puth
"awful, looks absolutely awful"
Waiting thala ❤
"The lines feel too normal, he's supposed to be an oddball. I really like Johnny Depp's version cause we was clearly a wacko. But this is just not strange enough"
I'm 52 years old.  I can not WAIT !!!!!! WOOOOOOOOOOOO
"omg, the trailer gives me goosebumps. can't wait to see it"
🤦🏼‍♀️
Seems a little tacky.
"Absolutely ridiculous! Leave the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka alone, you CANNOT improve on perfection. Please stop trying. And this is freaking bazaar 🤢"
Fun Fact all the smart people don't realize this is a origin movie instead they're busy screaming Remake
Only thing weird is how they took this in a more magical direction. Even adult Wonka hadn't perfected Fizzy lifting drink and all of his inventions had strange side effects. This younger Wonka seems too perfect.
This is a complete disgrace and bastardization of dahl's work.   More like Woke-a.     This negrophilia is absolutely insane.  Is Mike TV a transvestite?
Do we need this? We already have to versions of the movie.
Lil Mabu making chocolate instead of bread now
Too bad Timothee Chalamet is in it. Worst actor ever!
I hate this so much 😭
Not enought insanity for me. I like my wonka unhinged.
How dumb. The original wasn’t diverse enough and had too many midgets.
The new generation can't make anything of their own they have to keep rehashing what my generation grew up with. Pretty lazy and lame.
The best trailer i've ever seen this year..this movie definitely worth to wait.. 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼
Of course they have to put tokens in the movie!!!
Another garbage remake!!!
"No thanks. WB has proven they support abusers and punish victims. I will not support them in any way ever again. Also, stop remaking wonderful movies into garbage. Come up with something original for once."
"aw Sorry I'm Going to pass this Movie who Really behind it somebody will Be deep angered Who touched the H*ll this Remake
GO BACK and CRITICISM alike Movie Sonic way and fired this New whiter shouldn't Needed ban them has No Excuse touching a New
Journey by this Movie 
what a Psych move is That"
Wonka is white and not black? Is the world finally healing? Thank God
Iy bır kıno süper 10 Nomura 5 yuldız
"This trailer is just to much, tries way to hard."
No 😅
Where did these blacks come from? I didn’t see any in the original.
"ANOTHER ONE?

Stop remaking classics and MAKE NEW MOVIES WITH FRESH IDEAS.

THAT AREN'T WOKE!"
Johnny Depp was so incredibly amazing in this role that even great actors like Timothy give it a shot and are just bland. I'll pass.
boring
Who is the black child with him? This looking like a Sally Hemmings tale.
"Gotta be honest with ya""ll, I'm only watching this movie because Rowan Atkinson is in it."
WB running out of ideas lol
Mr. Beannnnnnnnn!!!!!!!!!!!!!😮😮😮😮😮😮
Are dwarves not allowed to act  anymore?
"I've started dancing now. Once we started, we cant stop. 🤣
❤🎉❤"
I got zero sense of the absurd wonder I would want from a Wonka film.
"Since this is a modern day adaptation, I wanna know which character is lgbtq2ai+"
A lot of people hating on this movie but watch how packed opening night gonna be and how fast them tickets going to sale 😢😂
It actually looks kinda interesting. It seems to be a prequil of sorts of how wonka came to be
So basically....Wonka Begin.
"Its going to flop . Just by this trailer it seems that they want to make it goofy and have some sort emotional back story with wacky situations . And random wacky characters and dance numbers. Ugh,flop"
Why do we keep recreating the same movie over and over again?
Oh look another example of racism in Hollywood.
Too many wakandans running around in my chocolate man movie.
How many race quota hires did you spot in this add?? Answer=TOO MANY
This trailer gave me cancer.
"Trailers from Disney movies are all the same, there is no color in the movie, Chalameet is flat as a punctured tyre, it has no punch. WHy people would pay to watch this?"
Will see it❤
Is Christopher Lee voice used in this.
Do we really need another incarnation of this story? I think not.
no
1:03 🔥
Keegan Michael key and Mr Bean along with the Christmas vibes is all I needed to be sold on this movie 😂
Looks blah to me!
This kid has a great future. Amazing actor.
Please don’t be woke
Finally something an inhumane world can come together with.  And its the only thing we all have in common...the sweet power and willing surrender of chocolate!
"I do not know how to feel about this.
I can only say for certain that I am intrigued🤔"
"No one will beat Gene Wilder's performance. Back then, you didn't need cgi. Just talent. Neither Depp or Chalamet have the ""edge"" needed for this role, and Wilder had that. You never knew what Wonka's next move was in the original."
Gotta add woke crapola? Sure. Boycotting is easy. Always with the race swapping nonsense.
Nice scenery but looks uninspiring. Wonka was a complicated character to understand but this version looks like some nonbinary teenie bopper. I’m sure they’ll be some hidden message about white supremacy or open borders in the movie lol
Omg i hafta see that for all my childhood imaginations of how it all started !!!!!
"I love how they mention who produced it, but at the end of the day a producers is just somebody who gives money -it doesn’t mean it’s going to be as good as other movies they’ve produced…"
I’m sorry…who asked for this….
This plays like an online training course. Zero interest in watching it.
"wow another original movie not made from movies that already exist 😃 hollywood doesn’t have imagination and creation to make new movies. and bad casting, this actor does give off any type of vibe from willy before or after he went insane, he’s trying to be so goofy and lines are so flat of emotion. Ezra miller would’ve been perfect if he wasn’t a s**t person"
This is all Amber Turds fault 😡😡😡
who up willying they wanka rn
L
"Willy Woke, looks terrible"
Omg I sooooooooo want to see this looks awesome... Finally a good movie
This looks bad imo
"HUGH LAURIE, not Hugh Grant.
Dr. House."
"Finally! Another Movie I want to see. First Oppenheimer. Second Barbie. Now third, Wanka."
I’ll watch it even though he’s dating a Kardashian
Dont remake it. Just don't. 🤦
Really? Timothee dude as wonka?🙄🙄🙄
"I just can't, after gene wilder and johnny d? Nah.
    Honestly, I expected them to cast like Jaden Smith as Willy Wonka 😂😂😂"
I can't believe it's taken this long
Anotha one
Is dead on arrival
Nope
Negative not even five seconds into the trailer and I’m turned off
It will never ever ever be like the original
"Wow I can’t wait to see Wonka Begins: The Imaginening. We’re finally getting our introduction to the Wonkaverse.

Actually scratch that and reverse it, this looks like a steaming heap of Oompa Loompa droppings."
Scissorhands was original and good without being twistedly weird. Maybe this can erase the dumpster fire that  Burton & Depp created. And lead to another chapter everyone can enjoy.
Ew no
*DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING**DING*
JUST ME OR DOES THE PERSON PLAYING WILLY WONKA LOOK LIKE REGULUS BLACK?!
Dune!
eww
💩💩💩
Can't wait to see this love Timothee Chalamet.
I wouldn't say I like it when the workers are mean to Willy. They're jealous because he's about to become the greatest chocolate in the factory's history.
"Uh oh, remember what the maga crowd did when there was a black Ariel? oh boy......"
"at first i was like nahh, then when i seen the picture and now the character in motion, all i could think about was seeing a young gene wilder but then the music kicks in and then we have hugh grant as a oompa loompa.......i need to see this movie"
0:25 Kween Mathilda reference lmaooo😭😭😭😭
Meh...I'll take the Gene Wilder version over any of these other versions!
Why are the slaves so much smaller in this film?
Why do they keep remaking this?!??!
"The way he says his lines makes me physically wince. If those were the best takes they got, I'd love to see the worse ones."
A kardashiam is now willy wonka smh.. unreal.. only in america we idolize whores
Him and Tom Holland are my favorite actors ❤️❤️❤️❤️
idk how much willy I can wonka anymore
"I'm sure it'll be a good movie, but I do think that there movies about reall life candy makers!

People like Milton Hershey and H. B. Reese!"
I think this will be a good movie. I like how it shows us how optimistic Willy was before he went completely crazy. Yeah he’s a little insane in this one but I think it makes for a nice prequel movie. I think they definitely picked the right actor to play Willy wonka
anybody wonking their willy rn?
I hop to see this movie ❤❤
talk about missing the entire point of the original novel.
Oh no this looks so bad.
I’m taking my nieces and nephews to go watch this when it comes out
"oh boy, more uninspired trash... boy am I excited."
"I'm so happy Disney is not involved in this movie!
Ty Warner Brothers!"
This looks like utter garbage
Looks woke
johnny depp with anorexia
What i didn’t know mr bean will be in this movie as priest
"Americans trying to sound more ""british and dignified"" is something that should be illegal"
Nope
Gk ada duit mau nonton aku
"I'm excited for Gene Wilder's evil capitalist origin story, honestly. I'll be watching it as such."
"As a stand alone, sure.. As a Gene Wilder prequel, seems to over the top to be it. The original was grounded more then this goofy feeling harry potter universe movie."
"Come with me,and you’ll be in a world of pure imagination."
Why did they remake again??? We don’t need another Willy Wonka movie!auuuuugh.
Absolute AIDS!
I hate hollywood
0:20 THAT’S ALYSSA EDWARDS
"@/tv/ He's everywhere because women like him, and women watch more tv than men now. Get over it, dweebs."
"When this trailer came on in my theater, these group of girls all screamed “TIMMY!!” It was hilarious 😂 I’m so excited for this movie."
:O Finally! AHHHHHHH now im excited!
"the 2005 one was enough , why this, waste of time"
per usual another musical that gets disguised as a straight drama in its trailer...what is so scary about song and dance?
Just be grateful Disney isn’t making this film
"When Wonka said ""Make it so"" He warped into chocolate history"
Daniel Thrasher really stepping out of his element here.
he’s making chocolate of course
"I have always enjoyed this book, a very different version, a good trailer, Well done all for this production."
AGAIN?
The 2nd willy wonka look better
WE CANT HAVE THIS ON EARTH ITS CURSED!
I just know 0:06 will be used for Crimson River edits
I was excited to see this movie but when i was there is no jhonny depp i was 😢
Tim chalamet is channeling the spirit of gene wilder in ths movie.
Mrs. Brown from Paddington is in it!
1:18 is a Freemason reference with Wonka standing in the middle of the North Star Polaris which is Lucifer btw and the people rotating around him as the stars rotate around Polaris unbelievable they just can’t stop
Ever since I saw Katya say “I’m making chocolate of course” was Alyssa Edward’s… I can’t unsee it lmao
Soulless dreck.
I AM SOOO WATCHING THIS FOR MAT BAYNTON AND SIMON FARNABY MY KINGS
Everytime they remake a movie it gets worse
"Too many black peepo , i'll pass"
I'm a fan of Charlie and the chocolate factory movie i love that character of willy Wonka act by Jonny Depp his acting was superb i wish to see Johnny depp as Willy Wonka again ❤
I hope this movie is a musical movie 🎵🎶🎼🎵🎶🎼🎵🎼🎶🎵🎶🎼🎵
Hmmm ..... no
"Wow, looks great!"
this is going to get AWFUL reviews like less than 6.5 on iMDB 💀
literal chills when he says its wonkin time
how many willy wonkas there gonna be
1:34 it’s the horrible histories guy!!
Looks awful. Such a miscasting.
Am I the only one sick of remakes? Just create new stories damn
That looks very interesting and delicious. That’s gonna be the best Wonka movie ever!
What makes no sense to me is didn't wanka have human employees until he shut it down? So why not just cast human people for the beginning of his career but 🤷🏽‍♀️
I can’t wait for this
This movie looks trash and terrible then the original
Mr bean
0:18 an alyssa edwards cameo.
Man like modded controller 360 🎮
"Lsplash come get your damn spider... 




It's making chocolate"
Mr Bean voice at 1:43 ha ha
What an abomination of willy wonka
Before Charlie Buckets dreams came true...there was a time when Willy Wonka's dreams came true.
Wait did mr bean just talk😅😅
0:19 - Alyssa Edwards
0:18 He really does sound like Alyssa Edwards 😂 “I’m makin’ chocolate of course! For the friends family fans and the folks at home”
Can’t wait to see how this affects the snowpiercer theory
"I can see why this has such a huge dislike ratio and has already flopped. It the unrealistic, forced casting of minorities and their forced inclusion in every single scene. Us western natives are tired of this constant attack on our culture and our people. Movies, like adverts, are leftist weapons used to normalize and brainwash the populace into accepting globalism, the end goal of the elites who control leftists."
Why
"From the flute to the Oompa Loompa, I guess this is a prequel to the 1971 film. Timothy is giving some Gene Wilder vibes."
"No, no, no, it’s called “Wiily Wonka and the Chocolate FACTORY”, not “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate…” sigh… never mind."
Corporate greed at its finest.
To the tribute of Gene Wilder. 🥹🥲☺️🍫
I always like to watch such movie really movie watching feeling
พดาหล
Remake wonka again? Run out of idea?
"Why?

You realize the first movie only exists because someone came up with an original idea, right? Dahl wasn't trying to recapture the nostalgia of the movie that was going to be made - he just wrote a story. Maybe you should try it sometime."
Is this the origin story?
Where's the bit from the book where he smuggles the oompa loompas in shipping containers and makes them work for chocolate?
Jhonny depp  was 🔥
The problem here is some people find his performance is cringe? Anything else? The set looks amazing tho
"""Pinky promise"" art heist baby reference"
Mr bean awww
What's next? Pirates of the Caribbean is the latest installment in the sci-fi/thriller genre? I'm looking forward to
"Before Wonka opens a factory, he was making chocolate"
This movie tells the story of how Willy Wonka becomes a chocolatetier
looks EXACTLY like daniel thrasher
Even the little girl is chocolate
"Looks amazing. Just a heads up, I was just curious, I find WB's ethics lacking, so I cannot give you my money. I really wanted to see this."
Im so excited
Looks like NBA youngboy
Hollywood needs original ideas
Hugh Grant? God forbid movie studios give little people opportunities for employment
Who be wonkan thier willy?
"Remakes, remakes, remakes...Come witness the death of imagination, originality and good writing."
1:42 is that mr bean ? shouting run away
I'm crying already and it's just the trailer
i want to see to this soonnnnn
"This Christmas, get Wonked."
Just stop. No one will come close to Gene Wilder.
Very bad
Looks like this one goes to the fudge room.
Barf. Looks atrocious.
0:21
0:20
I have to say I like that kid though.

thanks for the preview. now i know i don't wanna watch this. it's like that smelly thing floating in your toilet.
I think they are deleting any negative comments.
I don't know. I kinda wish they would just leave stuff alone now.
"Chocolate Cartel? Are they throwing their families in vats of acid?? How has he gone venturing around the world for 7 years he’s barely looking 25

I feel bad that this movie was made."
"I prefer my chocolate with lots of SPICE, hold the sand, in it LOL"
"just go watch rik mayall reading georges marvelous medicine, you'll enjoy it much more"
I love that all comments love something about that and I can't say if they're ironic or not
"And so it begins...
The Wonkaverse! 🍫"
"So you telling me Wonka could figure out flying chocolate but not Fizzy Lifting drinks? (And no, that's not my only problem here 🤣)"
"0:26 some body come get her she dancing like a
Edit and 1:48"
"great, another nostalgia bait"
"So maybe this is a prequel? Cuz the whole reason Wonka chose an heir was to replace him cuz he realized he was aging, but he's pretty young here."
Did i just spot Mr bean in the trailer?
Can’t have a new movie without a little black girl and scenes depicting the church in a negative way. Probably written by a rabbi. Pass
"Looks promising, even Hugh Grant is here"
"The lead actor thinks he can be Johnny Depp, but little does he know that there has been and will be *only one Johnny Depp in the cinema industry!!!*"
Please have the some “In a World of Your Imagination” even if it is just in the end credits that is like the Willy Wonka song and it would fit this movie so well
There is a problem this one follows the 70s adaptation as a prequel wasn't the 2005  the better adaptation? Wasn't the 70s the reason why there was no adaptation for so long? This feels like an insult to the man who wrote the book by bringing up the 70s film he hated so much
Charlie and the chocolate factory was better
Stop making origin stories of existing franchises.
Rowan will always possess Mr. Bean in him.
Rowan will always possess Mr. Bean in him.
Charlie Bucket was suppose to be Black. Glad they added a Black child this time.
"the story of the god of chocolate.











Willuis Wonkala"
0:33 honestly chocolate 🍫 corporations act like cartels anyway so this is realistic when you think about it.
"Remakes and reimagined films used to be rare, now it’s the norm & original films are rare."
"""From the Director of Paddington"" - You dont have to say more. Iam in."
Pass
"Hope they give the oompa a potty mouth now that would be pretty funny, but they too chicken to make an oompa fierce 😂"
Willy Wonka and his terrible purpose.
New Wonka Chapter ❤
I need the crazy johnny depp Wonka
I see mr.bean and im amazed
"""The producer of harry potter"""
Maybe a prequel on willy wonkas backstory?
Wonking time
This won't touch Gene Wilder's version of Wonka.
Call me old but Depp's wonka is the best
I love it when they make these kind of origin stories
2:19
I AM SO EXICTED
AGAIN
"So bad. His voice is not it, the acting is not it."
I'd prefer it animated
I'm waiting for reviews til I watch this
I miss Gene Wilder
Is that Paterson Joseph from Peep show? Jesus!!!!!
Looks like the pie shop in Pushing daisies
I hope the chocolate is being made with certified cocoa under rainforest alliance.
Depp was a failure as Wonka and it was still a great movie. I am looking forward to seeing this on the Imax in the Spring of 2023. BRING IT.
they could’ve found a batter actor for wonka
England is looking very...diverse.
"🥱🥱… oohh… more bland, brainless and uninspired rehashed classics… 🤔 But, i thought that was Disney's job! Line-up, sheep! 😄"
Ahh! Miss you Johnny
Wonka kid is no Johnny Deep!
Manifesting
Timothee💪💪
Another one!?!?!!
"You coulda done the great glass elevator and been super original
But you picked THIS?!
:/
Meh."
Not feeling it….😢
They cant seem to leave classics alone.
"Looks bad, sorry! No to TC for this one."
I have a feeling people are gonna watch this along with The Color Purple instead of WB’s own Aquaman 2.
this looks like a big flop. and willy wonka acted by some kid with no acting skill jesus
"Good actors, but I'll probably skip this version."
does this tie in with any of the previous movies
cringe
Not sure what the point is of this remake. Johnny Depp surpassed Gene Wilder but this is pure aimed at hitting diversity targets….nothing more.
I don't feel that he is weird enough for some reason. I haven't watched any movie with this actor before and I have grown up watching the Johnny Depp version which I loved as a child. I really hope it turn out to be a good movie
Noo way the new willy Wonka after decades
Muad'dib! Muad'dib! Muad'dib! !!
Looks dreadful
Willy Wonka is just Saw with kids. I hope this is R
Another????? JUST STOP
mrbean:Run away
"_Paul Atreides dreams about his time on heaven world of Caladan, while eating dust on Arrakis._"
I bet this movie will be release in 3D
"Can't wait for this to get review bombed because of the glaring elephant in the room. Charlie is a little white boy, not a little black girl. Just another example of how to f*ck it up, brought to you by Hollywood. 👏👏👏👏👏"
"Oh WOW! A remake movie that has no correlation to original story and goes route of  ""The main guy takes minority hire companion his side to fight *EVIL* capitalists"" OMG!! how original.. this never done before last 10 years over and over and over and over again.. totally not!! 

Hollywood become ""STOP Sign"" that where you see everywhere exact same thing except, because it is in other side of the road they think they made something new. no thanks."
"I'll watch the movie just for one man  MR BEAN ❤
Love From India 🇮🇳"
"I winced watching this. Grew up on Wilder's version, thought Depp's wasn't good, and from the looks of this it doesn't look good either. How about bringing us new stories, Hollywood, instead of rummaging through your drawers to re-sell old stories in ever less-enjoyable ways?"
Looks like something that has the same color as chocolate.💩
Johny Depp in heart ❤
Worried bout direction of this movie…..
Timothy failed the role💔
i can smell crimson rivers edits already
🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮 walt Disneyland again 🤮🤮🤮🤮
"Another stupid movie, yawnnnn."
The guy at 0:30 is Arther Slugworth
. . . What?
"Movies always have to be rewritten now so that is Black-ified, Asian-ified or Latino-fied😂😂😂 NEEEXXT"
Who keeps giving Timothy lead roles? Hes weakkk
"He's a fanstastic actor but I am surprised they chose Timothee Chalamet to play Willy Wonka. I thought the would select someone older like a Hugh Grant or Robert Downey Jr,."
I would rather eat at Arby’s then go see this
Creep
After he invented chocolate that gives him immortality. He become a Atreides and rule Arakis.
Yikes
"Man cant wait to see Willy Wonka  and that kid get trapped in some room and escape and almost drown in chocolate

Definitely a reason why to watch that movie!"
"Based on real events, I got fat due to chocolate."
If only wonka was johny deep
msmojo sent me
This looks like fun!
"Oh, thank god. For a minute there, I thought we weren't going to suffer our diversity quota."
diabet man
"It is widely believed that Gene Wilder's performance as Willy Wonka in the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" film was exceptional and set a high standard that seems impossible to surpass. While Johnny Depp's portrayal in the 2005 remake was a commendable effort, it failed to match Wilder's performance. The prospects of the upcoming remake appear unpromising, but only time will reveal its true potential."
something doesnt feel right about timothy playing willy wonka but i wont judge until i watch it
"You know what would be a great idea. People would dress up in brown, bring lots of chocolate, and eat it whole watching the movie!

Or dress up as Oompa Loompas.

Similar to the Minions 2 trend."
Just thinking about that time Janelle Monae cosplayed as Wonka…😔🤌🏽
Where is rowan atkinson?
"I still use Gene Wilder’s Wonka line of “strike that, reverse it.”

It made me sad that it turned into “scratch that…”"
Johnny Depp wouldve been perfect
i like the old one better.
Gene Wilder is tripping over a cane in his Grave right now!
Опять негры там где их недолжно быть
"Ahhh 30 million views on a movie that hasn't been released yet, 🤯spoiler super 😉😎"
How many times do you think you should remake the same movie?
So where is white Charlie? We only see a black girl? Or does blacks thinks it's ok to replace white with blacks in another movie? You replaced white Peter Pan with a black Peter Pan. You replaced a white April O'neal with a black April O'Neal... why does blacks thinks it's ok replace white actors with black actors?
"For some reason, I thought he was Daniel Thrasher"
Why does he have no facial expressions?
"He doesn't seem right for the role... Ever since Katya said that Timothée Chalamet playing Willy Wonka is just Alyssa Edwards, I can't get it out of my head! XD"
This is just amazing! I wonder if they'll show us how he had the mind of attempting to kill children.
Are they deleting the negative comments.
I knew it would be a charming film when he said “wonk two will wonkers for a will wonker of a wonk time
"wonka, such a silly devious mischevious dubious name"
"Forced nostalgia, childish jokes, inauthentic plot...yep defiently adding this to my watch list."
I love Depp version but this not look bad.
"Why are they redoing this again
Yuck"
2:04
“Wonka” More Like “Wonky”
this looks awful.
shame
Chocolate Girl
Yo it's Daniel Thrasher! Can't believe he's in a movie now
This is based on a true story right?
A very long candy ad just in time for Christmas.
"*terrible Gene Wilder impression*
""Scratch that reverse it :D""
I just threw up in my mouth"
this is NOT an insane man like the past two.
"Um, no"
I cant tell if this is a reboot or a prequel to Charlie
ITS COMING ON MY BRITHDAY!
Come with me you will see in a world of pure imagination
Timothy as Wonka … nah. Like his work but he’s not witty enough imo. They needed to find a true oddball.
Paddington cast?
Why is he ALWAYS American!!
ROWAN ATKINSON!?!??!?
This is a much watch i need to see the oompa loompa dance😂
timothee chalamet is as whimsical as batman
i want rekha shankars jilly jonka on the big screen
Oo I see what's going on . They're gonna merge it with the Harry Potter universe.
So there’s no Charlie bucket and etc?
"Another film ruined by the George Floyd incident and white people's derangement for ""equity"""
Plonker
"This is gonna flop harder than the Depp one, because it least that one was WEIRD."
"Nope, nope,nope,nope.....Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka...I love Johnny Depp but he sucked...i like Chalamet but some things should stay sacred."
"I hope this age of hollywood crashes and burns and some new lads step in. These directors are too scared to take a risk so they cannablise great old movies, and sanitize it removing anything complex so anyone can understand it at surface level."
Casting diarrhea.
"I just don't get why everything is a subpar remake or prequel nowadays, have we just run out of interesting and creative ideas?"
So quiet up and listen down🤓👇
"Lol, the Hugh Grant bit was funny 😂"
"I liked the sequel better, Snow Piercer"
This movie looks terrible they should have made this an original because this actor is terrible at portraying gene wilders Willy wonka
Booo
i think this one stays true to the Gene wilder version
"I Cringed, I Cried, I laughed a total of zero times, Truly a breath of fresh air, and a Solid 3 out of 10 movie."
"POR MAS NUEVAS  VERSIONES NUEVAS DE WILLY WONKA Q SE HAGA, JAMÁS SERÁ COMO LA IMPECABLE VERSIÓN Q LOGRÓ TIM BURTON Y JONHY DEEP."
sCrAtCh ThAt
People are so dramatic I’m sure it won’t be horrible. I don’t think he was right for this movie because he’s a little too « normal » but i’ll still watch it and I like how it doesn’t have much in common with the first one. Original
Hope Gene Wilder Will be so proud of him
Roald Dahl is rolling in his grave
Why are none of the comments about how pissed every dwarf actor is about them not casting dwarves as the oompa loompas? Erasing representation by trying to not look ableist really backfired
This is the way to leverage the past great movie/s. Unlike Snow White. Looks good. Will take my kids to watch this as they love Willy Wonka.
Pi can tell this is gonna be a Christmas box office breaker.
"OMGGGGG, IM SOOOO INGSIDED FOR THIS TO COME OUTTT😁😁😁😁"
0:24 never had insane chocolate I’ll take it.
rubbish
Bleh.   Dosen’t look good at all.
You know you're getting old when they've made two remakes and you still prefer the first.
If Willy wonka had a pussi:
I’m surprised they didn’t make Wonka black 😂😂😂
looks like a solid film although idk abt the canoninity
Another classic ruined..
Did we really need a willy wonka origin story
Ironic that this movie is coming out in the same month as Godzilla minus-one
#NotMyWonka
"Oh my God, this looks terrible"
woof.. that dude is not willy wonka.
Chalamet's performance as far as I can tell here comes off as very forced. He's trying too hard to be quirky and eccentric and it feels unnatural
Holy was not expectig such an amazing ensemble! I definitely will be watching this
Where’s the part where Willy Wonka ashes a cigarette on the peons sitting a section over from him
What happen to wonka’s hair 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
"I might have to give this one a look! I don't think any remake would top the original, but it appears for more entertaining than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, which was a true disgraced to the movie."
"Timothée Chalamet is a very good but one-note actor. I get he's the ""go-to"" lead actor right now in Hollywood but I really don't see him shining in this role."
1:03  is that rowan atkinson? OMG!
Cant wait to see this Snowpiercer Prequel.
I had no idea Mat Baynton was in thissss!! Horrible Histories nostalgia for life lol.
"The film we don't need but the one we want more than ever. Pretty much in a sense, lol."
No. Just no.
Thanks - I hate it.
I WANT A WONKA BAR SO BADLY!!?!????!!!!
sad that the girl in the film gets eaten by a Vermicious Knid.
😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣 another crackhead movie 😂🤣😭😂🤣
am i the only one that thinks timothee isn’t fit to this role. his acting feels kinda wooden to me. he fits drama roles more
Johnny Depp as Wonka is still the best Wonka.
"I pray this will be the adaptation to FINALLY reveal the Hornswogglers, Snozzwangers, and Whangdoodles onscreen!"
"Is it wrong to say I came into this trailer hoping for something more in line with the book like the Charlie movie was, and less in line with that less faithful movie from the 60s or so?"
Grant has come full circle
Who up wonking their willy rn
So this is what Paul Atredes is seeing when tripping on spice on Arrakis.
"This looks bad, he’s too young with not enough charm to play this part. Just seems like a highschool play version."
i got goosebumps
Ive been watch the first movie that played by johnny deep. And now i want to watch this movie because there are hugh grant and rowan atkinson too. It Might be good movie.
But why.
"Honestly, I'm just so excited to see the Wonka movies back in the industry."
Bro sounds like the Onceler
So all this movie is going to be is a bunch of british people saying CHOCLETE? I'm out.
So... it's a prequel to both films at once? Is that brilliant or crazy...or both? I don't know what to think. 🧐
"Okay, I'll be honest. I did not have high hopes before. But now I do. This looks like a lot of fun"
"No matter what will happen in this movie, always remember that it's not the little girl who gets the factory, it's Charlie"
"Why is wonka not a transgender socialist poc? This is the current year, you know!"
WHY IS IT CALLED WONKA? STUPID NAME. WHY DO THEY KEEP SHORTENING THE NAMES OF CLASSIC FILMS ITS CALLED CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY. IE PADDINTON BEAR - PADDINGTON
they almost compressed the whole movie in the trailer.. how disappointing. who needs excitement and imagination.. eh?
He doesn't fit this role. This feels forced haha
It is my younger age and full of dream when 1st time I met Willy Wonka…so when I hear it again of course definitely would see it
1:41
🎬
0:08 best line
looks like Warner Bros is going woke too
Жопка
"*""With great chocolate comes great responsibilities.""* immediately reminded me of that one Larry Boy short."
"Gonna be honest, I don't know about this one boys"
Am I the only one who thinks this looks kind of by the numbers and a little cringy from a writing standpoint?
Maybe the second trailer will be better
The oompa loopas were originally slaves
Heisenberg
willy wonka
I think he's perfect. It's Willy when he was younger. Back when all he had to his name was a dream and a thousand people trying to crush said dream. This was before his magical factory and world-renowned candy.
Is this a prequel?
"Wilder is, was and always will be the best Wonka ever"
Originality is dead and we killed it
"nope, let's walk it back. there's 0 charm to this movie"
"Timmy being one of the best actors in the industry, and fuc*ing Kylie Jenner. 

Boy is living the dream"
Timothy doesnt feel the right casting for wonka.
What the…😅?
I cried when we found out his black friend wasnt even a real girl but an artificial one made of chocolate .
looks meh....
"Why they always can add a black into any narrative,that’s amazing right?"
Wonka movie is about the childhood and teen hood years of willy wonka
"Looks terrible, but I'll watch it anyway. I've been wrong before, I hope I'm wrong again. I LOVE the original. NEVER plan to see JD play Wonka.. I really like this cast.❤"
He looks like one of the kids visiting the factory not Willy Wonka.
I wonder why no one touches the Jetsons?
"ah yes, the iconic black girl from willy wonka. what"
👏👏👏👏
"Ugg. Could be worse, though. Imagine if Tim Burton remade it with Johnny Depp as Wonka - that would be fu - wait, he what?"
I love johnny
Cringe
esperando wonka!!!
"Can’t wait; like if you agree!



9-10-2023 158p"
This is dishonest filmmaking
Kaaash there is jhonydeep in wonka charactor
I can’t wait!
Ding ding ding
"Жопка
Ха"
"Cringe
Also, lmaoing at making Oompa Loompas into cgi shrunk down healthy people, so as to not offend midgets, even though casting real midgets gives them jobs, thus supporting them"
mga totoong anghel yun bat nawala
nawawala phillipines sa smurf pinaliwanag nila na nawawala yung philippines sa listahan ni santa gawa nang naaksidente
I prefer johnny depp before as Wonka
"Disastrous.
ESG cancer"
"House Atreides will finally have a chocolate factory, after all."
That l👀ks fun!
Dude this fake his dad does not have beard fakeeeeeeee and also Willy wonky do not be friends with one child one child i sayyyyy!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂
nope scratch that reverse it
Oooo. No.
I just found out the original character of Charlie Bucket was written as black by Roald Dahl. Where’s all the outraged comments underneath all the other remakes.
why did they make this
He is damn cute!
Seeing Rowan Atkinson running & screaming is the only reason I will be watching this film 😂😊
ITS BACK! ITS FINALLY BACK!
Loganberry 😂❤🎉
Glad to hear that this movie will not follow the original book written in 1964 where the Oompa Loompas were enslaved Africans.
More WOKE BS.
waiting 😻
Is this the same warner bros. making the harry potter series?
"Learn many recipes, including CHOCOLATE"
"Oooooh, I'm so excited! THANKS WARNER BROS.!"
"Katya refering Alyssa Edward when Wonka say "" I making chocolate of course "" 💀"
"visually, chalamet works but his voice.... its just not working. bro needs more sarcasm and a tinge of weirdness"
"I am actually very excited to see this…honestly at first I had no clue how Timothy would be…but it looks great!! The reason I say that about him is just because a huge part of his character in film, for me, is how I portrayed him from Call Me by Your Name… actors are a glorious phenomena..truly ♥️"
How can I unsee Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
This looks and feels souless.
Something is just off about wonka’s dialogue and delivery. Gonna predict that the Depo version will still be the best Willy Wonka
Did they seriously have to add black characters in a Victorian setting…?
😃👍🏻
they sad timothy chalamet sounds like alyssa edwards in this and i can't unhear it
ding ding ding
"Bruh favorite line is ""So quiet up and listen down. Nope. Stratch that. Reverse it."""
Noo.
Realy after two great.......
“i’m making chocolate of course” as alyssa edwards
I love how all the comments are positive. I can’t wait to not watch this movie! ❤
wait a second this looks decent
I love Willy Wonka but the thing I’m most excited about in this movie is watching Rowan Atkinson. I’ve missed him in movies. I don’t know why these days he’s not in that much movies
casting is a mess !
This looks awful
"Imma go on my bday, idc what these peeps say, its not goin. To be bad, you can not predict, you haven't seen it. Btw try the new wonka magic hat gummies they are bussin'"
Who up wonkin they willy rn
"I’m not hating on timothée chalamet being Willy Wonka, but could you imagine Jeremy Allen White being the young Gene Wilder???"
comments are def being deleted lmao this looks maaad cringe
this looks like doo doo garbage
Blueberry girls should run because im going golfing
"For multiple reasons (the main one being that I just cannot see Timothée Chalamet pulling off Willy Wonka's crazed lunatic vibe), I don't see this being a good movie, but man I really hope it is."
Wonka  needs to be someone a little more silly with an askew personality
"Couldn't even get ""Strike that... Reverse it."" right."
"I feel like I’m in the twilight zone. 

All of the comments I can see,are overwhelmingly positive…. and I’m over here thinking I would rather get an enema than have to sit through this movie. 😂"
This movie looks horrendous
Not him saying “I’m making chocolate of course” like Alyssa Edwards 😂😂😂
I love all these 100% original and not shamelessly rehashed movies being put out these days
They be deleting negative comments huh
This looks… horrible. :(
"I cannot wait, wait, WAIT to see this prequel movie! I'm getting really excited and watching the trailer all the time.😀"
0:17 alyssa edwards
Can they not stop ruining classics or start making new ones? Hollywood sucks.
Love Wonka and Tim but something seems off about his performance.
"WE DONT NEED IT , please STOP 😭😭😭"
I don’t know about all of this
he looks 13 years old but ok
I loved it when willy added spice melang to chocolate and became the kwitsatz-wonker one of the moment in movie history.
“I’m making chocolate ofc” -Alyssa Edwards 💀 ty to Katya for pointing this out
You all need to stop praising this. We don't need them putting this back in theatres after we escape its tendrils.
This looks like fookin shite❤
"This actually seems brilliant, like truly…… it feels like it has heart and sole"
please dont
Lol katya brought me here 😂
"I personally will not watch this film to protest how disrespectful this movie is  . Hugh grant is does not have dwarfism and if you really think about it this just physical version of what blackface is . Literally no different. Shameful, so wrong"
"I really hoped that Douglas Hodge would appear at least as a cameo since he played as Willy Wonka in the awesome Charlie & the Chocolate Factory musical and many other classics, but seeing Jim Carter is just as exciting to see considering I grew up with Downton Abbey. I may just give this a shot and hope the songs & interactions will be good at least."
"Chalamet really phoned this one in, eh?"
bruh
Looks absolute shite
"We didn't need another Willy Wonka film, Johnny Depp already perfected it"
"Pliss aku nonton ini habis liat video dia sama Kylie jenner ciuman, rasanya kek gak Della kenapa harus sama Kylie si napa gak sama yg singgle aja si😢"
"Hugh grant as oompa loompa is not  something  I wanted


 and also not needed.ugh"
om mwaking chwoclit
whyyyyyyyyy 😢
"Another movie we didn’t know we needed. 
 Because we don’t need it."
This is gonna be epic!!!!
I don't think they casted Willy wonka correctly
"If they don't have a cameo of a young grandfather from the original, I'm walking out."
"*Scratch* that, reverse it?!?! 0:12"
"Oh wow... If the trailer is any indication, this ""movie"" is gonna be teeeeeerrible"
This looks horrendous.
this looks sooooo bad how can they do this to my boy willy. Also timmy is a good actor but hes being crucified by these shite roles.
This actually looks....ok? Like I'm shocked to say this but this looks really whimsical and fun
He does look like a young Gene Wilder.
Oh this is unfortunately the cutest thing I’ve ever seen
"Katya brought me here...
""i'M mAkInG cHoCoLaTe oF cOuRsE"""
future classic in the making
T_T this is gonna be great!
This looks BAD 😂
I hope it's good.
say what you want but this definitely has magic I think he will Honor Gene Wilder not just try to copy him I hope it does well it looks solid
"Came here from Trixie and Katya podcast, ""I'm making chocolate of course"" 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
Oh so. It's like Chocolat but less Roma people and more British people and telling Willy Wonka's origin? Weird flex but ok
no. absolutely not.
im only watching for Rowan fr
That sounded like Alyssa Edwards 😂
God this looks awful
Timothy sounds like someone else but I can’t put my finger on it
I want this twink obliterated
"Timotee shalamaladingdong,
the coc.. I mean the Remake/prequel destroyer 
Dune ✔️
Willy wonka ✔️
Armie Hammer’s testicles✔️
Who’s next ?
*original movies shaking in their boots 😰"
im sorry but he doesnt fit the role of willie wonka
"Lmao, this ratio is amazing 🤣 ‘I’m makin chocolate of course’ let’s see if this movie breaks even"
ugh
1:02 Is that Rowan Atkinson?!?!
so this timothe chalome decided to finally cash out
"""I am Making chocolate of course.""
-Katya Zamo"
I think this . Film will be.. Good. It would in. The. Cinmar  itlooksgoodtogo. And see this. Is the. New one. Film of Willey wonka. Rebekah 🎄
"Warner Brothers you're killing the legacies of so many talented artists with your trash cashgrab biopics and milking of existing franchises.
One of the pillars of capitalist dystopia is the industrialization of art. You're the leading culprit right now."
Recast him now💀
JUST RELEASE ALREADY
if paddington was on its good
"When black willy wonka ?!!

All willy wonka movies have white dudes. Representation matters bro."
hold on there is something wrong with this how can they make him a guy?
Katya brought me here! 🤣
who's here because of Katya? hahaha
*Alyssa Edwards voice* I'm makin chahwklet a couRse!
"The last part had me.  Particularly that specific actor as an oompa lompa. 
Just take it as a parody of the original."
ugh. No
Chalamet isn't right for the role
0:06 👀
There should be penalties in real life on daydreaming 😂 would save so much time
If you came here from Trixie & Katya: 0:17
This was awful.
"I hope I’m wrong, but I don’t think I’m going to like it."
Who up wonking their willy
"meme lines, why"
Finaly after all this years
I’m so excited to see that movie in Christmas and I think that this one vill would be one of best new Christmas movies in this year 😆😍❤️
Why are we making a prequel of the Willy Wonka Ronald Dahl despised? The whole reason the family agreed to make Charlie and the Chocolate was to make those wrongs a right. 2005's Charlie and the Chocolate is still one of the most well-adapted movies from a book.
Willy Woka and the Redundant Remake Factory.
"Stunning how he delivers lines with almost no pizazz at all. 
English actor but putting on American accent to play an ambiguous English American character 
Ahhh and a normal size actor playing a role that was for little people but using cgi to make him small. 
There is a lot wrong with this."
"WOW, NORMALLY I would say this is going to bomb harder that Hiroshima, but I said the same thing about the Barbie movie, so I'm just going to step back and watch the chaos and see who's left standing"
This is an abortion of an abomination as all modern rehashings are
"""willy Wonka, the orgin story""."
how many times is hollywood gonna tell the same story stoppppp
This young prat is supposed to compete with Gene Wilder. Sorry but no.
"Shoulda cast MGK or something instead, woulda been 10x less cringe"
"i always wondered how he trapped the oompa loompa race and forced them into slavery, gonna be a great movie!"
wonk
0:51 A double ha 😂:)
I’m gonna see this.
Was Rowan Atkinson the priest?
"probably gonna go see this movie because its on my birthday, looks cool, me like"
I wonder if the creator of this movie has Asperger’s Syndrome. 🤔
no thank you.
"I feel like..... Something is missing. I dont know. I'll watch the movie but I dont feel the hype I did when I watched, say, the trailer for Barbie."
He looks like timothy shalome x tubbo
Tim Tim really out here Wonkamaxxing
"I have mixed emotions about this film.... on one hand, it's great to see the backstory behind Willy Wonka and how he made the best Chocolate factory in the world (also  shows us a little bit more on how he met the Oompa Loompas).... but on the other hand, this just feels like a forced Cash-Grab"
Who up wonking they willy rn?
Next jd
i am so excited for thisss!! the trailer gives me a christmas vibe.
"When Wonka said ""It's Willy Time"" I felt that deep inside 💀"
Trash
I thought wonka was supposed to be middle aged?
This movie is gonna be very very good ☺️😁
"The casting is amazing except for hugh grant as the oopma loompa, they should've gotten a rounder actor, by which I mean round face, and the cgi is just too weird 2:08"
TIMOTHY IS PLAYING WILLY WONKA????
"Well, my friends, it looks like we’re about to be in a world of our imagination"
Can i please see some damn garland? Why release it in December if it's not Christmas themed?!
"i absolutely love timothee chalamet!  he’s a great actor and he’s definitely gaining a lot of traction these days. he’s very attractive, talented, humble and shy yet charming. i love watching all his roles and watching his acting career grow. i do hope he wins some awards and gets the recognition he deserves for all of his versatile roles. 💕"
Chocolate cartel.
One of the movies of all time
"I can't wait for him to say ""it's wonking time"" and he will wonk all over the place🥵😍🤤🤤"
American Hollywood fans try not to hype up cringe challenge (impossible)
Jus watched the whole movie
How many times are they going to remake this movie? Aren't there any new stories or ideas?
i want to scratch and reverse timothee chalamet's acting career
Wooohoooo Matt Baynton made it into the big Hollywood productions. 🥰🥰🥰🥰❤
Rowan Atkinson is as magical as Wonka.
This is hot garbage.
"ROWAN ATKINSON IS BACK?! how much are they paying him lol, he rarely does cameos. Also think he'd make a better wonka that timothy, he's just way to young."
"After I saw Rowan Atkinson running away and screaming, I can't wait to see it. I already like the cast."
I can see there's Mr.Bean inside the movie. He said: Run away!
something we didnt know we needed
"THE MODERN PREQUEL LOOKS LIKE ""WILLY WOKE-A & THE CRINGE FACTORY"" BECAUSE THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED OOMPA LOOMPA WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS INSULT TO THE DWARFISM ACTORS FOR NOT HAVING APPEARED IN THIS FILM... BUT THE 1971 PARAMOUNT PICTURES CULT CLASSIC FILM CALLED ""WILLY WONKA & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"" IS THE BEST, LOL! 🍫🎬🎥👎😂"
This is the most hot garbage movie trailer I've seen....
isnt wonka meant to be a villian?
"Who's still watching this... 3 weeks later?




Don't you hate it when someone asks this stupid question, on virtually any popular video, no matter how old it is? And don't you hate it even more when they hit the enter key just enough to make you click ""Read more"", only to discover that the secret punchline sucks? Unlike myself... it's the attention-challenged moron who typically does this."
Yikes
This will be the greatest Warner Bros. movie of all time!
I hate how William Wonka makes chocolate
"Okay, hear me out: Paul King is a master of his craft and the cast includes some major consistent talent. This could be really good."
Alan Johnson
"One problem about this trailer, already showed the entire movie"
Love wonka and timothee has a good look for the casting but his delivery of the lines just seems cringey and forced. We’ll see how the final product turns out
This one trailer gave me diabetes… I’m not complaining.
The black member of the Chocolate Cartel is Sluggworth
As soon as I saw Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant are in this movie I added it to my watch list. This is gonna be awesome 😎
This looks terrible and embarssing
"So glad this is coming out at xmas.

Something about this feels like it embodies the same magic felt during xmas season."
Old wiley Wonka factory movie I love it 😊
А чего эти лампа лампы такие маленькии?
The main character ruins it for me
I wonder if WB pays for all of these positive bot comments or if these are genuine NPCs?
ENOUGH ALREADY: Come up with something new for once you parasites.
This should have been a Johnny Depp role. Johnny will eternally be the iconic Willy Wonka.
The origin story of a maniacal murderer. This looks to be the spiritual successor to Joker.
Too many remakes and very few originals
Who up wonking they willy rn
It's nice to see the OG Oompa Loompa design being used in this movie ngl
I like how theyre supporting dwarf actors by blacklisting dwarf actors.
1:02 bean
"To everyone who say this is a remake.
no, this is a prequel to the 1971's willy wonka."
This looks horrible. Idc. Jonny depps version was badd too.
"Looks like a satiated cringe mess. Its going to ingore all the dypopian messaging and go ""wow wacky billionaire is so cool and wacky, no problems here"" :/"
Nah…I’m good…
a wonka for the kids.
I love how Timothee plays wonka.
I humbly request that you stop resurrecting good properties only to destroy them.
2:02
why
Errrrr no thanks.
"*""Scratch* that, reverse it.""
I winced.  That is not the line.  _That.  Is.  Not.  The.  Liiine._

Also, who's this Little Orphan Annie chick?  She wasn't part of the original stories."
I am so ready to Willy my Wonka
T H I S  N E W S  I S  TOO  BIG!!
"God loves you and he wants to save everyone, but in order for him to do that, you need to repent and be baptized 🙏🏾❤️"
God loves you and he wants to save everyone 🙏🏾❤️
That was really woke. To woke for me.
"""So quiet up, and listen down. Nope, scratch that, reverse it"" The best line ever."
No thank you.
"Really, again?"
the trailer feels so magical✨✨
Why does he sound like Scott Disick
"Nah, the main actor dont fit in the role :'(((("
"Wonka in this one sounds more like, Jim Carey than Johnny Depp. But judging by the Oompa Loompa (spelling errors?) this is an original to the prequel. Strike that... Reverse it... Sounds fun anyway."
"hmmm he doesn't seem to have the ""crazy"" vibe that gene wilder and johnny depp.  he seems like a regular guy."
But...why
I love it 😂😂❤ I feel like I’m getting greatest showman vibes
So far so good. Let's hope they don't do another politically correct / woke remake.
1:08 Mr Moseby what are you doing here? 🩷🤣
Diversity in 1800s fantasy strikes again
"The comments are really not what I thought they'd be. Timothee seems really off in this role, dude is great but he just can't do whimsical and eccentric, it's hard not to see the acting here."
This is gud but Johnny depp in this role
I want this movie to be good but we all know deep down it won’t be 😢.. miss gene
Rowen akninson featured
"Wait, is that Mr Bean ??"
I never knew oompa loompa could breathe without oxygen.
This is the first time roald dahl had three movies of the same characters in a book
another soulless cash grab :(
Looks terrible. Weak lead actor
"Prediction before watching: All on screen ""white"" characters will not be ashkenazi Jews this time, but Sephardic Jews as the former are too ""white"" for Hollywood. Everyone else will be transformed into a black female character even though there were no blacks in England at that time. It will be a weak attempt at recapturing the magic whilst using corny one liners from the original as fan service whilst somehow trying to sledge straights, whites, males, and capitalism. Edit: 100% nailed it. Every. Single. Time. #TheNoticing"
I wish I was the part 😂
It’s really amazing I always wanna know Willie Wonka create the chocolate factory
"ah, yes, who could forget all the black people with normal and respectable jobs living in 1800s england. a time where even irish and scotish, people that look exactly like the english by the way, where not even considered white and were also considered less than human."
I am actually excited for this movie
They are running out of ideas🤮🗑️
This looks phenomenal!
looks pretty good
what
Anyone who disrespects this concept lives a wonderfully boring life of reaction videos and useless factoids
This is a prequel so its allowed to be cringe
He's not enough of a weirdo like Johnny Depp
Jeremy Allen White should be wonka
Johnny is Real Wonka
Judging by all the forced  characters they should've called it willy woka lol
This feels like it was supposed to be released in 2013
Hugh grant needs to retire he's creepy and old
Will be a trash movie.
This dork is the latest Hollywood plant they're trying to force feed us now
Mr.bean In Is Movie He in 1:41
White privilege
"""Here we go, Mama..."" gets each Mama going 100%"
wait so this is a remake and retelling of the book? because whatever happened to that black girl?
I expect this will be horrid. Chalamet is an atrocious actor. He ruined Dune and now they are disemboweling another classic. Apparently Zegler wasn’t available so they got a talentless beta boy instead. The modern “entertainment” industry needs to end.
"No Johnny Depp, massive L, no thank you."
"They should kept the name "" WOKE WONKA "" rather then "" WILLY WONKA ""..."
"He's no Gene Wilder, but I'm sure he'll be just fine."
bro is that keegan michael key lmfao
"I love how people don't care one bit that Roald Dahl would have so many problems with this, from the tone to the tale. Those things you will love, he would have hated."
"I don't know when we'll get the next trailer, but I bet PAW Patrol: The Mighty Movie would be a good place to show it. Don't you think? I mean, I bet the next trailer will showcase one of the songs or some songs sung in the background. What do you think would happen in the next trailer?"
As a Kid growing up w/ Willy Wonka and Chocolate factory this looks like it's gonna be good
bruh hollywood getting desperate when they making a wonka origins story wth is this trash
you made him bad
at least its not another remake
Wonka's got a chocolate girlfriend.
"Nobody asked for this, nobody wanted this."
Still wondering who asked for this...
"I love how they're trying to paint the Timøthÿe Çhäbeaubét as a race ally of some little black girl instead of collecting thousands of native amazonians (white people in redskin paint) and paying them in Cocoa Beans. 
They didn't even redesign the natives they just made them british 😂"
1:33 that is some bad cgi
Why does he randomly have a southern accent?
"The quote is ""Strike that, reverse it"". If you're going make a prequel to a beloved movie at least watch the original before you vomit up the script."
"Thirty million views, less than half a million likes, and practically nothing but positive comments sure bro😂"
"thanks, I hate it."
Too many black faces in 19 century clothes Funny
"M NOT WATCHING THIS TRASH , JOHNNY DEPP VERSION WAS WAAAY AMAZING AND BETTER 🤝🏼🤝🏼❤❤"
And those little guys with the orange skin and green hair is the dad
wait is willy wonka the little boy
i saw the mom from padington
BRO ITS SO COOL THAT IS FROM THE PADINGTON CREATERS
Can't wait to see how they write out the little black girl from Wonka's life to explain why we never heard of her later. XD
just watch the old one
I already hate Timothee Chalamet's performance in this movie based off of this trailer alone
I feel like the only one who thinks this looks good
NOOOOOO WHAT AN ERROR!!!! GUYS.... John Mulaney had come out rehab and it may sound like  ajoke but you KNOW he would have been the perfect Willy
This casting ain’t it
Wonka is a pedophile. Change my mind.
İ’m so excited for this movie 😊😊🎉🎉
lookin good
Looks like more memberberry slop.
This is already an abomination. Gene would never approve of this.
seems lika a nice movie to smoke a blunt
"This trailer remembers me "" Charle and the chocolate factory"""
Too many black folks in this film... will not be watching ... feels too woke
cringe
cringe
It’s crazy how all the “top comments” are positive when all the recent ones aren’t. This movie looks horrible and misguided… Timmothy should definitely stick to typecasting.
What a great idea to use her as a ingredient
Why is this necessary? This movie will hopefully bomb
Chalmet is really underacting
Looks ok but the sure are pushing the diversity. Just hope it doesn’t look forced.
RUN AWAAYYYY
"So in the last 10 years we've gotten a new movie of or based on:
Esio Trot
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Matilda
The BFG
The Witches

And Fantastic Mr Fox is still pretty fresh in everyones mind. 
Think we'll get another new movie based on one that's been made before or will we get one that hasn't been made before?
There's still:
The Giraffe, the Belly and Me
The Twits
The Magic Finger

haven't been adapted yet
Or will we get a new version of
James and the Giant Peach
or 
Danny The Champion of the world - though Wes Anderson's Fantastic Mr Fox had a nice reference to it"
"I like how this feels more like a prequel to the Gene Wilder version and NOT the horrible Johnny Depp version.

I don’t care if the Depp version is closer to the book. I read the book, and I don’t care. It just wasn’t as good."
"Not really what I was expecting, looks ok"
"Why though?  Just so we can have a little black girl be the main character instead of a little white boy?  Is that literally the only reason for this existing?  This doesn't look anywhere near as fantastical, and nobody is going to outdo Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp."
this looks awful
Ding ding ding ding
"i see what people mean when they say charlame's wonka isnt psyhotic enough, it doesnt feel like the same character as Wilder's or depp's"
Ridiculous.
"Just an overblown vehicle to give a group of ageing UK actors a hefty pay cheque. And as for Timothée Chalamet, he's no Johnny Depp. A piece of wood."
I wonked all over the screen 😩... #wonkforwonka
The adventures of Willy Atradies and Paul Wonka.
Rowan Atkinson screaming run awayyyy is too good too
Nailed the Oompa Loompa terrible dancing right there.... hope the movie does not devote so much time on them dancing...like in the last movie...
"So... This is the Gene Wilder Prequel, yes?  Why was nobody talking about the trailer for a month? I thought it was still in production."
"Tim Chalamet is getting alot of parts in films recently 
The kid isn't a bad actor,but why is hollywood just handing him all the good roles lol"
Hugh Grant dancing.... never thought i would say best Oompa lumpa dance ever.
"Harry Potter vibes, some back story, a new face that isn’t awkward like, I’m sorry to say, Johnny Depp"
This looks really bad
"Ronald Dahl was Robert Maxwell, Ghislaine's father. He also created Pergamon Press, one of the largest textbook publishers in the world. He was also a British spy."
Not a fan of Chalamet but it looks amazing
I was hoping it was going to be less Harry Potter and a bit more kinda darker in tone like Dune but with Wonka elements.
Ridiculous! Cinema will never be the same again....
Did i just see Mr bean in the trailer ?
Why is it so hard to maintain the originality of the movies?
Who else saw Timmothee chalamet and was like okay must watch
Who is this child
0:41 What do they have against daydreaming?
im excited for this movie but i was really hoping it would be a horror movie where he is a killer either way timothee chalamet is gonna kill it
"This is f'ing dumb and lazy asf! There was already a reboot and even though it wasn't as good as Gene Wilder's portrayal, it was at least unique. This rendition is pure garbage on every level. Too many plot holes, there's no funny characters and the casting choices are friggin terrible. Another classic bites the dust.😑 Why would Wonka act like and dress like the older version of himself while he is still a kid? Where is the development?!😠 People flying?! The original was WAAAAY more grounded then this nonsense."
"This looks like a cross between Fantastic Beasts and Hop. They really are never gonna get tired of pushing out remakes/spinoffs/prologues instead of creating actual original content, huh?"
i wont ever understand why a dwarf actor isnt  being cast as an Oompa Loompa seriously why not?
By far the best Willy Wonka reimagination . (And book detail recreation)
"Lame. Timothy is relevant, but he's certainly not as timeless as Gene. Or nearly as interesting as Johnny. And this trailer reflects that by showing us mediocre acting chops paired with tired mr magorium style antics, except not as visually exciting. Also let us remember that originally oompa loompas are tiny black pygmie slaves that were kidnapped ""from the deepest and darkest part of the African jungle"". Fun!"
Timothee hits different in our hearts...❤
Why wasn’t Willy Wonka recasted as a black woman for “modern audiences”? Is Hollywood tired of losing money?
😀😃🤩😅😅😅
I have never seen any actor acting as bad as Chalamet here. Maximum cringe
he went on to kill 5 children
lol this just looks bad
I'm definitely going to the movies for this 🥲🙌🏽💕💕🔥🔥🙌🏽🙌🏽
"Horrible acting from Timothee Chalamet, that was cringe, surprisingly"
Looks pants
Johnny Depp is a very good willy wonka too
"I wanted to tell WB Legendary studios and new line cinema that if they could appear in space Godzilla, destroya, gamera, king cesar, the son of Godzilla which was said and appeared in godzilla vs kong and the monsters of Godzilla films, in Godzilla and kong the new empire complementing the series for Apple TV and that they appear in the style of Godzilla the king of the monsters, and if they plan to make welcome to derry they should make it arrive in October being a month of terror it is a perfect moment making Michael mijers, Fredy Gruger, Jason Vorges, they know each other because remember they were originally connected and they believe the iron giant 2 because this is one of their memorable films and with a good script they could make a sequel that is up to the task, raising a lot of money for this"
I'm not sure how to feel about this. If feel Wonka is the type of character your not suppose to know about. I feel it ruins the magic if we know his back stories.
mmmm I think I've seen some spoilers I'd rather have not seen but maybe I'll forget em
"If this guy isn’t extremely sassy like the last movie, I will cry."
Trash
More like....WOEKA
1:53 THAT TRAILER SOUNDTRACK THO
"I didn't know they were doing a Willy Wonka movie this year, just saw the trailer (looks amazing).

But is that supposed to be Willy Wonka or the mad hatter bc in the tophat outfit he looks like mad hatter 😅😂

P.S. idk Timothee's exact age but he looks so young he's forever gonna be a pretty boy"
0:10 so funny
Is it too late to recast and reshoot like Back to the Future?
It’s an origin story
I like origin stories
Feel like this prequel is for the Gene Wilder version
Meh
Even more stops pulled out than the other movies and that's just the way we want it!
I love how most of these comments feel AI generated!
I feel like Richard Ayoade would have made a good Wonka.
"This looks fun, I cant wait to see it"
goes the girl doesn't live
I love him but he is not right for this role
WONKA.
"For the love of god, make a NEW movie already."
so what i'm getting here is that clive durham and elio perlman are in a movie together
"Rewrite his books with PC language that goes against the themes of the story, then create needless backstories that bear no ressemblance whatsover to the original character or world.... even if you hate Roald Dahl you don't have to try so hard, he's already dead."
"I'm getting a bit of a 'the world is grey and sad outside, the world in my head is much nicer' vibe from this young Willy Wonka."
Mr. Bean????😅
Filming took place in Warner Bros.
"Filming took place in Warner Bros. Studios, Leavesden in Watford, as well as Lyme Regis, Bath, St Albans and at the Rivoli Ballroom in Crofton Park, London"
STOP RUINING MY MOVIESSSS!!!! AHHHH
i miss Johnny Depp
Johhy always Next Level ...
"It's not enough that Roald Dahl's novel ""Willy Wonka "" has been neutered and woken. Now we have to translate that outrage into cinema."
MrBeast could've been a good Willy Wonka after he made his video. Jimmy Wonka.
How creative. A third remake.
"Is he gonna do it with the cacao too???

🍑"
"Not sure why everyone hated his acting, he did phenomenal"
"How is the little girl following him around relevant to the story? Genuinely curious. I don't know, but just based on this trailer it looks very forced and unnecessary."
Why?
"So apparently people are mad because Hugh Grant is playing a dwarf character. But then literally a while ago, people were also mad at Hollywood for casting dwarf actors for dwarf roles. What do they want???????"
Is this a whole new Willy or is this supposed to be either the original or the Jonny depth Willy wonka but just younger
Piroca
"Waste time, waste money, rebooting a movie, again!  You can't compete with the original.  Try to come up with some more original ideas, and leave the classics alone.  Learn from someone else who made this mistake too many times; Disney."
I will definitely wanna see that
The writing has the quality of a Disney channel show
Feel sorry for kids that get this rubbish instead of the greats. They think this is good 😂😂
Gene Wilder. Actual little ppl.
Better advertisement:   Merry Ol' England....now with BLACK PEOPLE!!!!!!!!
another reason I'm waiting for Christmas
The only reason I’ll watch this is for Timotheé Chalament ✨
I found Rowan in this movie but his screen time is very less😔
reminds me of tartaria
Goodbye Hollywood
"Oompa Loompa doompity doo
Lets hope this movie doesn’t disappoint you"
And in 10 years they'll remake it and call it 'Willy'.
1:30 - that CGI falling chocolate looks garbage
is the black girl Wonka's personal slave?
"diversity hires, diversity hires everywhere 🌈"
"Chalamet could play one of the kids who goes to the factory, but not Wonka"
"I dont understand why people are so critical over the excitement of others. I LOVE Willy wonka it was one of my favorite films to grow up with and to see that Wonka gets a full close look into his origin completely warms my heart. Its exciting and to those who have any and everything bad to say about it can promptly leave everyone else alone. You can have your opinion, but dont use it to bring people down."
You've got to have some kind of arrogance to think you could even come close to being as good as Gene Wilder. Johnny Depp could not do it and neither will you.
how is a Wonka movie being made and Jeremy Allen White is not cast as Wonka?????????? howww???????????????????? how?????????
the  old oompa loompa reference is funny
nooope! JD was better
Stunning the like to dislike ratio here and that so many have given a thumbs down.
This is getting surreal now. Hollywood has been taken over by the bean counters who realize that they can make more money by just regurgitating the same movies over and over and over and over and over and when that fails just Change the lead to a black actor and PRESTO free press and more $$$$$
The pinky promise IS the most solemn vow there is ngl
its wonking time
"“so quiet up and listen down. nope, scratch that, reverse it.”"
"When I heard about the new Willy Wonka trailer, I thought it was gonna be about the Glass Elevator book."
WOW
🦋🦋🦋🦋👁️💗
"Magic black. Check.

Strategically placed black. Check.

Blacks in a time and place where they never existed. Check.

Director feels no need to ostentatiously sprinkle Asians or Hispanics throughout the movie. Check.

It’s all so tiresome.

 Hollywood culturally appropriate all things white, yet they openly hate us. 

You’ll never see them make a movie about all the crime wave’s going on that we see videos of. Pure propaganda."
"I went to the theatres yesterday and when the premiere started I saw the dune part 2 trailer and then winks after, coincidence I don’t know but it was funny🤷‍♀️

Also this is amazing I swear when I go in theatres to watch this I am definitely going to cry, just a fact"
1:50 that woman is from Charlie and the choclate factory Charlie’s mom what if this is Charlie grown up?
1:43 Hitler also had a dream yes
"IS THAT HITLER!?! WTF??  0:30 that’s hilarious

Willy Wonka Wow just Wow"
"He really is becoming a young johnny depp, first it was the Edgar/Edward Scissorhands commercial, now Wonka. Looking forward for the new pirates in a few years xD"
More trash cant wait.
I love how its not just a copy! I think this will be good :)
"here we go, mama!"
Taehyung would be a great Willy Wonka
"The part where Rowan Atkinson / ""Mr Bean"" is shouting ""Run away!"" 😂"
I don’t know why people be hating
"Is it too much to ask, that Hollywood come up with something NEW?????
Gene Wilder IS Wonka! NOBODY WILL EVER DO IT BETTER!!!!!! STOP TRYING!!!!!!

Make an ORIGINAL STORY!!!!!!"
im just here because of rowan atkinson
"Oh no, they made Willy Wonka hot 😭"
"Nah that's not Willy Wonka, that's Floop from spy kids"
I love wonkas facial expressions that might bring more character for a young willy wonka.
"I wonder if this movie is gonna explain his twisted, sadistic personality and his distaste for children."
O o m p a l o o m p a is back
pov: you wanna watch this because of timothee chalamet 😭😭
Timothee Chalamet as Wonka? I mean even Harry Stiles makes more sense...
GET READY FOR ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE CENTURY BECAUSE I JUST SAW ROWAN ATKINSON
I mean.. I guess the next gen will like it but.... Should have just given us a remake of the Movie first... but this is just worrying. They didn't pick ANY of the energetic kids to be him.
So they're really going with the dark origin of Wanka huh?
"Ok, Fickelgruber I can hear and link to the German written on his window, that's probably a German name. But Prodnose....I can't link that to Italian. 
I can't tell if they're genuinely German and Italian (background if not born) or if they're just adding Italian and German to their products name to make it sound fancier"
Will it top the initial one though 🤔
"The title is so generic. It's like when they called the new Peter Pan movie just ""Pan"". So forgettable"
Why not just use real dwarves instead of making a tall man appear to be a dwarf? Woke Hollyweird at it again
ok wonky willy timmy
Жопка
"God, this looks terrible. Some blend of a film and a television ad."
WTF???
I don’t know why people are hating this?
Finally they bringing magic back to the big screens ❤❤❤
1:02  mr bean
Wonka won't be same without Jonny Depp 😢
Please let there be no agendas in this movie. Looks great in this trailer.
"Kid: *dies*

Oompa Loompa: 2:18"
I’m actually excited for this movie. Must be because it’s not Disney.
Matthew Baynton might this movie's saving grace.
No.
"Think in the scene with the flamingos and the running giraffe we're going to bring in the discussion of whether or not zoos are cruel to animals (a lot have gotten better, most I don't think were that considerate of animals back in the early 1900s) - from what I remember Roald Dahl did bring the subject of cruelty to animals into his books, or at least made most of his villains cruel to animals ie the Gregg family with their love of hunting in 'The Magic Finger', Bruno Jenkins burning ants in 'The Witches' (the movies made him a lot nicer than he was in the book), and of course there's the treatment of the birds and the monkeys in 'The Twits'. Of course there's an exception to that being 'Fantastic Mr Fox' (half way, there's Boggins, Bunce and Beans's persecution of Mr Fox and all the other animals on the hill, but there's also the wild animals eating chickens, ducks, geese and turkeys)."
1:04 COOCHIE CHOCOLATE💀🗣️‼️
I actually love the idea of the movie...but timothee chalamet seems so calm?  Wonka is just such an expressive character and the actors acting just doesn't really fit the character? In all fairness this is just the trailer so maybe the film itself will be better and showing more variety in his acting.
"Mean while in the congo
 🍫🍫📦🚶🏿‍♂️🔗🚶🏿‍♂️🔗🚶🏿‍♂️🔐    🙍🏻"
this looks awful.
I’m so excited for this movie
Why even try? Wilder's role has no equal. Hollywood simply can't help itself.
He's clearly paying homage to the Johnny Depp Wonka but it's clear that the film is based on the Gene Wilder Wonka.
"I was hoping for loads of forced diversity, I wasn't disappointed. Thank you, Hollywood."
I through put all my soul
I like i want to fly like you
I like i want to fly like you
Still think it shoulda been Jeremy Allen white
I don’t want the naughty kids in this film
I'm so excited!
Негры везде
Ohh I was like it's giving Harry Potter vibes and then it shows it has the same producer omg
YES!! i'M READY
Bro just get mister beast insted 😭😭😭
willy wonka origin story yay
I have High Hopes for this Movie and I hope it doesnt F up like Flash.
I’m so ready for this movie
I don’t think I’ve ever been so annoyed by a trailer’s opening line
see disney this is how you do spin offs and remakes
how dare u? Depp is the captain Wonka!
This is the kind of movie that I live for ❤🔥
should have had Jeff Goldblum instead he could have made it all about Chaos
"Why not hire Johnny Depp for this role, makes way more sense, and he would have done a amazing job for sure."
Jhonny Wonka Depp will be the best ❤
at 1:41 u can see Mr. bean running from a giraffe
not my wonka
didn't expect mr bean
I've never been less interesting in a movie from its trailer.
またウォンカでワクワクドキドキ出来るなんて、本当夢みたい🍫🥰💖クリスマスシーズン一番の、とびきりのファンタジー映画になりそう🎄🎁絶対に観に行くわ🎬📽
Why not give the people who write exciting new scripts a chance? Instead of remaking Willy Wonka for the THIRD time...
A pinky process is for retards omg so childish
I'm excited with this movie than hunger games or snow white. I think this movie is gonna be fun
"I will shake your structure alone, where will you be with the choice of how to recognize that you obey my own rule where you will try to remain by your own rules, it will be funny to see how the higher elite will be dependent on how you like this, I will teach you how to have boundaries to me and know in what power am I"
Im available im wily wokar 2 🥳🥳🥳
"I have grown so much in scale and with abilities I am so good 🤣🤣🤣 that your coronovirus will destroy me all over the world where I have grown 🤣🤣🤣 I am alone in scale 🤣🤣🤣 through those whom I love, it’s not worth waging a war against me, it’s fraught for you 🤣🤣🤣 yes, you are petty waging your war to me through those whom I love 🤣🤣🤣 where you directly lead me and see that power of me with that return to you 😜😘🤣🤣🤣"
Почему вместо вонка жопка
without Johnny Depp this is a small movie 🤣🤣🤣 this little one 🤣🤣🤣 couldn't play an outstanding role like Johnny Depp played 🤣🤣🤣For Disney you owe me the role of our Johnny for me 🤣🤣🤣 Johnny Dep is always an impressive and stunning role to play Johnny Depp himself can be played by Johnny Depp himself 😘🤣😜
without Johnny Depa this is a small movie 🤣🤣🤣
The Oompa Loompas look even more scuffed than how they did in the 70s
I'm so excited for this!!!!
This guy kinda looks like Daniel Thrasher
"Another classic utterly spoilt by the Hollywood woke brigade. I think the title ""Willy Diversity"" would be much more suitable."
Another one!? Wow! I loved the other ones! I am hyped for sure!
oh i can tell i'm gonna love this
"On the one hand, it looks whimsical and lovely for a Christmas movie. On the other, and I might be the cheese that stands alone, I feel like Chalamet is not weird enough for the role - his lines fall flat to me. I love Chalamet so hoping the movie will change my mind. I'll watch if only for Grant as a oompa loompa, what genius casting!"
It feels more like a broadway play than a movie
i thought it was daniel thrasher lol
Willy gives me more sexual predator vibes in this not evil chocolate king pin
0:01 the heist
Disappointed that the Oompa Loompas aren’t Indian like last time
Sorry but this looks bad way to chessy way to over the top yeah not for me
Poor Flamingos
Oh no! Not another renake!!!
Why does this movie look so lame 💀
i think willy wonka's weirdness was the most important feature that made him special...
"Change wonka actor, he looks/sounds too amateur for such a sophisticated and mysterious lead. Similar to Daniel Radcliffe, & Cole/Dylan Sprouse’s career after their title spotlight concluded."
"It looks visually well done
but then again so did Depp's portrayal..."
Is that Daniel Thrasher?
"Why make a 3rd one?
Well whatever even if this is good the other two are the golden ones shining more than those tickets."
Can’t wait!
"Nothing original is ever produced, just multi ethnic remakes"
The movie wil be successful! Timothee is great as Willy Wonka
find another flame hot as me
Thimothée is the best wonka❤❤❤
What fun! Something to make one laugh - just what we need.
Who is this for? Why?
gaaaarbage
"It has ""The series of unfortunate events"" written all over it, but I'm here for that!"
More race swapping dreck
Tom Holland wanted this role so bad
"I love how they pulled lots of storyline content from the classic gene wilder film. Even the main character has resemblance of a young wilder.
Look forward to seeing it"
"Director of Paddington 
The Christmas feel 
The cast 

This is going to be a brilliant magical Xmas film 100% this year I can tell"
Why does Wonka need to be done again? I’m so sick of these remakes.
"Oh I miss Gene Wilder I loved all his films I think he was actua slightly nuts which is what made him the perfect wonka, same with Johnny Depp 🥺 I feel like you need to be a little nuts to play Willy Wonka .. it seems like we will have three great wonka’s to be fair!  ❤❤❤ can’t wait! 

Can you think of any other people that would have or would make a good wonka? For me Robin Williams would have made a great Wonka"
This one doesn’t match the tone that much
This looks absolutely awful
I Want to Watch it ❤😮
Where can we watch this?❤
Why can't Hollywood come up with anything original anymore. Serious question.
This movie mostly seems like a strenuous exercise in Mandatory Diversity Casting until the last 10 seconds when it introduces the extremely white Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa. And Hugh is hilarious.
hot take but i think chalamet is cardboard personified so this has me nervous lol. hope its good though
I've seen a lot of these actors i feel like this will be a great movie.
I hate where he is whispering in darkness
No thanks
Starring the two Academy Award losers of 2018!
Its good but depp could make better
Why not Johnny Depp?
I don’t know why everyone is hating on it because Timothee is wonka! It looks so good!!
Timothee Chalamet is everywhere😅
It’s wonka time
Timothée Chalamet is perfect for a willy Wonka roll.
A cast of most of my favourite actors
First word that came to mind to describe this movie is “Lovely”
I'm scared
Another remake?  What an unexpected treat.  Wake me up in a few years and I might get excited.
"I loved when he said ""OMPAA'S......ASSEMBLE!"""""
0:43 he made a chocolate person!
"Another reboot??

There needs to be one where Willy Wonka would be played by ""Weird Al"" Yankovic. I wonder what that would be like.

Also, one of the tests should be like the three course dinner gum, but instead, it would be a COVID vaccine."
Ticking the diversity boxes I see
Another remake from a creatively bankrupt industry
From Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp to Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka! It’s like a whole new generation!
Not the write actor pick. Not enough charisma or madness in his eyes 💀
It's not canon
"Wow Timothee was a huge miscast from the role, it’s like he’s forcing himself to act eccentric"
Charlie and the chocolate factory ❤
"1:41 Rowan ""Mr. Bean"" Atkinson said the line from Monty Python"
Paul after Arrakis
Random black girl with wonka. You devils dont sleep with the brainwashing
"Heres my question, why are the oompa loompas getting even smaller like in every film!?"
Remember Dwarfs are  not allowed to play dwarf roles anymore because it's demeaning...... soo let's edit a person to make them look like a little person woohoo ...  how is the left not crying abo8t this
"Christ. As IF we needed a remake of this. 
Let alone, another movie with THIS guy.

Mark me, within four years there will be multiple sequels."
1:41  MR BEAN😍
No one asked for this. 😂
FROM THE DIRECTORS OF PADDINGTON!! ........I'M OUT 😂😂
Ok but hear me out…. How about we make some original story’s for once instead of just remaking movies and shows over and over again
Umm didn't Jonny  ... nvm
It looks like it will be a good film... but I also like the mystery behind Willy Wonka so I probably won't watch it. But it does look like it would be something I'd enjoy watching.
0:10
When he says “with great chocolate comes great responsibility” gave me chillbumps
No Charlie bucket
I may be going crazy but is that Matthew Baynyon??? 1:35
I hope it is diverse enough
Whimsical.
"too late, i’ve started dancing now ~"
Harley idol
"Honestly, I'm most curious about Chalamet's musical and dancing abilities.  The trailer has a magical atmosphere suitable for a Christmas movie, so I hope the movie does well."
Nah what if people with wands just show up bc harry potter producers.
Never understood why they dont use English actors to play english parts
Why does Willy Wonka look like Daniel Thrasher?
Its good to see a tralier where is just about how he started and not how he is bitter or way to happy and is taking kids around and making their dreams come true.
"This looks absolutely without a doubt, atrocious"
What a missed opportunity to feature Jeremy Allen White as Wonka instead. 😢
"It's really nice to see a different way Wonka gets to his success and I like it already, I actually wanna go see this in theaters now. The Victorian Era honestly gives it a different charm and I like it, something new & fresh too."
Can not wait🎉 for comeback of timmy🎉🎉🎉❤
Why am I all of the sudden very hyped for this movie.
My My the journey of delicious chocolate will began again 😋
I think at some point Dahl had a job as a chocolate taster. I just know he had a life-long love of it.
thumbs up for doin something original and not a remake  👍
0:17 shes nicks mom in heartstopper!
A film I wont be watching
Timothée Chalamet needed a flop anyway
0:10
They could have chosen somebody other than Timothee. This role absolutely was not made for him.
This genuinely looks good! I think a “Chocolate Cartel” is very in character for Rhal Dall and his books. I think this will be a great movie!
"But in order to make this a masterpiece, Warner bros have to fire David zasher ( sorry don't remember)"
I think Johnny Depp was the greatest when he was in the movie Charlie and the chocolate factory
Can’t wait for this to turn out like meatcanyons wonka
Did this is the backstory of Willy Wonka then I will watch this because there are three movies and this is not enough to Johnny depp film
This look terrible
0:40 WHY DAYDREAMING WHEN THERES A LAW?
"First there was the original, and then the first remake which was terrible, and this remake, which makes the terrible one look good . . .great . . . ."
So is meant to be a young gene wilder willy wonka?
"I can't wait, but I don't think it will be as good as the OG."
I love TC and really want this movie to be good but the forced quirkiness is giving me cringe I don’t think I could sit through more than 30 minutes of it
There was the classic never to be matched original.  And then there was theEast German S&M dungeon club one with Johnny Depp.  Now we have the Hogwarts one.
How many Willy wonka movies do we need ?
Why
Terrible acting terrible story telling 100x worse than Johnny depps version and a million times  worse than wilder's
Chalamet performance seems very flat m.
lmao the industry knows how nostalgia-pilled this generation is
the og ompalompa is back!
"December 23 .🙂. Van de makers Paddington en Harry Potter. 💖.
Leuke avond .slaapwel deze nacht. .🌠🌌"
"Grunka Lunka dunkatey doo,

We got another TimCham movie for you."
Who's here after travis dissed Timothee and Kylie on utopia
Use it for Dislike
I’m so excited for this movie I grew up with Charlie and the chocolate factory movies. I love it so much the acting perfection
No Daydreaming.
Who are these writers? This is dreadful. You have to be kidding me. I'm sorry but you should be sentenced to 3 to 5 years in federal prison >>>>>>>>>>
Ew Timothy chalamet sucks
"I'm in  love with Chalamet but him trying to do a ""quirky"" character is mad cringe :("
1:41 was that mr bean?!
Who up wonking they willy
This is basically the 1900s and 2000s W.W combined together
I just dont feel like this guy has the same charm as gene wilder did in the 70s.
timthy charmand sock de wonka for de golden tiket xddddddd
This looks worthy of one of those family movies I could show my kid and they could say they saw this as a kid AND the original  one
"""Willy wonka doesn't matter to you?"""
"seeing timothée chalamet, mr. bean, and keegan michael key in the same film is something i would've never imagined to happen"
OK THE OMPA LOMPA IS TOO COOL
Wonka is back
"looks garbage , ngl"
Timotheee...... So excited
Cringe
"oh I get it, we're in an era where classic movies that may have already been remade, will now get remade AGAIN so black people can be in it. Fun."
I LOVE TIMOTHEE CHALEMET'S ACTING IN THIS SO SO MUCH MAN ITS FRFR GIVING WILLY WONKA I LOVE THIS CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT FR PLS
Anybody who watched 0:09 and says that they're sold on this guy as Wonka is an absolute fool
I dont get excited about many movies but this looks awesome
wonka siempre será johnny deep. cagada total de esta peli
timothjee sucks so bad
"I love how they took elements from both movie adaptations and turned it into a complete package. I got emotional hearing a cinematic remake of Pure Imagination, the Oompa Loompas look just like in the Gene Wilder movie, and they managed to keep that wonderful magical vibe of the Johnny Depp movie"
I've had this idea for years
"Timothée Chalamet be like: Nope, scratch that, ✨reverse it✨"
Wow😢
You know..... Im something of a wonka myself...
"Rowan, best part of the trailer, rest looks meh"
At first i was like was that rowan atkison then as it played i heard him say run away i was like nevermind its mr bean
"Oh, I am DEFIITELY seeing this one."
"Woah such a diverse cast
They're definitely going for the Oscars this year"
Please make a Chuck movie. Chuck fans are waiting for a movie.
"I’m glad they made a new one, the Jonny Depp one was unwatchable & AWFUL."
"The trailer is so heartwarming, I teared up when at 2:02 wonka spelled out in chocolate. Good'ol childhood."
I’m actually excited about this . I grew up with the original ones with Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp .
The old Wonka movies is not enough?
I’m actually intrigued. I will see this.
Were I can see it ?
WBCU Willy Wonka vs MCU Tom Holland Spiderman who wins? battleground takes place in Wonka Town 100 yrds apart
This is already TWO THUMBS DOWN 🔥
MMRRRR BEEEAAAANNN
"ES ÚNICO,ES ÚNICO!!!😊"
They keep trying to make Timothee Chalamet happen but he doesn’t have the movie star magic. There are a thousand of him.
Garbage.
"will these studio stop unnecessary casting of black actors.. eg that child actor. Cast some one who is perfect for the role. I have scene the Johnny Depp version and It's clearly killing that vibe. Another can be said as Diseny for changing cast and storyline of fairy tales.. eg mermaid... or barbi.. at the end of the time.. These are doing nothing but destroying what is in real extremly precious. I live alone and have great loving parents and they provided me everything to grow on my own and so I did.. but this growth came with a price that these people dont understand.

so, I hope people will turn towards philosophy once again and instead of destroying original stuffs for no reason at all.. they'll start celebrating it."
Zero interest in this. It couldn’t look more bland.
"creo firmemente que timothée hará un buen trabajo, el es un gran actor, nos lo ha demostrado muchas veces."
Weird casting choice for Willy Wonka . I don't like it
"He has his place, but Timothee Chalamet is not Willy Wonka."
I see a lot of people hate on this and yeah it's another reboot but this looks genuinely lovely
is this a prequal to the other movie?
"I swear all original ideas are from the late 1960 to earlier 2000s and after 2010, the glorified remake era. You're telling me no can come up with something original. Meh!!!"
omg 1:02
im sorry but that shoulda been a brit
"Timothy Chalamet: plays a desert messiah/warrior on a hostile desert planet

Also Timothee Chalamet: plays Willy Wonka’s  successor"
kind of cringe but looks ok
We already have TWO versions of the Willy Wonka story; do we really need another?
this is about the cannabis industry lol
This movie looks dumb and boring
It makes me hummm ... I will have to see it before I can say yeay or neah but so far nobody has succeeded it reproducing willy wonka... That compares to the video gene wilder did...
Why so young?
Just one simple question:  why?
Mm GOOD 👌👍
This actually looks like a fun movie. Would be a great change of pace from a lot of movies we’ve been getting this year
Once we started we can't stop 😂
"Alot of people are bashing on it, but this isn’t necessarily a remake, its a “prequel” of sorts, willy wonka’s backstory and, i dont rly follow timothee, i think he’s doing good so far, a few bits here and there were it didnt quite fir but id watch it"
This dude is the Harry Potter of chocolate.
This looks terrible
"Ok, y'all love him but having someone attempt to be Wonka after Dep is just… I'll just say this you have to be ready for a role like this and you have to have the capabilities to be animated. It looks ok alone but when I compare it I don't want to really watch it."
Timoothe is having 2 movies this year dune and Wonka.
This looks like a nightmare. Just stop!!
"Because we can all use a little Wonka in our lives every now and then.  (Also, a little Timmy too)
😊"
So quiet up!
"If this film doesn’t have any female blueberry (or other fruit-related) inflation in it, then no deal."
This looks awful
This looks magical! 😍😍
Anyone else watched the early version
"i need to tell my sister this, shes a hardcore fan of the willy wonka franchise O>O"
Kid playing wonka Is dead
I hate Oompa Loompas with a passion but now I’m just confused. I like Hugh Grant but want to throw his character into a meat grinder.
"Sorry but the guy playing Willy Wonka has zero strangeness and weirdness that Wonka needs, I'm gutted I was looking forward to this."
I DONT THINK SO   PEOPLE !!!!
I'm proud of Timmy
Why didn't they hire true ommpa loompa
"Meh to happy go lucky, its like making a Friday the thirteenth movie but taking away Jason and just having a bunch of people with borderline personalities living on a camp, plus the whole thing is gonna end up tied to the harry potter universe which is annoying"
ㅜㅜㅜㅠ얼른 보고싶다..🥺🫶🏻
December is too far off to see this
I love when i get spoiled the entire film from a trailer
Wonka Potter.  Pass
The dude playing wonka reminds me of Daniel Thrasher and that is hillarious.
how did I know Charlie was going to be a black girl with afro hair 🙄
Its so funny when see rowan atkinson running
1:41 Mr.Bean with the cameo!
i love this budding genre of taking a member of the main cast of a movie who isn’t always the main character and giving them an origin movie titled said character’s last name
Who thought Chalamet was a good actor
I love wonka❤❤❤❤❤😂😂😂😂😂😂 he's the best I'm excited for this to come out
"I love when Wonka says:
It's wonking time"
producers of harry potter? im in!
"Логотип “Wonka”, похож на русское слово Жопка😁"
How in 1800s back people are treated so nicely
1:42 Mr. Bean casually chilling in the script
I've never seen so many black people in a 1920s-era central-European town...must've been part of a post WW1 programme...
I'm pretty sure I'm going to hate it 😭 usually remakes are fairly decent. Well with all the woke nonsense. You're asking to be kicked in the balls!
its actually strike that reverse it
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has heart. This trailer is a fail on that.
"Gene Wilder had charisma... Timothy Chalamet is a more of a brooder, so it's difficult to see him as Wonka."
Why isn't Jeremy Allen White cast in this? I feel cheated...
They should have left it at Johnny Depp honestly
sera un hran jhonny deep algun dia
hugh hrant mi amor de todos los teimpos
el here go mama llore
omgggg sere la primera en verla
la ultima escena wowowwowoow
esto luce magico
"mr bean, gran actor, feliz de verlo otraver"
"amo a timothée, será un gran wonka"
0:11 hands down the most cringe part
"MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO -- 90% of the comments are AI bots from some marketing company. I guess they think most people plan their purchases by reading anonymous 'opinions'. Probably works, and is dirt cheap to implement."
I feel like I could have played Wonka better.
racias timmyy
muy humilde
me encanta desde ue salio en call me by your name
jhonny deep es abusivo ue bueno ue eligieron ptro actor
tomothy debio aver sido napoleom

el trailer luce decente pero no la bere en el cine
papacito
papacotopp
timmy es mejor actor que tom holland
el mejor wonka
lo amo
me encanto
"Can't wait for him to say : "" It's wonking time"" and then wonk all over the screen"
Luv the brief glimpse of Hugh Grant with Wonka.  I’m thinking more positively but there’s a very high bar that I doubt will be eclipsed!
Willy wanka
Willy Wonka is belong to cap jack sparrow I swear 😢
Hollyweird... out of ideas for 15 ffkkg years.  If it wasn't for comics.. they'd be bankrupt
AHHHHHHH THIS IS SOOOO GOOOOOODDDD
"What do you get when you guzzle down sweets?
Eating as much as an elephant eats 🐘
Who can you blame.... for your terrible shame?  😞
The mother and the father!  🤓
heh.   sounds good..... : P"
Terrible performance from the main actor. Couldn't they have found another Jewish actor who could at least act like Johnny Depp? 😂😂😂
Mix the letters in santa… s a t a n
Ew
"Just been to see the current UK theatre tour and it's spin on the original film and enjoyed it
Enjoyed the trailer but it's going to spoil the magic of the original film"
Pls no more remakes!!!!!!!!!!!!
❤
GET AN ORIGINAL IDEA!
its gonna be a great december
This comes on my mother’s 37th birthday!
"I really REALLY hope this is good, still waiting on the sequel to charlie and the chocolate factory :>"
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh no
Timothee Chalamet really has me crushing on Willy Wonka. He’s quite the character.
"Finally! After all the dreck from Disney & Co. this movie actually looks like a fun film that hopefully families will want to watch, teens, adults and even old people like me can really enjoy some theater magic again. Hope it lives up to the trailers hype!"
this looks interesting! I’ll be waiting for this one to come out!
give us the press tour for this film pleek
Looks Promising
Amazing!!! I wanna see this
Too much magic not enough science
Timothee seems like a mis-cast imo 🤷🏽‍♂️
I kinda don't like the way they turned him into a Mary Poppins type character
Running out of movies to make🙄
This is gonna be an awesome movie!
"I’m go watch it not because I actually like whimsy, but just for a fact that the Oompa Loompa looks exactly like an Oompa Loompa should look, not like miniature Mexican."
If I see Mr bean I’m warching
IM SORRY BUT WHY IS THIS GETTING CLOWNED ONN Its kinda good its a childrens movie so what it's a lil cringey it's not as bad as some other movies Ive seen-
Got a feeling that this film is gonna under-perform BIG TIME
"Going to be honest with an unpopular opinion. This movie sounds pretty cringe. Not in the Johny Depp as Willy Wonka kind of cringe! But in the sort of... Overly whimsical nostalgia bait kind of cringe. I mean.. ""The Chocolate Cartel"" Really? A law against daydreaming? I'm all for an origin story but this is just a bit.. much?"

"I honestly thought that this was going to be a dark, gritty movie with guns"
"Another classic story ruined by modern times. Every single thing about this trailer screams cliche. From the name, to the actors, to the music, to the cgi, to the bad writing, to the costumes, to the every god damn thing. This is exactly what every 2020's movie/trailer is. It's terrible, and you just know this will get about a 6 on IMDB, with people left thinking they overappreciated the older movies because of nostaligia, while they actually were good and this is bad."
I am SO READY for this!
where is his dentist father ?
REGGIE?!?!?!?/j
Yeah I'm looking forward to this.
It looks good. More like the movie with Gene Wilder.
"I feel like I'm not gonna be too afraid of Wonka after this adaptation! Ever since I was a child, I was horrified of him, but Chalamet's version seems like he just wanted to make a chocolate factory, not a kid murdering, money laundering scheme like the last few💀.


Also, The ompalompas!

It's Poll Atreitas!
Wait Rowan ankison
From 02:10. completely woke. I will skip this movie.
Lol I hope the strike goes on forever in the hope future generations are spared.
why willy wonka has children around him
Our childhood is upcoming
Bunk
Wow 😳
"Ohh no... Just by watching this 2 minute tailer... I can tell... This is bad... really.. really bad... This has like a corky kids tale with a very goofy like script.. Very very goofy like script. Now that I think about it... This movie is like that tv show the girl with the pink hair and that annoying bozo guy.... Whatsss that loony tv show called againnnn....... ohh yeahhh... LAZYTOWN!!!.... Literally the same genre of film... This is really not good.. I'm a huuuge Willy Wonka fan but this movie isn't it... The title and vintage movie art had me convinced... truly... Until I've seen the actually movie scenes. The acting is very forced.. its obvious.. the ''magic'' is literally handed in this movie.. Handed like in a effortless goofy way... Honestly man, they just don't make the movie like they used to.. UGHH... I really do not want to watch this film (I'm usually 99.9% right about movies) but if it's good I'll come back and edit this comment... But man... it's not promising...."
When I heard the plot I was like that’s sick! I watch the trailer and now I’m sick. 😔
Fantasy magic that doesn’t exist beats the corrupt businessmen!!! 🤦‍♂️
"nice, I want to see it, I love it."
"Disliked for injecting black character and not good main actor as willy wonka , this going to be a huge flop 😊"
"God this looks… off. This is not a Timothy Chalamet part. It’s just because he’s popular and has the look of Wonka, so they decided to go with it. Him being all kooky just doesn’t match him at all and seems very forced and unnatural."
I am sooo excited for this one!! 😃😃😃😃🤩🤩🤩🤩🎩🎩🎩🎩❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️✨✨✨✨✨✨
i'll wait the story wonka met oompa loompa
Prequel to the Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka!
"What are you gonna do Willy?
**Slavery!!!**"
Why must they make origin movies for everything?
"Ik everyone is saying this is going to be the flop of the year, but I have a feeling everyone is going to forget they said that when it comes out and they LOVE it. Trailers can be misleading, let’s just wait and see how the actual movie is before criticizing."
I hope this movie fails!  Looks AWFUL!!!
dawg
Token black of course
A real cocoa tree tree?  I guess not
I don’t understand why so many people have a problem with Timothee’s acting. I think this trailer is great and I strongly believe he portrays Willy Wonka really well
This looks lame 😞☹️
"If this stays lighthearted but emotional I could give it a chance.  Just, I pray, don't shoehorn in any preachy ideology stuff.  It could be great prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.  Even using the best Oompa Loompa version!."
"Ralph Fiennes would be an incredible Willy Wonka. Why not make a sort of sequel where Wonka transfers ownership to Charlie? Make marketing a new, fantastical candy a part of the plot. Advance the steampunk technology in a way that maybe comments on automation in factories. It’d be something seemingly more special than the cash grab attempt at “what if BEFORE (blank)?”"
You need to release this at the same time as some other thematically opposite movie for meme marketing
Priest Bean
This is more canon to the original willy Wonka than Johnny Depp's performance of the character.
So sad that the Ompa Lompa’s aren’t midgets anymore. CGI Hugh Grant looks lame
Woke Willy wonka.

Ooh this is gonna be good
Use me as a dislike button.
So quiet up 😃☝️and listen down 😃👇
"This actually sucks, couldn't have made a worse casting for Wonka."
"""So you're the owner of the chocolate factory, thats a good thing, use it!""
""Because all my visions lead to horror""
""Because you lose control of the chocolate factory?""
""Because I gain it."""
timothy would be a disaster for this role
"""The Greatest Showman"" meets ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"". Looks promising!"
Rowan Atkinson's in this?!
#bts
Ruined it
I’m so excited to see this movie! Timothee Chalamet is perfect for young Willy Wonka
"Even if this wasn't tired, hackneyed boring bollocks the same as everything else that's come out recently, I never wanted to know more about Willy Wonka than I already do.
You reveal too much, you ruin the mystery. You ruin the mystery, you ruin the magic."
🤷🏿‍♂️ release on December 15th
Movies now in a nutshell
"Oof, this gave me second-hand embarrassment."
"This is the 4rth chocolate factory movie, how many are there coming? 500?"
1:30 who is she is guys??
We missed Johnny Depp 🥺❤
Why cant movie directors come up with their own movies instead of recreating movies??? This is horrible.
NO.
Another one for 5 dollar bin at Walmart
RIP Gene Wilder
thanks for this trailer so I can know in advance that it's another trash movie with typical mandatory diversity agenda. Tim Burton's looks much better
And this is the same guy who had got raw dogged by some dude in another movie.
what a disgrace. this new age of film is RUINING GREAT STORIES. apologize to johnny depp now for this warner bros.
no thank you.
CANT WAIT FOR THIS 🎉
YAY
oooooooh love that Timmothy Chalamet!!!!such talent and so schmart!!!!
"Oh look, another remake of a movie that they continue to beat into submission. Does anyone have a new idea anymore?"
Looks like it's going to be as bad as Johnny depp's
it's giving Robert downey jr Dolittle...and we know how that went
Looks pretty baaaaaaaad
I hope the wonka bars come out to promote the movie.
Not feeling this trailer because Timothée is kind of awkward as wonka.
"And just like that, I'm in the Christmas Spirit"
"As someone who grew up with both Wilder and Depp’s Wonka, thinking they were both fantastic in their own right, an origin story sounds like nobody wants it, but will be interesting."
But Willy Wonka’s racism is key to his character. Also him being apathetic af about ruining everyones’ lives.
Is this a prequel to Johnny or Wilder?
This entire trailer all I could think about was the Willy Twonka SNL skit
lead actor is not a successful choice he is not talanted
until someone cheated you. i would love to see how wonka ended to be a solo act
"Ham fisted attempt at ""magic"" by the communist overlord cinema servants, because they are failing on so many fronts."
Looks insufferable.
I am unhappy with the studio’s creative choices on this feature-length film. Please make this better.
"you can change all their lives, you can give them diabetes"
OMFG STOP FORCING EVERYONE TO BE BLACK IN THE MOVIE
All im gonna say is keep all the other garbage prequels in mind before swearing this movie is a masterpiece
I think the story is about pedophilia .
1:02   mr bean / rowin atkinson
Timothy is such a good actor. He was able to convey the fact that he was given this role as an offer-only no audition role on screen so well.
I’m definitely going to watch it
Please oh please be a musical!
DOGECOİN DOGECOİN DOGECOİN ♥️♥️♥️
After the terrible Jonny dep version will this be any good
The only reason to see this movie is rowan atkinson...
I typed in modern day Willy Wonka expecting some kind of sketch or parody. But ofcourse there was a new movie coming out.
Looks like a snooze fest
Wondering how many re-takes there were every time the phrase “Mr Wonka” was uttered cos someone mis-pronounced the surname slightly.
Pls if you have a film pls don't make ezra in there
but he is no where near Johnny
Excited for this!
no way did they get Rowan Atkinson as the preist
Paddington's mom was there and here it's his mom so does that mean he's paddingt-
i LOVE this
"You see, I'm something of a magician,🧙 inventor, 🧑‍🔧and chocolate maker.🍫 So quiet up ⬆️and listen down.⬇️ Nope❌🙅 scratch that reverse it 🔄"
I can’t wait till freaking Christmas!!! 😤😤😤😤I want it now!
Absolute Garbage. 🤢🤮
"I love the part where Timothee said ""it's wonking time."" Really a movie of many generations and timely accurate depictions."
"I love the part where Roman Reigns went ""Acknowledge Me"" and everyone went wild."
But why do the police look German?
What will this me on like will it be on Netflix Disney Hulu or what Becuz I love this movie
Came here just to say “boooo”
I’m not sure how to feel about this
Who up wonking their willy??
Gene Wilder is rolling over in his grave.
Excited about this lol
& keegan michael key as keegan michael key.
I always loved the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Ive watched it so many times and it brings so many memories
I can’t wait to watch ❤.
Why doesn Hollywood refuse to hire actors with dwarfism to play little characters anymore?
This is bringing back all of my early childhood memories. Loved the original to death when I was really little. I wish Gene Wilder would have been alive to see this. RIP ❤️❤️
Who up wonkin their willy rn
"""Too late. I've starting dancing now."" 🤣"
"This kid has “it”.  I’ve never seen him in anything before, but it’s obvious he can carry a movie.  Can’t wait to see the Willy Wonka movie, just like Barbie - straight out of my childhood.  And Hugh Grant as a grumpy Oompa Loompa, perfect casting."
This ain’t it
"I'm from old school 
i can't watch this kinda:  so cute movies with there so cute heroes my last good watching masterpiece was  back to 2010 with Inception since that I can see the first 18 mnts of any movie then i cancel. a big apologies to all the great directors....... 😅"

Imagine theres a post credit scene teasing charlie bucket 😂
Aight so like.. this is making me wanna play more Hogwarts for some reason💀
I'm definitely not watching this heap of garbage and I hope it flops
Only problem I have is the Oompa Loompa. They needed to hire small people to actually play the part. They made Hugh Grant too small.
"No one can replace the great Gene Wilder, but Timothee Chalamet has a certain Boyish Charm that a younger version of the character needs."
Love the trailer look forward to it
"Wait a minute, New Dream Wonka Game Collection; 1 Wonka PC Game, 1 Wonka CD-ROM, 1 Wonka Video Game, 1 Wonka Website Game, 1 Wonka DVD-RAM, and 1 Wonka Mobie Game."

"O-M- F**** -G
THE MUM IS THE MUM FROM PADDINGTON????? AHHH"
Man this movie might flop big time.
I am so excited for this movie Wonka. After watching it's first parte and know this. Can't wait. I think this part is going to be more fascinating and full of discoveries ❤🥰
Yeah but why make another willy wonka movie tho
"If its not Johnny Depp, it is not for me."
I'll watch it only because of rowan aktison as the priest
This movie seems confused
Naaaaaahhh.
Suena mucho mejor en ingles pero me estresa leer español con audio en ingles
Chocolate makes you fly? XD
awkkkk hurry up and come out already i cant wait any longer
I watched this and now I miss my friend Paalvee....
1:51 thts the mom from paddington!
Timothy Chalamet is the next Johnny depp 😊
Stop with the remakes
"Can't wait! this is gonna be amazing, any version of charlie and the chocolate factory will be respected forever 😃
Thank you Roald Dahl for writing such a masterpiece that is now being retold in many different ways
And Timmothée Chalamet is gonna own the role of Willy Wonka 😊
I have a feeling this is gonna be the best one yet!"
Why am I crying after watching this. All the best actors even Rowan Atkinson
Woke garbage
"I think this will be good! It is different than the two previous ones as it should be! Johnny’s Willy Wonka, and Gene Wilders Willy Wonka were not meant to compete. I am excited for this one! Then we can have three different versions!"
F*$k Yes!
pass. gonna still prefer old Wonka because hollywood just knows how to f up everything
"Willy Wonka, of all people, should know that white chocolate isn't chocolate.

It contains no cocoa solids."
Wee man would’ve been better if he played as an Oompa Loompa instead
cool but johnny depp 😔
Is he still filming Dune 2023?
Hugh grant is great but I feel that a little person could have had a big role to shine and make a mark in Hollywood
This will never be the original movie.
Imagine there being a third willy wonkamovie
The movie where every other character is made of chocolate.
WAS THAT MR.BEAN?!?!?
Here we go mama ❤
This looks gayer than aids
No ITS NOT
"Love the part were he said ""its wonking time"""
God isn’t umpa lumpa supposed to be blue ?
"Am I the only one who thinks this look terrible? Apparently so according to the comments. I like a lot of the cast, but it does not look good to me at all."
"unless this was written by Roald Dahl its not really "" wonka"" is it !!"
What a who's who of acting talent. Dear god I'd watch this film just for the cast list alone.
This looks awful! Come up with something original for heaven's sake!
This movie looks like some dogwater but i not gonna lie the oompa loompa was gold
"I hate remakes, but this actually looks amazing and hilarious!"
Amazing ❤❤❤
I only smiled when mr bean showed up:)
Sweet so we're going to find out how he got his hat?
"i don't like it one bit, sorry timmy, it's giving me ""fantastic beasts"" vibes a lot... which is not good. also why is hugh granr an oompa loompa and not a little person actor"
"Nooooooooo! Why keep doing this over and over? He's no Gene Wilder :(   If they just hadn't called it Wonka, had just let it be a ""new"" story I could watch it."
However Jonny dep is the best character for wonka ❤🍫
"Ain't gonna lie, this movie looks fire 🔥🔥🔥"
Timothy Chalamat does not look good as Willy Wonka.
vltl
I have gotta watch this
if i dont see danny devito as one of the oompa loompas.
Few movies are more dependent on the lead actor than Willy Wonka.  Gut reaction from this abbreviated trailer is that they missed the mark.
"Wow, I'm bored."
Willy wonka choclates
Harry potter broom
No.
"""From the Director of Paddington and Producers of Harry Potter"" geeeez louise, I am so excited for this, TC as Wonka!!!!"
"Let’s keep remaking old movies into woke garbage INSTEAD of new, creative and intelligent ideas.    We will call it…….art!!  Then cry when no one sees it, demand more money for actors because they are SO CHEATED, then allow them to continue to look down their noses at us and virtue signal to us."
Trying so hard to copy Disney 😂
A black cops in the Victorian era... Yes sure... 🙄
A charming actor plays a great Willy Wonka who really want to see this movie
0:41 lol
WHOAAA❤❤❤
"0:24, y'all still didn't get the reference lmao...?"
doesnt look as eccentric version from johnny depp
Rewatching this trailer many times just shows how this one just wants to be fun. I can't wait!
eh.
I prefered johnny depp as willy.😟
"1:15 “Nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying the laws of physics!”"
"Do it up colorful, once they get to factory 🏭 
Looks good so far! Willy is great. GREAT Christmas 🎄 movie to see here."
Boring 😴
hopefully I don’t see an Oompa Loompa
What a flop 😂
Token is getting a lot of work now a days.
"I want the movie to be a good movie, but I just feel like this movie is gonna flop. Like Timothée Chalamet seems like a good actor, but hearing his voice, it just feels like he’s holding it back on something that could be better! It sounds a little cringy. Like lol, it sounds like in the trailer as if he doesn’t want to be filming the movie at all"
im not watching this sorry
Timthee is low key overrated
I think Paul inhaled too much spice and is hallucinating.
Here we go mama!
I hope he emotes in this movie.
"Idk I think Wonka should be an older person to be honest, not some young twink who looks like he barely has any experience running a giant chocolate company"
yasdssss
Gosh
Can we stop naming movies and series literally just the last name of the main character
real opinions = sort comments by newest.
"brain dead humour.""HUH... DOUBLE HUH..."""
Race swapping and woke.
Wsh c’est bleu un wompa loumpa non ?!
Looks not that good
Wish Johnny Depp could do it😊
Stop
looks like poo
Um... Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa? SOLD. 😂😂😂
Who saw this trailer with Barbie
No
Johnny Depp is incomparable. Psychologically it doesn’t sink to me. The Willy Wonka in my brain is Johnny. The movie looks great though.
"Oh no! Wonka is white! Cancel this movie!

Lmao"
"Still should have cast a dwarf as the Ompa Lompa rather than using CGI to mask a tall person as a dwarf.
It looks better when you have people fit their roles physically according to the source material.
Just wanted to point this out for those not aware of it in this movie."
I must not eat chocolate. Chocolate is the mind-killer. Chocolate is the little-death that brings total obliteration. I will face my chocolate. I will permit it to pass over me and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path. Where the chocolate has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.
They used real “pure imagination” to make this film
The director could produce manage to make a live action adaptation of food wars minus the animeisms like Booba everywhere
This looks god awful
My dream life 🥺🥺🥺💗💗💗
When did lil mabu become an actor
Can’t you people come up with a original idea? You just remake the same movies over and over. It’s boring and pathetic.
this looks terrible
I don’t think he has the charisma to pull off wonka. Sorry lad.
i’m sorry but no one will ever overshadow johnny depps performance as willy wonka bye
Well at least I see a black girl character
Damn come up with Something new
This looks like Harry Potter but without Harry Potter 😂
Willie wonka and chocolate chip factory
If Wilcox and punchsrelle got to together with Willie wonka chipuwunka
"Hehe, Timothy charmander hehe"
LETS GOOO
LETS GOOO
1:41 run awaaaay
People complaining that Wonka is overacting when that’s literally his personality and how the character is 😂😂 people can be stupid af sometimes
trailer made the movie look boring asf....
It’s good Warner brothers ain’t becoming like Disney and 6 foot tall Oompa Loompas
"WAIT, why is Wonka not BLACK???"
Am i crazy or is Timothy not a good actor...everything he does seems forced and plastic its just not good or organic
I feel like it has been long time since last movie that offering full happy dream like this produced.😢
Cool another movie that will be released on my birthday🎉 can't wait
Let’s just hope there’s no windy scenes in this movie. Timothée Chalamet should not be in windy movies!
It looks so bad
Yeah I think I still only care about the original I don't think that I'm so committed to the original that they couldn't put together something that would impress me but this doesn't look like it's it
Sooo many fake likes.
Why blax?
One perfect movie is all that has ever been made from these books. That was the 1971 Gene Wilder telling. Everything after that just leaves me uninterested. This is going to look beautiful and be instantly forgettable just like Tim Burton/Johnny Depp film.
Is that Mr Bean
What happened to originality?
I heard about the Wonka movie and really hoped that they chose an amazing actor. I am so glad its him. He's an amazing actor omg
all i have to say is WHY????
Idk he’s too ecstatic
"Another Wonka?
Bonkers."
"""You could change her life, Mr Wonka.
You could change all their lives.
You could give them diabetes."""
Oh god this looks terrible
William wonka without johnny depp😢
"This is good for Mr Beast's chocolate brand Feastables, for something to promote chocolate"
Why it is necessary to have one black person to play the character. There is one who is playing the boss. Why hollywood is so much with the cultural appropriation.😂
OMG YES !!
First go n grab some spice from shaya halud....🌚
"""The producer of Harry Potter""  I am in"
I can smell the wokeness right through the screen.  Pass.
This movie is the entire backstory of Mr Wonka before he made his iconic chocolate factory!
Jesus loves you-!
I see Mr bean there
Sounds like Charlie and the Chocolate factory 💫
Sounds like Charlie and the Chocolate factory 💫
Sigh... Why try to remake something that was already great. They will never make a Wily Wonka better than when Gene Wilder did it.
"Willy seems a little boring if you ask me.  Gene had it perfect, Depp was creepy, and this guy reminds me more of the guy bagging my groceries."
Well well well ....Mr bean is also here....this gonna be a blast 🎉💖😍🥳
Why? Can’t they leave things alone? I doubt this would be Dahl approved and they could have used actual small actors and given them a job.
Too bad it’s not Johnny depp
"Why is Hugh Grant, a 5'11"" actor, playing a part a little person should have???? And why is his head all distorted?? Is that what they think little people look like??"
"Oompa Loompa are dwarfs, cast a dwarf for the role. Also, Oompa Loompas are not 6in tall."
After seeing the trailer even small kid will know the value of Johnny depp no comparison in acting legend for a reason Johnny depp
How did they miss the opportunity to change his signature top hat for a fedora?
Wowowowowowoow
HARD PASS!!!!
I am so excited about NOT watching this movie!!
Can't wait to see this in the cinema when it comes out!
Finally not a traumatic willy wonky movie
i saw the memes of him sounding like alyssa edwards before watching the trailer and now all i can think about is this.
no
Mr bean!!!
"Oh. A black ""girlboss"" sidekick. Trailblazing."
Oh. Another remake. Groundbreaking.
Who Up Wonking They Willy RN
Cringe
"I can tell that kid is trying to imitate Gene Wilder, but he can't even come close.... but all the kids know nothing about Gene Wilder, so they0ll watch it..."
"This looks kinda terrible, I think the only reason they should bring Willy wonky back is if they want to make it a horror movie"
so this is a rip off of what roald dahl created.
i think i will stick with the gene wilder version.
"Doing this movie a third time wont make it any better. Gene did such an amzing job, the whole cast did they had no bussiness redoing it with Depp. And I love Depp in his roles, but the Wonka movie with him was horrible. This looks even worse than that one. And honestly, yall that enjoy this got no taste."
A great Christmas movie
"We need more movies like Joker and Sound of Freedom, controversial and not afraid to offend anyone"
Ok. I'm in on it. 🤓
No.
XD Must black girl xd
0:12 this is not good
It looks terrible
This is like normal Willy wonka but seeing how he makes the factory and how producer from harry poter and Paddington and mr bean actor here 😂😂😂😂😂😂🎉
Black lead or we riot
Its like one more part of harry porter seriess😢😢😂
im sorry but he doesnt fit the outcast lunatic role well
woke garbage not interested
Wow we got a prequel of Charlie and the chocolate factory
I like my chocolate free.
"Maybe we’re just in a cinematic era of everything being a flop, but I just strongly anticipate this to be terrible. Would be good to be wrong for once"
"A great tribute to our first Willy wonka, Gene Wilder"
Truly an incredible movie.. chalamet is the perfect actor for wonka... chalamet face looks like from a fantasy world of disney
Chalamet is indeed a best actor for wonka...
Dear Hollywood..waaaay too soon
No one will ever replace Gene Wilder in this role but still looking forward to this movie
No. Just no.
Timotheé Chocolatemet
"""pull up in a tonka color of willy wonka"""
This is gonna bomb. Then they'll probably dig out and deage Gene's dead corpse. What a creative time we live in
"amazing.
An origin of Willy Wonka.
They didn't show that in Roald Dahl's book.
 1:41, Hello, Mr. Bean!
This is going be the greatest Christmas this year!"
I’m gonna watch it seems amazing
This looks terrible
The world needs this movie
This is cringe af
Another flop movie by Warner Bros. Not because of the movie. It is because of the cursed of Johnny Depp
"Yeah, nah. I don’t like it. 
Completely goes against what Wonka is supposed to be, not secretative at all. Plus I think TC just doesn’t fit Wonka as a character either"
Another lame remake. RIP Hollywood.
Chalamet should stick to playing moody teenagers.  He doesn't have the range for this as an actor.  There is suppose to be a menacing quality to the character of Willy Wonka which he completely lacks.

"Honestly, so glad they cast Chalamet rather than Tom Holland. Seems like a much better fit to me"
"So now it's Chocolatiers of All Lands Unite, you have nothing to lose but your Gumdrop Buttons!"
Look for see this movie
"despite no one asking for a wonka prequel, ill still watch this movie"
No hate but the way he delivers dialogue is so robotic 😂😂😂
eww. no.
"Sir Rowan Atkinson??????

Ok Imma Watch it"
I just can't stand how they won't let Willy Wonka be blonde again.
"This movie could be dogshit, or it could be really fun. As much as I love timothee chalamet, I’m leaning towards dogshit but I hope I’m surprised"
but the cocoa farmers in africa are still living below poverty line
MR BEAN ON THE MOVIE THATS CRAZY !
Johnny dep wonka sucked and this takes too much inspiration from it . Ugh
i would BRAWL a child for a golden ticket
"0:05-0:13 makes me want to do junko poses, and silly cosplay gestures everytime I hear it"
Looks horrible.
Wonkker
Terrible
This is why Hollywood blows.  Make something new please.  Knock it off.  Make something NEW.
"Not a patch on Wilder or Depp, not enough character for the character"
"I'm loving how fantastical and over-the-top this film looks. definitely the wonka we need, I hope they continue this storyline with the same cast and crew all the way to the charlie story arc. I wanna see Timothee's take on ominously teaching the kids a lesson."
Looks terrible
THank God they shoehorned in black people into early 20th century England. Makes perfect sense.
Guys I need to get a haircut how short should I get it?
Just stop. MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL!!!!!!!!
"I dunno, at first I thought this would blow, but seeing as its done by the team who made Paddington (with zero ego), I'm looking forward to this :)"
Missing “Johnny Depp”
"I cant see why people are hating on this moive, it looks great"
Hollywood has run out of new ideas.
I'm surprised Wonka isn't black in this
"Wait a minute.... Hollywood cast Hugh Grant as a dwarf Oompa-Loompa ??  I thought this kind of cis-man stuff didn't fly anymore!  Hollywood is erasing dwarves now ??  First ""Snow White,"" now ""Wonka"" !"
"Can't wait for Wonka: The Chockoverse to come into theaters with the addition of Johnny Depp, Crispin Freeman, and digitized Gene Wilder!"
"this looks dreadful but I guess Im required to watch because of Rowan Atkinson, Keegan Michael etc etc"
"Chalanet is looking ke the poster boy for good content destroyed by culture poisoning WOKE Garbage reinterpretation..Dune..altho visually awesome...garbage..the ACTUAL Willy Wonka,Gene Wilder Willy Wonka is the absolute OPPOSITE of woke cultism...so instead of giving opportunity to work to actually qualified little People,they insert that pos Hugh Grant."
Who here is also experiencing Childhood Nostalgia from watching this?
a 2 hour commercial about functional meth users
Willy Woke and the chocolate factory
let me get that wonkussy
"Why can't they make films without Ne---s and G--s, ???"
"Ugh, Timothy Chalamet is just so wrong for this. Think I’ll skip seeing it."
More WOKE diversity garbage.
doesn't look offensive in any way shape or form but do we really need a prequel though and whats with the cgi again it's so obvious at least make believable cgi scenes. i am guessing they aren't confident with this movie doing very well so they aren't spending real money to make the thing good.
This looks great
Johnson?!
Where's Charlie
Charlie and the chocolate factory ❤is the best ever
I Thought The Oompa Loompa Gets A New Design Now With A 1971 Deisign?
"Like the finest of pralines, this movie has the scent and texture of lukewarm diarrhea."
"Hollywood is OFFICIALLY dead. 
This looks beyond stupid."
I'll pass on this movie
Make new movie ideas and not remakes
I am very excited. I much prefer the Gene Wilder version than Johnny Depp’s version
I love the lack of diversity. I don't see any arabs in this film. Why don't they put my people in films!!
zoomer wonka
I’m just watching this for Mr. Bean
No self-respectable chocolatier would consider white chocolate chocolate.
Cute
"Do little people actually get rolls anymore 🤔 the cgi in the last poor remake, now the little orange singers in this one... then the snow is not white, and the 7 diversity hires."
Again? I feel like we just did this
How can people dislike this its wonderful
Would have been better with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.
This movie looks amazing tbh
"nice, more woke trash with fake oompa lumpas! 


no thanks. pass."
"No, but thank you."
It will succeed
1:02 1:41
eddies
Woke garbage. 🤮🤮💩💩💩
"Kind of reminds me of Perfume: The Story of a Murderer, but with chocolate."
👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 джонні деппа не переплюнути
Фу
WB im surprised its not a blm willy wonka.
man that music BGM was jest awesome

"CGI CGI CGI, and not a f good idea. Another nothing to be forgotten in 1 month"
Quit remaking my favorite childhood movies. The Johnny Depp remake was trash. You can't touch Gene Wilders performance. MAKE AN ORIGINAL IDEA FOR ONCE AND QUIT RIPPING OFF CLASSICS
Dumb
looks boring af
хуйня
Ugh 😑 enough already with the remakes 😕
The original Willy Wonka was Great & loved it! Johnny Depp willy Wonka was magical!! this Wonka is a background story to Willy Wonka!! I'm so stoked for this!!
"When I hear the word chocolate cartel, it sounds like a drug operation like the Pablo Escobar kind."
"Could’ve sworn that the end of the world AND sand monsters came close to killing this guy… but Idk, that’s just me 🤷🏼‍♂️"
"“How do you like it, dark, white, nutty… aBsOlUtElY iNsAnE”"
"Chalamet is so overrated. Movie looks great, but it's having him play the main character is a disappointment."
"OMYGOODNESS I CANT WAIT, We need a Backstory❤❤❤❤❤❤❤"
"Once we started we can't stop 💞..... ""Huh hahh"" ❤🎉🎉🎉"
Johnson!
this looks fun to watch I can't wait🥰
"The reason the little girl never appears in the books or other movies, well, let's just say Wonka went to far in testing what could and couldn't be turned into candy. 

Strange how he's now looking for new kids, with these Golden Tickets.  But perhaps I've said too much."
"I don't quite understand how people say this is a remake? Its clearly a movie before Charlie,  which the other two wonka movies are about.... anyway color me excited! A movie on the glass elevator book next!"
Rowan Atkinson stealing the show with 2 seconds and one line.
"Just finished the movie, I really like the nuclear detonation scene, but the third act skybeam did seem a bit rushed. My favorite part by far has to be when he jumped off the chocolate bridge and Willy Wonka said it's ""Wonka Time!"" and then Wonka'ed all over the place."
Who wanking their willy rn
Nah man I am so unlucky I have my exams at time :( this movie is going to be a masterpiece and also Christmas 🎄
"“Wonka” from the director of “Paddington” & “The Mighty Boosh”, the writer of “Paddington 2”, & the producer of “Harry Potter”, “Paddington”, “Fantastic Beasts”, “Gravity”, “Marriage Story”, “Juice”, “Yes Man”,"
I saw mr bean
how did they pull this off? legit looks better than the original
this looks so good!!!!
"This is awesome!!I had no idea about this 
🥰🍫"
Wonka a pedo living with a random black child
Timothee Chalamet is giving very strong Onceler vibes from The Lorax omggg
Sorry I found Johnny deep replica as wonka
Looks good but Timothee chalamet was not the right choice
Timothy challamet amg ❤
Love the story by Roald Dahl but you just can't improve on the original Willy Wonka movie (1971) with Gene Wilder ~ it's a classic!
"I think them making Willy Wonka movies multiple times is cool, I’m very VERY excited for this movie. I don’t care what people say. I’m excited and I love how different all 3 movies are from each other and how they play off the book’s differently. Also to anyone reading this go see a Willy Wonka (JR) play. They are amazing and I got the honor of being in one of them. It was so fun and so magical and this movie brings me back to being a little kid and watching the original movie with my parents."
Warner Bros on fire 🔥🔥
Is this a sequel to the orig Charlie and the chocolate factory
Whos wonkin they willy rn
Willy wonka is such a hard kind of character to pull off without coming across as creepy or cringey. It’s actually a miracle it worked so well in the first place.
Omg! I can't wait!!
Naaaa. Where's the factory
"kaget gw tib2 ada kata harry potter, ternyata produsernya"
Another Wonka movie is like another Joker movie. Except you don’t like that version of Joker.
Hugh Grant has no problem getting acting roles. Give the oompa-loompa roles to the little people. Wtf?!
Makes the Johnny Depp look like a pro.
This looks like an SNL satire
Looks absolute shite!
Dope
There can be only one Willy Wonka - RIP Gene Wilder
"What about the lead actor scares me, makes me uncomfortable?

He's too much so something, or not enough of something else. ""Look at me I'm made for camera"" ewww"
This movie is giving me a lot of Harry Potter/ Fantastic Beasts vibes
Its wonkorbin' time!
MR. BEAN!!!!
this looks corny af. Im not seeing it cause im not ruining the first movie .
I’m not watching it fam I’m perfectly content with the two wonka movies this looks absolutely horrible 🤮
He's the best man for the role😩
This Wonka before get success for him chocolate company
This aint it
"I wish someone would film the sequel to Dahl's book _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory._

_Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator_ is actually much funnier, but no one's ever filmed it"
You understand how over the top brilliant Johnny Depp was in this role when you see a really good actor like Timothy perform it and not getting even close
This could be very good or another nothing burger that ranges from pissing people off or just being ignored. But the daydreaming joke and flying scene give me some hope that it will be a Roald Dahl fantasy humor. So not holding my breath but I'll check it out
"Hmmm, not sure how i feel on this. The movie looks fun and seems like a good origin story for the Gene Wilder version of the film, but then i very cynical about movie studios rehashing old ideas and lacking any originality, which this movie to me on first impression looks like it it will do mostly faithful as an origin story....but again, the movie will not be original and a new creation, it might just be a skinsuit of nostalgia."
SEATED FOR THIS!
Sad to see Little ppl r angry hopefully they get over it before the movie comes out.
timothy chalamet isn’t giving wonka. not even a crumb
"I've watched this trailer about *5 times* now! At first, when I heard about this, I was all, ""Meh"". 😒 But when I saw this for this 1st time, my expression IMMEDIATELY changed to 😳 and I got a *BIGGEST* crush on Timothee ChalametM now!!! 😃😍

I am *DEFINITELY* wanting/going to see this in theaters! SUPER EXCITING!!!! 😁"
"Do you guys know, ehike inly being 13% kf the population, a crrtain type is of person is over 50% of roles in new movies? Why?"
"Looks frigging terrible. Then again, it'll fit right in with majority of movies made today. Hollywood is dying a slow painful death."
"It looks very boring, I don't even want to see the trailer   3/10"
why is the mother look luke paddington mother
Hugh Grant is playing a Oompa Loompa in Wonka
"Why tamper with perfection? 

This is not a movie you can remake into a better one, so don't bother remaking it."
He cant replace the real wonka.
It’s been 52 years since the Gene Wilder version and 18 years since the Johnny Depp version
No just no
Wow nice movie...❤❤
Why?
Jhonny depp 😢
Who wonking up their willy rn??
"Oh boy, I can'wait for the remake 2 years from now."
Let me guess - black girl will be one of the two main characters equal to WW?
looks shite
I'm excited
"Just came from woke Disney's Brown ""Snow"" White and what a refreshing change!"
"They did it again, a waaaaay too long trailer that makes me feel like I watched the whole thing (not watching the movie anymore)"
woke ah willy wonka. i hope it flops
Its so bad there is no way
gwapo nya
Is willy wonka a magical candy maker?
SOMEONE TELL ME WHEN ITS OFFICIAL
Looks terrible
It's gonna be great if Jhonny deep as Wonka
It's gonna be great if Jhonny deep as Wonka
It's gonna be great if Jhonny deep as Wonka
1:02 Mr bean is actually in the movie yeah im definitely watching it now
What a very 2023 movie
Jhonny depp 😭😭
Love it already
"Gene Wilder did this already. It was fantastic! Wasn't Johnny Depp in one before this one? 
Still, as usual, here comes Hollywood green lighting yet ANOTHER remake unnecessarily. 
I don't wish ill will towards all that made this movie. But, as an audience member, no thanks."
"Here we go, mama"
PEAKKK
"I think this actually looks great, very magical and a new story of a character we love. I have a question though, does anyone think that Timothee Chalamet is a bit soft spoken for Wonka, or is that just me?"
"“From the producers of Harry Potter”
Now I’m NOT going to watch the movie."
This movie looks kinda wonkey
I like this only because it has a different plot then the other two movies
"It seems Wonka has nothing to do with Charlie and the chocolate factory, which is not disturbing as the first movie."
I can't forget Willy Wonka's character from Johnny Deep
"Oh my god this looks awful, im so excited!!"
I love how roman aka mr bean is in this movie
ayo is that daniel thrasher!? jk
Is it just me or does the actor who plays Wonka look kind of like Daniel thrasher
"Willy Wonka looks like a normal person, maybe he make it more realistic ver of wonka"
THIS IS SO BAD EHHH
Cannot wait for this to come out!
Was there ever a black character in the original? I think NOT.
I was afraid this would be horrible but it actually might be kinda alright.
MY MAN Rowan Atkinson @ 10:03
Oh brother they sure Love remaking classics just to mess things up
I really hope this is good!
Ruined this movie too! Stop ruining movies!!!!
We dont need another willy wonka movie
Here for mr bean ❤
no thanks
"Ew. Gene made it iconic. Depp had a believability about himself as Willy Wonka. I always thought Timothee is just the 'it' boy in Hollywood that everyone is trying to push and while some are crazy about him, this kind of is another example why he is not a good actor. It feels like pretend, in a high school play type of way. All the good and great actors can make you believe they are that character... Timothee just looks out of his element entirely. He's more suited for less lines, vogue style faces lol, and no need to show any emotion. This also did not need another movie. Hollywood is creatively bankrupt."
How far have they fallen casting this kid in a role Wilder made immortal? At least Depp had the crazy eyes. This kid has nothing.
its so funny that warner wont get any promotion from the cast. hope the strike lasts well into december...
Can't wait to see the blueberry inflation!
He looks like he’s about to pace the pews in a church corridor!
Pov: it’s the year 2030 and we are looking back at this peak trailer
Give me chocolate!
Gee what a nice dude. Hope he doesn’t end up sending children down garbage shoots or up chocolate pipes or stretching them or blowing them up
This movie did not need a sequel💀
Missing depp
"Sinto cheiro de Oscar, apesar de Oppenheimer  a frente"
This looks so good. His exaggerated expressions and movements definitely remind me of Gene and his chaotic Wonka interpretation.
Alan johnsons beamer
"I came here bc I heard ppl don't like his acting and I sorta agree if the whole movie is like this it's like someone has a gun to his head and telling him to be Willy Wonka... It's a guy pretending to be Willy Wonka not Wonka. I hope the actual movie is better and his acting is better than what is shown here
EDIT: The more Ive watched this trailer the more I like it and have high hopes for it! Still worried about it being a kids movie. But less worried about Wonka!"
I love that this is the Pre-quil that hasn't been told in depth.
why is lil mabu playing willy wonka
Looks fun enough. Grant as an oompa is gold lol
Idk this might reek of modern influence and it already is. I’d be lying if I said I’m not worried about this movie but it doesn’t look bad by any means
Harry Potter
WHY
Whyyyyyyyy
people are saying that this looks like it sucks but it actually looks quite good!
Nice to see that it's not just another remake of the classic movie.  Looks interesting.
Good job Hollywood. Another remake due to no creativity for new movies! lol
"LG boy another shoveled out unwanted prequel TV show no one asked for for a movie that didn't need one based off a book with a sequel that's much better deserving of an adaptation.

I'll pass.

I'll pass"
"Looks like they hollywooded tf out of this, and thats not a compliment.."
Surprised Willy Wonka isn't black
"I loved the part when he said ""It's wonkain time"""
barbie oppenheimer now this we are definetely eating good4
What the fish! What genetic is the Oompa Loompa?
01:01 mr. Bean is that you?
"i don't like chalamet in this role, he's trying too hard to be johnny depp"
I don’t see how it could be worse than the Tim Burton version
Sure why not
There's gonna be a post credit scene about a golden ticket isn't there? 😂
Жопка
"I loved the part at the end where he said, ""Roads?, where we are going Marty, we don't need roads..."""
Giving young Gene Wilder Vibes.... I'm here for it 🙂
🔥
Classic will always be the best
"""no daydreaming”
3$ fine
I would lose so much cash for that😂"
Noo waayyy
"There is something about how he says his lines. Stiff, unnatural. Maybe it's because Depp was playful when he said his"
I can't wait to do this musical fantasy about life and adventures of willy Wonka because it's coming to theatres on December 2023.
I'm so glad they are finally doing something original in Hollywood.
why are all these comments positive? this looks like absolute dogshit
Another rehashed movie! There seems to be no new ideas in Hollywood!
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
I love there are no blacks in the future. Willy Wonka turned them all into chocolate.
Not the movie we wanted but the one we needed
"He was better in Dune, they cast the wrong guy for Willy Wonka."
this looks so trash... what an awful portray of willy wonka. why is he so cringe in this movie
That looks like it's going to be so good!
"As usual, a great little story trashed by Hollywood."
Not exactly my type of movie but I love Timothée so I mean 🤷‍♀️
"Please tell me this is willy wonka in young, if not i'm gonna cry"
WILLY WONKA IS BRITISH
This better be heat
Wait is that mr bean?😂
why does the ompa lompaa sounds like brian from family guy?
this trailer brings back good memories of the movie charlie and the chocolate factory 💗💗💗
I hope Timothee Chalamet was famous voice of Wonka.
I think that Timothe is going to be so good in this movie
They’ve run out of ideas
A movie about enterpreneurship. Precisely what we need the most nowadays. I love it. And it looks awesome too!
What is this...
"I'm about to see this, this looks great"
why?
Here we go mama…tear😢
"....something is missing 😕 I mean, I know it's gonna be a great movie for some people, but for me, the previous ones are just too good. It had more eccentricity, character, and depth. This will not replace or is better than the previous Willy Wonka movies, but I'm sure it has its own audience and a different Willy Wonka story. With that being said, it's a pass from me."
king henry making chocolates..
0:50 amogus
"I've spent⌛  the past seven7⃣  years traveling🧳  the world 🌍 perfecting my craft. You 🫵 see👀 I'm something of a magician🪄 , inventor👨‍💻 , and chocolate🍫 maker, so quiet🤫 up☝ and listen👂down👇 , nope🙅‍♂ scratch that☝ , reverse◀  it☝ ."
I hate it when they add black people in a movie thats suppose to be set in the early 1900's
Pass.  The original and Johnny Depp version will still be better.
I can’t wait to see it
so excited for this
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory already has a remake. We don't need the Threequal.
"This looks so good, can’t wait to watch it"
"Probably like most woke trash being produced today, they will include many hints and nods and the best nuances inspired from the first movie.  Like the flute sound."
"🎵 ""Come with me, and you'll be, in a world of pure regurgitation!  Creative-free!  It lacks imagination!""🎶"
and another cash grab
Woke Willy Wonka
I liked the part where all the bots composed fake approval comments that were artificially stacked at the top of the list.
Looks like trash.
I can't wait to not see this!
there is mr. beannnn
to whom he gave his æss to get this role?
Timothée Chalamet est un EXCELLENT acteur et DIGNE d'endosser le rôle que notre Roi 👑 ADORÉ ❤ avait endossé il y a des années. Je me réjouis d'aller voir ce film 🤗
textbook overacting and not enough energy to fit the role i cringed after every line he said and am fully expecting this to flop
Why are they making this movie again?
OMG ITS THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORES 😆
Tim is so f-ing boring to watch and has a monotone low voice.   THAT is NOT Willy Wonka...
Oh no.
WHY IS THIS RATBOY GOT THIS ROLE 🤢🤢🤢👎🏻👎🏻👎🏻 OHH HES BEEN F’D IN THE A$$ BY HOLLYWEIRD OFFICIALS
"directed by the people who made Paddington?? yes please! I also realised that Sally Hawkins is in this movie, who played the role of Mrs. Mary brown- in Paddington. awesome!"
Wonka again????
I hope it's not a musical ughh
This looks dumb
"How is it not the same when an actor does blackface 
And an actor pretends to be a dwarf. There are plenty of dwarf actors who want these roles"
"After watching the trailer I personally think that Timothée maybe would've felt more comfortable, and as a result his portrayal of a character like Wonka would've appear more natural and charming, if he'd already had experience with playing these type of characters in the past, but unfortunately he doesn't, so this is pretty new to him and for us to see him like this; and maybe this,as a whole combination, adds to this dislike that some people has of his performance of this character. 
But I'm personality waiting to see the whole movie to have a definite opinion on if I actually like him as the new Wonka or not.
At least for now the trailer looks great to me."
"Wow, cool cool cool cool"
"""Absolutely insane"" and that head twist was perfect, it might make this guy actually a good Wonka."
"Since when did Charlie and the chocolate factory get a black girl with an afro? This movie is going to bomb hard with viewers.  First, why remake Gene Wilder's magnificent job of acting in Willy Wonka? Can't anyone write a new script? This movie is going to bomb at the box office."
Wow another movie where they take roles from dwarf actors and give to normal actors.
"You do realize you're supposed to get better the more times you do something, not progressively worse."
"That's not the original willy wonka, that's Charlie after he inherited the chocolate factory."
Is that Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka? 0_0
Hollywood is dead
Ehhhhh....give me Gene Wilder over this mess any day
still not better than jhoony deep
ya quiero verlo!!
cant wait to hear this story be told once more
No thank you
i wanna see it it looks fun tbh🥰
"Please don't be a woke bait and switch. I'd like to love this film. While I miss Deep Roy in the part, I have to say Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was the best part of the trailer."
0:19
"Another flop I c, looks terrible af!"
timmy’s kinda eating this up 😛
This looks good y’all tripping !
The Chocolate must flow!
Not woke enough!
so Disney hates little people I guess they can't even cast them here and instead use hugh friggin grant I'm so done with Disney and there ever expanding agendas instead of telling good stories for stories sake. a great character should be a fluid thing not a forced down your throat.
I Don't see Charlie's grandpa here 😂😂😂
the quiet kid. he probably gets it
I hope the cinema has got a 32'' plasma. You get a film up on that baby and you are seriously looking at that movie
I honestly would rather know how Charlie bucket did running the factory after all these years
This trailer looks absolutely awful. The guy playing Willy Wonka might be the worst actor I’ve ever seen.
Im a lot more excited about this movie and FNAF over Barbie and Oppenheimer any day. Can't wait to see the Willie Wonka prequel. Hopefully it'll be good. 😎😎
Looks god awful
This looks great!
This looks amazing can’t wait for it to come out!!!
Definitely giving a pass on this. Doesn’t look good.
The house of Atreides has come far
this looks 💩
Seeing this reminds me of the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that I watched as a child.
Timothy looks SPECTACULAR in this! More than he did in Dune.
Pass. There is the original and that is all this movie should’ve never been re-created or retold. And I can care less about a prequel.
Boooo
This looks very cringe...
"Normal people : This movie looks bad because—
Conservatives : Wokeness !
Normal people : Uh…..🫤"
Stupid movie
This looks terrible.......
I wanna see this just for the pure sillyness of it 🤣
"I don' get the hate. yeah a bunch of parts seem cringy, but hopefully that's just because they're out of the context of the world that they're setting up in the movie. I really liked the paddington movies."
he looks like lil mabu💀💀
1:03 Mr BEEEAAAN
"WOAH! OKAY, GOING IN  A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH THE WHOLE WONKA THING BUT ALRIGHT. 🤷🏻‍♂️😅"
this looks horrendous
"Again the magic of Willy Wonka was captured not in special effects but by the brilliance of Gene Wilder.  The main actor is weak, his voice is not commanding and not inspirational.  This is another tawdry example of a beloved story that is once again bastardized for profit."
SMH I was like where the umpa lumpas then I was like yessss they are my all time favorite movie characters
No golden ticket whyyyy😢😢😮😅
Mr. Bean!!!!!! 🙌✨💖  I don’t know how I feel about someone being with Willy from the beginning…and a child at that..🤔
would definitely watch this
At least we still have the Umpa loompas
This is going to be like a prequel to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I.e. a story of how Willy Wonka have a chocolate factory.
"I guess he who controls the spice, also controls the sugar… controls the universe"
"So when Hollywood runs out of pre existing movies, TV, shows and IP’s to adapt, remake or create sequels and prequels to because most studios largely spent decades ignoring the need to create new content, then what?"
No Depp no Buck!
Nostalgia
Timothy Chamalet has the charisma of a concrete wall.
This movie comes out the day after my birthday! Might treat my self by watching it with my family!
Johnny is Johnny nobody can replace him.
Anyone else sad that Gene Wilder isn’t around to see this 😔
nobody asked for this
They had me at Paddington.
"I love the change in the story, instead of the classic story we all know, it’s something knew. It’s sort-of a prequel to the second movie as it’s how Willy started which was talked about near the beginning of that movie. They could have done the great-glass elevator as it’s an actual book like Charlie and the chocolate factory but this is a great new story."
idk...
Movie looks like trash.
Something tells me rowan atkinson applied for the role of Willy wonka and got denied for not being able to franchise the movie. He would be the greatest Willy ever.
"A beautiful woman, is lyke looking @a succulent steak! No matter how much you eat-it, it still looks good, & no matter how much you 💩it-out, it still taste good!

If you don’t see the problem with that, then congratulations, you’re either a woman, & or a real “heterosexual man!” 

#EverlastingGobstoppersShouldBeASecretServiceReservedExclusivelyForKidsScienceFictionWillyWonkaAndOrTheChocolateFactory"
Another little black orphan movie. Hard pass.
Some characters do not need a backstory
"On the BBC news website someone is complaining that Hugh Grant is cast as an Oompa Loompa but isn't a dwarf, I didn't hear anything about no dwarfs being cast in the new Snow White film though, how odd. Or is it?"
"Gotta hand it to them, its a great strap-line.
*""How Willy became WOKER.""*
'couch,' I mean WONKER. 🤪"
This is just as mid as it gets
Should've called it Willy Woker by the looks of it.
finally a movie with no love interest
Is that Mr.Bean at 1:02 🤧
No Johnny Depp? Nope for me
"I need a refresher.

Is this the Kid in the Will Wonkas chocolate factory and he’s all grown up? Is this a reboot a prequel or a Sequel or both of either of the 2?"
This must end with a mind erasure candy
It's Wonkin' time!
Wow the Dune sequel is a lot more colorful.
Wait No Johhny? No Me!
"Nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity"
ROWAN ATKINSON LEZZZ GOOOO
"Mr. Bean is back !!!!!!
Woohoooooo
Lets gooooo"
This is dumb
I hope this one wouldn’t be so disappointing
snow piercer pls
Cant wait to watch the movie with my family!!!
"""Nothing to see here! Just a small group of people defying gravity"" I hope the whole movie has me laughing this much."
Pinkie promise this movie will be everything i want it to be!!!
Mathew Baynton being cast as the Ficklegruber is not something we wanted but something we needed
👍
👍
Something tells me this movie is going to be hot garbage
I don't get the bad reviews on this. It looks fine/good
"Why won't they do a movie about the sequel, The Glass Elevator?"
Mr. Bean is here
Yeeeyy the story of Mr. WONKA
Nice
Bro why did they make winks so fine for?
"I'm sorry but....this does not look interesting. Timothee Chalamet was not a good choice, he's overacting in many parts of this and at times just looks psychotic. And frankly, making a prequel to the classic film was already a terrible idea. Prequels just answer questions that no one asked and create many plot holes for the the original movie. Take the Oompa Loompa for example. It's always been that Willy Wonka had human workers before closing down the factory, then later he found the Oompa Loompas and reopened the factory. Here, he seems to be getting them from the beginning? 

This is not going to be a good movie."
NOT THE CHICOLATE CARTELL 😂😂😂💀💀💀
Looks awful
Why is he white
I’m sure it’s woke. Time to go broke
Literally a origin story to gene Wilders willy Wonka
1:41  MR.BEAN😍
Kill me now
"I’m sorry but this looks like just another cheesy, soulless, Hollywood franchise cash in with bad CGI. Me personally, I don’t think I need to go watch this."
This looks corny af
"Fantastic beast but chocolate. 
This looks very cynical and how to make a buck called it all along"
This gave me the chillbumps
Eh. Ok
Is he selling chocolate or delta gummies that make you so high you fly??
*millenial*
"quiet up and listen down… nope! scratch that, reverse it!"
Idc what y’all say I think this actually looks good
This looks so cute!!!! In the mood for the holidays now and it's July! lol
The colors feel dim.
Oh yeah this is gonna be bad
3 Willy wonka
why does it feel like one of those generic 2014 Disney prequel movies?
"“1971”
“2005”
“2013”
“2023”"
"0:11
“Bop it! Pull it! Twist it!”"
Okay Timothy as Wonka is ❤
cringe
'Chocolate Cartel' is never something i ever thought id hear but im here for it
Nobody gonna beat Johnny Deep
"Gotta love yet another remake of Willy Wonka that will fail miserably compared to the original. Why? Because they obviously don't understand what made the original so amazing - Gene Wilder. More specifically, his wit and humor. So now, we have some cheap remake from todays most popular young male actor that will have the same bland writing that all Hollywood does now. 
Yet another astonishing example of mediocrity kicking a dead horse for money. I don't care how nice and feel good the message is, they are missing the whole damned point."
I bet Mulaney is furious..
Who saw Hugh Grant and thought Oompa Loompa
Didn't Johnny Depp already ruin this?
"This looks great, I'm so excited to see it!"
"Hm... No blatantly character bashing with Wonka? Not something I expected in a modern film with the obsessive ""reimagining"" so here take my skeptical optimism."
mmmmm. nah I'm good
Wonkas canon event
The new Dune movie really is a departure from the first one....
"He he said ""it's Wonkin' time!"" my jaw dropped to the bottom of the Mariana Trench!"
A 3rd WONKA MOVIE!!!
Surprised Willy wonka isn’t black 😂😂
"""You know I'm something of a scientiest myself."""
GETTING RELEASED RIGHT AFTER MY BRITHDAY!!
*LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOUR THINK THAT ARIES ARE AWESOME *
Can't wait to see this movie. 💕
"Hmmmmm not about this, Wilder still set the bar on this character to a level that most cannot reach"
what the heck
black
"They've remade an adult movie by making it a prequel, it's for kids because it's about #candy"
"First Mission Impossible, Oppenheimer, Barbie and now Wonka? Wonderful."
"Idk, thought this trailer was oretty wonky at places."
Isn’t Willy wonka a pedo?
"Brings a tear to my eye. This is actually how the best chocolate in the world started out, not from forced labor in third world countries, but a purple-suited clown with dreams of flying in the air. It's such a powerful message."
I don't understand why people are hating on this he's not over acting and even if they did a lot of different versions of the movie its different in it's own way like I think it will be worth watching
"He's not even acting, he's just talking 😭"
"Still bummer that they didn't include Pure Imagination to be a soundtrack, or did they?"
Wow more forced diversity! Very much a shame!
Nah pls Tell me it's not just me cuz this trailer is too goofy
why they only cast the same top actors
WB 💙🤍💙🙌🏼
Its Fred in another life.
MR BEAN
I smell more woke bs
looks awful.
"Willy Wonka, but it's not the same."
Lmao Gonna be huge flop
Giggity
Does anyone miss johny depp? Coz i doo
The move is not even out yet and we already have conservatives crying about “wokeness” and how black actors in media will ruin their lives…
Wait is that Timothée Chalamet or Daniel Thrasher?
Narkotyki w czekoladzie
Anyway you guys can come up with an original idea for a movie??
NOOOOO I WANT JOHNNY WONKA
In other parallel world willy wanka I watch it🤓🤓
He was real good in bones and all.
Willy Wonka accent is wrong! He is British
I just vomited a little in my mouth...
Gene wilder is the only willy wonka
All the bots in the comments are really excited to see this movie
I actually like the trailer! Can’t wait to see it ❤
I want Johnny Depp back!
Why.???
Looks like another American dream story. And all this dancing and flying is just soooo boring. The movie looks like a flop to me
"I like the part at the end were he goes ""it's wonkin time"", classic"
So… we’re now making normal sized people small folks? Like their roles aren’t limited anyways
This looks more like Marry Poppins than Willy Wonka.
hahahahaha
Is he acting or being a clown?
Jonny Depp another level 😅
"No day dreaming!

£5 penalty 


😂😂"
I am going to watch this movie and I’m going to love this movie
What tf is this.
What a stellar cast!!
Epic
"This actually looks like it'll be quite good, and I don't usually say that about stuff."
I don’t think Willy wonka needs a 3rd movie
I am missing Johnny Depp 😞
OMGG
MATT BAYNTON YOSSSSSSSS
OMG I CAN'T WAIT THIS SEEMS LIKE A GREAT MOVIE
"Where is Jim Carrey, he should have been in this movie."
The actor for wonka is like a mix of Daniel thrasher and a bit of matpat
I love how they basically incorporated both willy wonkas into one
He’s the kwisatz haderach of chocolate making
"So, the little boy now has to be a little black girl (of course). 😆 Why do they keep remaking films that don't need remade, and blackwashing and race swapping characters that weren't made that way? Not even Johnny Depp's version can't touch Gene Wilder in the original. The reviews arent gonna be nice. The main actor, however, looks great in his part."
"Ah yes, they made Wonka into a 16 year old."
Yo I'm excited
This Wonka isn’t unsettling and creepy like the Johnny Depp version. I appreciate that.
"Media exec: “guys we have no ideas, so make a wonka prequel and get me some money!”
Staff: “oh sure a wonka movie will definitely make a money”
Media exec: “why did you say that weird?”"
I get there trying to capture Gene Wilders Willy Wonka but the only thing in my head right now is Christian Boyles Wonka
Timmy nailed it
Why is there a blk girl?
"0:03 “Dear Wonka, why do you wear a top hat and colorful suit?” “Dear Wonka, why do Oompa Loompas work for you?” “How did you make your first candy?” “How do you come up with new flavors?” Now, hold on. Hold on. This movie can answer all your questions!"
Holy botted comment section!!
"Seriously? A black side kick? Had to cram that in there ehh? Every single time. The J tricks never end 14

Embrace your folk. Your heritage. Your traditions. These are all European stories. Never forget. 14"
is hollywood out of ideas?
HOW IS THIS FR
Omg
Nope. Not going to waste time or money on this. The original is perfection. Sick of Hollywood destroying the classics.
？？？
A Young Wonka before he got his Factory this is Awesome!!
Isn't as elegant as Johnny Depp. Lacks charisma.
"I loved it when he said ""It's Wonking Time"" and Wonked all over the screen, one of the movie moments of all time."
Really do hope they don't mess up my childhood
Timothy Chardonnay can't act.
I can’t wait!!!!!!! 🥹
I like Timothy but just by this trailer his acting looks really terrible
Nah
Why do they keep remaking this movie?
"they get younger and younger




weirdly"
Idk why people are dissing on the movie. It’s not even a remake it’s more of a back story to how Wonka started his factory. It’s reminds me of The Greatest Showman
w oompa LOOMPA
Is this before he became absolutely insane? because Timothy has the right look but O dnt think he's capturing Wonka's essence right.
Ayo ngl willy be looking like the perfect twink
Warnerbros is the best. This is amazing. WB Forever
Finally 😭😭😭😭😭😍😍😍
"1:41 Teletubbies reference!









What I mean is… Dipsy shouted “RUN AWAY!!!” when he was being chased by Laa-Laa who is forcing Dipsy to wear the skirt."
The opportunity to hear Hugh Grant sing will be worth the price of admission alone.
gene wilder and johnny depp had a much more sarcastic and funny attitude. i don’t see timothy fitting in well with this movie
Stop remaking movies come out with some different ideas
"multiverso filme live action dc comics james gunn
the flash
superman legacy
batman the brave and the bold
dc amazonas a origem
harley quinn 2
lanterna verde detetive
liga da justiça vs authority
supergirl a mulher do amanhã
monstro do pântano terror
dc lobo
batgirl cassandra cain
esquadrão suicida 3
batman vs ben 10
homem-animal
os jovens titãs
grande barda"
Bro idk why people  are hating on the trailer it’s not bad it seems like a nice movie
Was Johnny Depp too old?
"MBMBAM made me thing this wasnt gonna be real. But nope, I need it."
"1:24 is bath spa, remember seeing the fake snow at Christmas 2021 with all the extras and the exact vehicle props, so surreal seeing it come to life"
I can’t watch this even if I wanted too because I cannot see Paul Atreides in any other light than what I currently see him in. Even watching this trailer is playing with fire.
We didn’t need this
He don’t fit da wonka aesthetic he’s a great actor nonetheless. Def gonna hate this movie so I’m just not gonna watch it
Жопка ❤
White guy with black girl again. So obvious the media is pushing this hard.... but why
Nick Cage should play Willy Wonka. This kid looks too young!
ummm... copying mikes mic much!
Woke Wonka will wither away!
Thought it was gonna be weak like the last one but this looks dope tbh
Amazing 😍😍 movie
Im excited honestly. The team sounds great!
"New Wonka coming in like Jack Sparrow on a ship: ""I've spend the past 7 years traveling the world, perfecting my craft to try and become Johnny Depp.""
He might need a little more work."
0:23 That lightning bolt looks like Shazam logo.
Chalamet as a Wanka Johnny never regrets!
"Someone didn't have the right idea for the movie.  Its true what they say, less is more."
Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over. Thank you Roald Dahl.
Continually refusing to cast midgets in fear of upsetting midgets is always amusing
I’m so freaking excited!
"No one can beat the action of the real willy wonka ""Jonny Depp"" he is a class"
Hollywood has officially gone too far... burn it.
"Instead of remakes/retelling of this story, I'm still waiting for a proper sequel showing what happens after Charlie inherited the chocolate factory."
mr.bean as cameo 1:40
This looks awesome 😎
this is going to be very hit or miss
I still love to see Sir Christopher Lee as Willy's father 🥰
Wouldn't it be cool if a younger version of Charlie's grandfather appeared in this movie
Nice
"Hollywood is too scared to actually cast small people for roles that they would excel in, thus leaving already challenged and underworked actors with even more challenges and even less work. This isn't about being politically correct, its about appeasing the insatiable hive mind. This new trend of excluding small people is a spit in the face to those who would bring life to these roles, more than any laughable CGI could ever do. The self proclaimed ""progressive"" continue to be regressive in every way possible."
"Remember this is not Burtom version, this is coming from the first version of Wonka !!!!!!!!!"
Is that a Jack Dylan Grazer?
"I must say I am a Dahl book/Wilder loyalist but this actually looks pretty great.  Silly, and quite visually beautiful.  I’m sure there will be lots of awful eyeroll moments but this looks pretty cool on the whole."
I thought willy wonka acted like mad hatter 😂🤣
This is going to be garbage.
"Another woke production. We already have a Wonka movie, which I don't think can be surpassed."
I love how this is 100% a Christmas movie without being about actual Christmas. The outfits and whole aesthetic. Christmas was definitely the vibe they where going for!
"Rowan atkinson is back, the legend  is here. 🥲🍻🥂🥂🥂"
"Ahhh, kan't wait 😍"
STILL NOT LIKE JOHNNY DEPP
This looks stupid!!! The chocolate cartel?😂. Gtfoh wont even waste my time
いいね
Omg mr bean ❤
"""From the director of Paddington"" literally sold"
A tHIrD WonKa mOvIE
"1:29 Always love an ""epic"" version of a classic theme tune, even if I've only heard it about twice in my life."
They probably changed the whole plot of the movie to fit in a minority main character
"If it's directed by the director of Paddington, this HAS to be good!"
TIMOTHEEEEEE
Not a good actor
It looked stupid but fun
No
"At this point, I'm just glad Chris Pratt isn't in it."
Why? Just...why?
"Timothy Chalame, an actor with charming colors❤❤❤"
Just excuse me while I go fangirl in the corner
Charlie in a chocolate factory  That is very nice  I have each chocolate in Christmas and  Halloween and  Valentine 🍩 🍪
Why do I feel like this is gonna be a flop
Is that just me or was that Rowan Arkinson? 1:40
بابا بسه دیگه جمع بشید یه فیلم درست حسابی درست کنید اینا دیگه چه سمی
I miss Johnny 🥺
"i just knew they had to enclude a black child cause of ""diversity"""
Old wonka so good but this one 😢
i have to see this now bruhhhhhh
When Timothee Chalamet grabbed that nut I was sure i was going to watch this movie.
God I hate Hollywood now more than ever...
who up wonkin they willy rn?
"My favorite part of the trailer was when he said ""it's wonkin time"" and then willy wonked all over the place."
"У этого человека нет харизмы Джонни,  это провал"
I like Chalamet but I'm sorry he's just not the guy for this role. Just like Tom Holland wasn't the guy for the role of Nathan in Uncharted.
Way too many nigs I'm out
I love the oompa loompa ahaha. Although it's kinda strange seeing the difference in Tom's performance vs Jonny depps back then
east or west johnny depp is the best
I have a good feeling about this one
wtf why isn't wonka black this time reported
"It's unbelievable they already did a prequel telling the story of Paul Atreides. Man, it's way before he fights the Harkonnens but boi does it feel very natural ngl"
So is this what WB is replacing Fantastic Beasts with?
"The Late Gene Wilder would be approved🌹Can't Film This For Wait-What opps Strike That Reverse It-Can't Wait For this Film, It Will Be Scrumdeliumcoussss! 😃😁❤👌"
The background song of candycrush makes it nostalgic
"Looks nothing like the book or the spirit of Roald Dahl.  Willy Wokea.
Sad to something else destroyed."
"Can't wait to see the underground sandworm habitat to produce ""Wonka's Special Spice Slip of Silly."""
Another wb cash grab. Gross
"Director: Tim, we need you need to study willy wonka for this upcoming movie
Tim: *loads up @danielthrasher channel* say no more"
This film looks a little wonky.
this i have to see when it comes out
Where did the black girl come from???!!!
"This guy is following in some massive footsteps. He's collecting a role played by two incredible actors, Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp. Good luck, kid."
awwwww
So this is what Paul Atreides would've done if he'd left Dune after his dad's death.
"I don’t like what I see, but I’ll watch it anyway…I guess that’s any movie they make with The Chalamet"
scratch that! reverse it!
I really wish he has real magical powers and not a regular mortal.
"Well, at least it's not called Willy"
he is going to do a good job
timmy t amo
Nice
"It's exciting, but he looks so independent from the two previous interpretations by Gene and Johnny😢"
i just saw mr. bean!
"Not another wonka! Yuck! Come on Hollywood, get some new ideas. Not wasting my money."
"Anyone else hearing ""I chimed in with a haven't you people ever heard of, closing the god damned door?"""
young actors have zero charisma nowadays.  horrible acting....boring
Gene Wilder and Julie Dawn Cole are the best no contest. Never how many reboots will never compare
The original is the greatest movie ever made. Johnny Depp was not good in the remake. Glad we're getting a prequel 🙌🏾👏🏾🙌🏾👏🏾
johnny depp batter
This is very different from the old one like it is one of my favs from childhood
i havent felt such joy since despicle me... gru forever baby ✌
"This actually looks like a fun family movie to watch, it's been way too long my dear friend."
Mr bean got a new job
Oh look…. Another diversity movie with the token black kid and overhyped orchestral background music to a TERRIBLY written script (I’m assuming is written/produced by AI) and will most likely bomb. I’m seriously suspicious with this big studios……
"Who is that child, and why is that adult man hanging out with her?"
Oh gosh idk
im just here to say.....no
... Think I'll pass on this one.
This is so ✨dis-knee✨ channel lmao 😭😭
Willy wonka and the chocolate community
I might like this
Casting Timothée as Wonka is a total fail. I love him as an actor but he doesn’t match the Wonka personality people grew up loving.
"This is going to be EPIC!!!!!  perfection GGs WP...Timothy is the perfect casting choice! Brilliant, this is young JD, Edward Scissor Hands, Benny & Joon vibes! brava 👏🏼"
"Here we go again. Forcing out white people from white culture and jamming black people in our place. 
Surprised they didn't race swop Willie himself for a black woman."
"The way Wonka is portrayed in this trailer, feels very ""He was cast because he is a popular name and the studio hopes it will sell the film."" and not that he had to audition against tons of other actors for this role.  Especially if he's portraying the Gene Wilder Wonka.  I don't get the whimsy from him like from Wilder, he just seems like the usual good natured guy in an underdog story that we've seen a thousand times before.  But I don't see WIlly Wonka.  Maybe this is just a bad trailer for showing off his best moments as Wonka, but I don't see it yet.  Not even in the slightest.  It's like he's in this halfway house between Depp and Wilder, but he's not committing fully to either but he's also not throwing in the same amount of whimsy or eccentricities of them either. It's like he's holding back from going fully into eccentric whimsy and that may work for other characters... but for Wonka turning up both is a necessity. 

The atmosphere and the setting and the music all sounds wonderful.  But for this to work, Wonka **has** to work and I'm not seeing it yet. I hope it does!"
This looks horrible
This is probably the 3rd Reboot  of that story
starting to see a pattern in movie titles nowadays
lmao this is comically miscast
"*Wonka is Johnny Depp*
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
*Timothée Chamalet is Lily-R0se Depp's ex boyfriend*"
"Sad this doesn't have anything from 2005 wonka 🫠 didn't like the original, was excited to see they made a remake w depp & really enjoyed that one !!!!! SMH"
"This movie is Ugly asf 😂, Johnny Depp's role and Movie is 10/10 a Masterpiece period.😎👌🔥"
I REALLY want to see this!!
Why do we need another bloody Wonka film?
Love the trailer for wonka but I find it hilarious that Hugh Grant is a Oompa Loompa that is more fancy
ITS DANIEL THRASHER
Woke
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I must watch this in theaters!
I’m obsessed with him
No ty
Nice trailer
"Here we go, mama"
This guy looks like Daniel Thrasher.
Imagine they show Charlie's grandfather asking for a job in the post credit scene
No original ideas lol
Oompa Loompa doompely doo...
"willy wonka is originally british ""not american"". also this movie looks to not be like the ""Charlie and the chocolate factory movie"" but a ""musical""."
This absolutely ain't it. Can't Warner Bros come up with new original IPs instead of bastardising their back catalogue?
honestly i would like to see in the first movie umpa lumpa
i can't wait <3
حماااسسس
Willy Wokea
Who up willying they wonka?
"""Nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity"""
awsome WB no crazy forcing inclusion and LGTASDASDAZ+++++++ on the movie and focus more in entertaining
Roald Dahl is and always was my homie. The way I ate up his books to escape my own reality
I keep forgetting timothee isn’t 17😭💀
Why do I get Daniel Thrasher vibes
I appreciate that this is a cute origin story and not them trying to remake it or twist it into something dark
I loved the Charlie and the chocolate factory movie when I was a kid now I'm hoping hoe this will turn out.
"This changed my mind, I definitely want to see it now"
His acting is so bad here wth
I wonder if Johnny Deep will wanna see this movie?!
timotheee chalamet is the only person that can play willy Wonka in Wonka the movie
Willy Wonka
"that is simply so coooll! ""Once we've started, we can't stop."" haha gonna love this "
do you yall think this will be promising?
Good
Ryan Renolds Should of played the Part. He's almost got the same voice
academy awards loading
They made Willy wonka culry
REWORK REWORK REMASTER REWORK REWORK ! I HATE HOLLYWOOD
it look like alife
Who up wonking they willy rn?
I feel Jhonny deep is best for willy Wonka
Oh nah💀
"They're doing a new film called ""Wanka"" it's going to be Piers Morgan's life story"
Looking forward to watching it! 😆
OHHHH ITS HIS CHIKDHOOD LMAO
Poor johnny depp i wish he would've been willy wonka again
"Aint no way.
The 4th one?"
From peaches to chocolates.... oh my Elio 😌😌😌
Why does he look like Daniel Thrasher
Its just EW.
I like this. It looks a lot less creepy than the original.
I thought movie stars are supposed to be handsome fellas ...
Lost me at no-day-dreaming. This is not a rated G for all ages. This is a live action fairytale just for kids. No thank you. This is not a worthy prequel.
Wonka is hanging out with a little black girl for what reason now?
Rowen Atkinson 🎉 producer of Harry Potter Timothy 🎉
Man this gives me wonka vibes
can't wait to see it🍫
опять в очередном фильме от голливуда такое количество тёмных ребят w
🍫❤
. chumSour. say caio in bonk.cross^2023
This is hype!
must watch list
is tha...is...t.......th mr.bean?
"Again?! 
This was done twice already"
It better feature MrBeast.
Wheres the sack of you know what Grandpa?
"I don't understand the mockery and hatred about Timothée Chalamet's acting here, Im not a big fan of him but ppl say his a bit overdramatic, and I understand that, but looking back to when adult Willie Wonka from the original film is, he always did act that way, his been weird and unusual but ppl loved him, I know it's such a huge part to fill in an iconic character's role but comparing to the new actor's way of acting rn, his doing alright and i like it, atleast in my opinion."
billions of dollars for another pointless movie in this lost world
La película que más espero del año
I'm so excited 😊
Depp
"Wait, what isn't he a non binary, person of colour with one arm? 


I'm outraged"
Never been less excited for a movie
Its mr bean for me😂
"Director of Padding
Producer of Harry Potter
Hopefully it will be a masterpiece film, and of course very good in terms of acting, cinematography, music, and whatever it is that makes this film good"
NO NO JUST NO. 😢 please just leave the original I get Hailey was a game changer for those who need visuals to help find our identities but Johny didn't need a replacement there is no replacement it's like ur making me ready for a new Captain Jack Sparrow. I ain't signing up😢😢 although blessed are the production team company and talents but no man
This actor is becoming annoying with his real life arrogant and pompous behavior
They cannot come up with new movies so they remake old nonsence ones.
"Yeah, they really didn't need to make another one of these."
Hmm looks fun but I’ll to wait for the ESG rating to come out.
"Oh take my damn money, I’m so sat  🍫"
very nice
I can’t wait!!!🥰💜🎩
Wonka keeps getting younger
seriously aren't people tired of this? Every version has been terrible...and the previous wonkas have been some of my favourite actors.
Is the sorry been reversed by timeline and what we are seeing it is before the Willy wonka factory?
Nope. I won't spend a penny. After Johnny this is what you found? Overrated actor
No
"Yeah the commercial is cool and all, but I’m wondering when lil mabu became an acter."
"“scratch that, reverse it” was my fav part haha aside from Hugh 😂"
Better than mermaid disney
We didn’t need this film nor Timothee
This is unbelievable! I didn't think I will see this in my life. I love this movie so much.
I swear I just saw Mr. bean!
Nobody asked for this nor want it.
Let’s see where this goes 😎
"I feel like its probaly gonna need a name change. Willy Woke-a. Im sure it will b another woke hollywood movie. Seems to b the theme, remake and go woke to push agendas. I will b shocked if its not a woke dumpster fire."
"Not sure about casting him for that, it feels less natural than his other roles"
Random black girl obviously
Did you just say scratch that reverse it 0:18
Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa? Count me in
Timothée Chalamet being upbeat and not brooding or eccentric is trippy.
I can. not wait to go and watch this movie!!!!!
This looks so cool. I can't wait!
1:16 They're not defying the laws of gravity. They're just having fun.
First to reply to this comment is gqy
My favourite part is when he says “It’s Willyin time.” Then proceeds to just get his Willy all over the place. Wild.
Will there will be Grampa Joe as one of the first workers of Willy Wonka?
So proud of Daniel Thrasher finally starring in his own movie. 🥰
CHOCOLATE FACTORY.
Honestly looks like bad writing.
Stop destroying old films and even worse making them woke. What is it with the new wave of woke remakes?
i liked the original oompa loompas better but the rest looks very well portrayed
It looks like garbage 💀
"Jesus is the Way, the Truth, and the Life. Jesus said to Thomas, ""I am the way, the truth, and the life. No one comes to the Father except through Me"". There is only one way to heaven. That Way is Jesus and his word of truth. No other can grant us eternal life."
only reason im seeing the movie is too see mr bean say run away
"1:52 From one mamas boy to another, I love this scene."
This actually looks very good!
it feels weird seeing timothee chalamet here because he does more serious roles. like i cant see him as being wonka i see him as timothee… 😭
Let's take Charlie out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and replace Willy Wonka with the depressed Dune guy.🙄
stormi now has a wonka daddy and billionaire mom 📝📝
There was no need for making this.
"I actually think the over the top body movement fits Wonka as a character, but Chalamet’s line delivery is not it."
WONKA
naaaaah ain't gonna watch it depp will always be my wonka.
"I was very happy with
"" Charlie and the chocolat
   factory "" . . . .                            🍫"
"The movie nobody needed, nor asked for. Sweet."
This is unbelievable! I didn't think I will see this in my life. I love this movie so much.
Different one
"wwoaoaoaoaaat ROwan!! Rowan is there!!??
well i gotta watch this"
I loved this book growing up so excited to see this movie
wan-ker? 😮
why are there so many good films coming out suddenly :P
Just nope
This movie looks horrible tbh
It looks amazing
"I don't understand why everything gets remade. It's like people ran out of ideas. Not only that, books and movies from years back were just so much better."
I think this is gonna be awesome
"Johnny Depp is the best, irreplaceable for these roles❤"
But Johnny depp Willy Wonka was the best
Ink if I’m dreaming or not
MR BEAN🫘
Did I see Rowan Atkinson🧐🧐🧐🧐
Pure cringe. These people are creatively bankrupt. The 1971 adaptation was a master piece in every aspect and will most probably never be outdone.
They should have made Hugh Grant into Willy Wonka
Spoiler alert: his chocolate business is successful.
Nope.
I wonder if black actors ever worry if they got their gig because of their race and not their acting abilities.
@hotdogye
JHONNY DEPP WILLY WONKA>>>>>TIMOTHY WILLY WONKA
ya dejen de arruinar las cosas..donde  o cuando tendran sus propios logros?.. basta de recurrir al pasado para crear cine asqueroso..lo pasado queda en el pasado con sus buenos logros
At First i thought its a Disney Movie
"compared to Johnny Depp, this mediocre actor looks like a homeless man in old rags and with a big top hat (which obviously doesn't suit him)"
terrible
Nice Trailer
"how many time have you watch this 


me: yes"
where is mr.beat?
Wow... it's gonna be an awesome movie...♥️
I am crying.
This is either going to fail hilariously or exceed everyones expectations somehow.
I like this move 😁😁😁
Johnny Depp is the best Willy Wonka ever
i cant wait!! this is going to be too good!!
Mr Bean as a running priest
The Johnny depp version of Willy wonka was A-ok but this is a masterpiece. First he had his father in the depp movie now his mother.
barbenheimer time's up... now its wonkpoleon turn to shine
The chocolate industry is way darker than dark chocolate
Bruh why can't they think of anything original every series legacy gose more in the negative everytime they make a remake or new version
I loved the part where he said (This is going to take crackerjack timing Wonk)
This is the Drake movie
Hugh Great playing an adorable oompa loompa gives me life 😭❤
They really can't make new movies anymore hollywood is a f joke
Who saw the mum form Paddington blowing kisses?
the back ground song of candycrush makes it more nostalgic
Kim Kardashian don’t like wonka
The actor is not good enough
I love the part when he says it's wonking time and wonks all over the place
I like how they're choosing to expand on the Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka.
"yeaah willy wonka, i hope can get a golden ticket to enter his chocolate palace"
Жопка
Ngl I'd easily rate this a 5 star if they at least give a Grandpa Joe cameo since he worked in the factory.
OMG best present for xmas 🥲can`t wait
Just Like OZ the Great And powerful
Looks like fun.
Nice
Looks like its gonna be a great movie and i know that because the plot was explained and broken down in this video
I think this is going to be a perfect Christmas movie 😀✅
"Oh well, it's the 2020s. What am I expecting, good CGI?"
"I see mr. Bean, and thats why im gonna watch it"
those ompalompas don’t look like they’re from lompaland
who's up wonking their willy rn
Best trailer since barbie
I don't know why i felt jhony depp
Still no originality in film
"Doesn't look too bad, can't wait to see it. :)"
Ad mr bean
A much needed Christmas present in 2023🎁 🥹
"Nothing to see here, just a few people defying the laws of gravity.."
OMG! Willy Wonka!❤
Just remind me of johny deep
DISLIKE
So nobody noticed mr bean?
Please let this man do  Edward scissor hands too
Sad that depp's not willy again 😞
This looks both awful and utterly pointless.
The Oompa Loompa is the funniest
A new remake.....No more idea's huh?
"All of Willy Wonka movies
1971: Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 
2005: Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
2017: Tom and Jerry Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 
2023: WONKA"
Super video
he isn't nearly charming enough
"Well, here we go again - can't create a new license with new characters and a original story - lets just vandalize an original and call it better. . ."
Date of release?
"mr. bean as a priest: ""run awayyyyy!!!!"""
I personally prefer the 2004 Willy Wonka
"I love Timothee but the, nOpE sCrAtCh tHat, rEvErsE iT 😭"
Johnny Depp
Nice that this is a prequel and not a cheap version of previous movies...
His dad better be a dentist.
Gas the cast.
"He who controls the chocolate, controls the universe."
Johnney Depps character is the best so far.
For me Wonka should be an other worldly and slightly disconcerting character and I'm just not getting that vibe from this.
Just pure LOVE❤️❤️
Just came here cos I needed a laugh after Oppenheimer
"Another flop from WB. A prequel to Robert Dahl's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory children's novel, seriously? It's written by none other than two guys who have zero previous experience with writing a story, let alone writing a movie. Just stop making these prequel films to other writers work. It's gonna be just like that Ring of Power show where Amazon thought they could make their own prequel to J.R.R. Tolkein's books and hired two writers that also had zero experience with writing a story and television show."
This looks awful! Poor Tim tim
Wonderful the story how Wonka came to be!🙂
:/
No.
Why does it feel and sound like wonkas actor is doing one of those cringe pov character tik tok things this guy isnt fitting at all and also. Why another wonka movie
Quiet listen and down up?
willy wonka now???!
"Oh no, not that guy to play Wonka."
Willy Twinka
Johnny depp was way better
"Another dumb remake film again!  Stop destroy good film and make your original film!  Don’t any companies ever come up with any new original films anymore?  Films are getting remake and remake all over again and again!  This is getting very tiring and pretty bad!  If we don’t get race swapping then we will get feminist films or just totally bad films!  Oh, boy! 😩"
el here we go mama omgg
hughhhh grant as ompa loompa
timothee es un gran actor
me encanto
Willie Woka 😂
NO
I prefer milk chocolate over anything else. Anyone else besdies me?
I've always sorta wondered' about the origins of Willy Wonka and my wish is about to be granted.
1:42 is that Mr.Bean speaking????
mi hijo es fan de estas. peliculas
omaigaddd
"Hahaha i was wondering why it seems like a Harry potter movie 😂
Guess it makes sense the producer is the one from Hp movies."
"O so this is the younger version, like how wonka became wonka. Nice"
He'll yes! A good movie that makes us forget about Disney's lackluster debauchery.
It looks intriguing; can't wait to see it once you pay your actors and writers.
"Ok I do love the original movie and I’m crazy about Wonka, but partly bc he’s so mysterious. Idk if I want an origin story"
Wanted Johny depp as wonka 😢❤ he would've nailed it
More Dwarfs losing a job.
Yeah… ill pass this one
"It's SO great seeing Timothée playing these kind of character, so different of what we usually see him interpret 👏👏 I'm excited for this, it looks cute and heartwarming ❤"
More woke nonsense.
Can’t wait for Wonka to start cooking blue rock crystals candy
The is amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!😃😃😃😃😃😄😄😄😁😁😁
Again a woke movie. Unnecessary shoving black characters.
Wow Willy is actually still a male - those MAGA fundamentalists at Warner
I'm still trying to figure out whether charlie is a grown man or not? And Wich movie or they basing this one off  of ? . . .❤😂🎉😮😊
timothee rn being the best actor of our generation i love him so much
tomo holland never could
timothee is such a versatile actor i love him
Half the cast is off Peep Show lol
todos vamos a verka mi novio
que hermoso que buena actuacion
t amo tim
me enamora timothee
JD better
"The Kwisatz Haderach opens a candy store. Yeah, I can see that."
Should have been Charls Carroll
Why has nobody made a movie about Charlie being in control of the chocolate factory
i liked how they put black people in fitting roles not pushed the black people down our throats
Nope
This looks promising
hes too pixie dream girl and not enough manic
Idk bout this.
Nick eh 15 should be a oompa loopa
Nope. So much nope. All the nope.
I actually unironically adore the trailer for wonka.
"Well, I can only think of one word to use for this...
Scrumdiddlyumptious!"
He's missing the Johnny Depp character I got used to...good for him getting the role though....
Pathetic
This is a movie I will be taking my son to and I’m excited that it’s a different retelling because I don’t know how many more remakes I can handle mentally 😂
No
charlie and the chocolate factory is my all.time.favorite book and movie...I hope they don't ruin it
Isn’t it kind of ironic that Lilly-Rose Depp’s father and ex-boyfriend both played Willy Wonka?
I was bout to say WHERE THE UMPA LUMPAS!! This movie is really gonna bring about 4 generations together!!
i cannot WAIT for this
"His acting sounds so forced and fake.
I'm sorry, I just don't get the appeal of Timothee Chalamet as a character actor."
Lil mabu changed careers
Willy Wonka
Nice movie
Nooooo why Another  remake 😢
HORRIBLE HISTORIES!!
Looks like ds
Wait I’m so confused how will this tie into the fact he was raised by a dentist then ran off to the chocolate factory 😭😭😭😭
"""Nothing to see here, just a group of people defying the laws of gravity."""
"Looks trash 🗑️👎🏼 but who knows, it just might be a good movie 🤷🏻‍♂️ hugh grant playing an oompa loompa is not a good idea though."
Completely charmless. Idiots making trash films for simpletons.
This looks exCEEDINGLY dumb..
"Better show how he became such a gloomy man as well. The original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had a very sad and lonesome Willy. We should know why.

Also, don't so a remake of The Neverending Story."
"wow I hate the race-forced characters.. switch them up to fit naturally with the roles and it would be fine, but force specific roles to fit the race-rule seems off... looks like a good movie ignoring that tho."
"Ah the singing dancing happy go lucky white savior wonka movie about workers rights, exactly how its always been😒"
super duper excited about the movie ...but why is it not JOHNNY DEPP ???I was expecting him at the end atleast!!
F mr bean!
I’ve never laughed at a movie trailer.. Hugh grant as the oompa loompa made me chuckle.. definitely seeing this movie
Na he can't act I could do better
My childhood has returned
Cringe 😬 try hard lol😅 shows how great of an actor Johnny is.
Well that was stupid
I love Timothy Chalamet but he looks more like Charlie than Willy Wonka
So this is actually supposed to be like the beginning of Willy Wonka I think they should say the beginning of Willy Wonka I think a lot of people getting confused it's that beginning to start
bro his backstory already was explained
"My first thought, AGAIN???  But, after seeing the trailer....😊.  It's a Willy in the beginning.  Interesting."
"I'm just happy they've brought back the original Oompa Loompa song. Although Hugh Grant looks great, I wish they would have hired Dwarf actor's like the original. They need jobs too."
Willy Wokena 👎
wow... so no one saw Mr. Bean?
Sign The Contract To Go See This Movie On Christmas In IMAX
So where is Charlie?
Prophet Mohammad does not approve.
Chalamet isn't quietly nuts enough for this. Should've been Daniel Radcliffe.
TOM Holland could have been Wonka too.
Odd that Wonka is not black...
An Oompa what now- 😭
OMGGG 😢😢😢 can't waitt
No blacks in my Wonka
Hopefully this will do good
Not timotee chalame he sounds weird
i would've loved to see someone like matt smith take up the role of wonka but i'm def gonna watch this
"I must say, I liked Johnny Depp better as a Willy Wonka character!"
"Wonka beats the baron's by creating a monopoly.

Very creative"
I CANT FREAKIN WAIT 🤗🤗🤗
Goshhh I'm soo excited 😭
Harry Potter vibes
I thought Wonka was supposed to be awkward?
"Chocolates, chocolates nd chocolates"
He looks like Daniel Thrasher
1:25 Karl?
Another trash remake nice thanks for that
At least the Oompa Loompa looks less scarier than in the Willy Wonka from the 1920’s
BUTLERMAN!
Looks like dogshit
"Ngl i love that line ""every good thing in this world started with a dream so hold on to yours"""
Afuckinotherone
oh no.....timmy is not crazy enough for this character....nope....the trailer is already so bad
when i seen rowan atkinson in it i was hooked
Why?
ollie😓
Woke garbage
Johnny Depp was the best. No matter how hard you try you cant erase him.

"When I look up Snowpiercer, this trailer is one of the first results."
Willy Woker
Well this is just rehashed Hollywood shite
Don’t get why people are hating on this it looks good
Johnny Depp is my favorite
Dune part 2 looks crazy
here comes another bomb
ROWAN ATTKINSOONNNN 🤗🤗
"The problem with this movie is that its made by the production company that made the harry potter films. So this film has a harry potter vibe with all the ""magic"" and thats the flaw, they are so obsessed with harry potter that they put the harry potter influence in all their films now"
Can we just not and say we did?
Love it dude
What? A white male as Willy Wonka? That’s an unexpected relief
A wonka that is not Johnny Depp uuuf
Ha Ha Ha  black actors again
nice movie
Bro this is gonna be one of those good origin movies
"Imagine when we were getting actual good movies before, now it's just sequels, remakes, reboots, offspins..."
My bad I can't imagine  anyone as willy wonka expect Jonny Depp.
Can’t wait for December 15 🔥🔥
"1:42 
Mr. Bean ??!"
"I love it how 5 minutes ago we had a WW&TCF remake, and now we get another one. And CGI Oompa Loompas"
Who cares
"They have ruined it, I cant
I cant anymore
They haven't done the originals justice at all."
"My prediction for the opening titles 


Warner Bros. Pictures 
Presents 


In Association With 
Village Roadshow Pictures 


A
Roald Dahl/ Heyday Films
Production 




Wonka 







Idk if it’s the actual opening credits"
Not creepy enough.
Period drama + Childhood character = Happy days
This movie is incomplete without Wonka's dentist dad 😁
"Willy Woke-na? No thanks👎 Here, have some chocolate💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩💩"
"So they brought Tim Burton's Batman.
Now his Willy Wonka.
What next?
His Beetlejuice?"
i have a bad feeling about this!!!
🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Cringe af 🤡🤡🤡
was that mr bean at 1:42
"From the moment I see "" From the producer of Harry Potter"" I saw Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw and Slytherin❤❤❤❤"
so much Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts vibes.
i saw Rowan Atkinson
Johnny Depp >>>>>
The Hugh Grant oompa loompa will feature in my nightmares
Utter Bs
I can't get out from johnny depp wonka image forever
"wow hopefully this movie is good dont want little timmy messing the most iconic character up now do we.....

anyway all jokes aside im glad they used references from the original movie
🙂"
"Well, I haven’t read the books or saw the first adaptation of it, I want to say I feel a tad skeptical about this one… I think I will try to consider this movie as a separate work from all the adaptations and the book, but… I don’t know there is something that doesn’t quiet sit right with me"
Nobody's gonna replace Depp. He's the man always 🤩🤩

NOW THERE'S A WONKA TRILOGY!
WHY??? WHY ARE THERE SO MANY MOVIES COMING OUT THIS YEAR??????
"Everything is good except the fact that they use chalamet face as willy wonka, I don't know it's just my preference by the way 😉 (ps. no hate for timothee, i love him)"
I‘ rather more interested in a prequel
Yo is that rowan atkinson 1:02
I don’t know how to feel.
BOMB
When is the premiere  night showing here in Philippines ?
May god have mercy on your doomed souls you pack of money grabbing cabbages. 0/10
Isn't Wonka based on that British child molester celebrity?
This movie is very good and will definitely win the oscar.🔥⭐️
Mr bean❤❤❤
Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over. Thank you Roald Dahl.
Yes we back it again!!!!
Reminds me of Treasure- VolKno... I'mma willy wonka!
Bro let’s be honest… Wonka is Johnny Depp… it’s childhood and I can’t take any other actor on this role
Incredible that majority of the positive comments have random numbers after their usernames...
TIMMMYYYY
"TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET

Why?
The……3rd one :D
I am anti-umpa lumpa guyz
This is dis is gonna be legit lit lmak hqha😂😅
"Um, the Hugh Grant thing stronger than the spectacle. Promising. Chalamet? Wishing the best."
Is this a prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory?
Has potential... but based on this it is a NO GO NO SEE from me.
WB trying to outwoke Disney is hilarious.
yooo I cant wait
"This feels like more pretentious new world order woke garbage I won't spend money to see. It could have been good had they left it the journey of Wonka,  but it's ""diversity first and story must comply with wokeness""... Sigh"
"Nothing will ever beat the original, I’m sorry…"
I never thought we'd get a prequel of this character.
"I love Hugh Grant, but not using an actual little person actor for an Oompa Loompa is disappointing. Peter Dinklage would have been amazing."
Surprised they didn’t hire a black actor to play Wonka… 🫢
I smell Woke😂
Finally a new idea... even if it has our classic characters ❤ in it
"The original Willy Wonka movie is legendary.
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was pure garbage.
This one looks promising actually"
Team 1971 and 2005
"This looks awful, doesn't make any sense."
its like pissing up
If we get to see where the ompaloomoas and the wangdoodles were from that’d he cool
Im so going to the movies 🍿
Looks so bad
Timotee chalamat is just the best person to play Willy Wonka
My eyes are puking. This is the worst looking movie I have ever seen. The actor is wrong for wonka and this feels like they are just making fun of the movie rather than it being a movie. This movie should not exist!!!
Who up willying their wonkas rn 🥵
Sure Hope 2005 Wonka Sees This
Ok so it's a prequel to Willy Wonka and how he got started.  Not a remake of Gene Wilders Willy Wonka.
WE'RE GETTING A THIRD WILLY WONKA MOVIE??
I'm out
"Seems like an interesting story, but I wish it didn’t go against the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, especially with the Oompa Loompas. Also, the acting and written dialogue I already can tell is laughable! Hard pass."
the story is so contrived at this point that is loses any meaning.
a film that does not need to exist
"Nothing beats the classic oompa loompas, no need for cgi"
A family vibe
I knew Wonka liked himself some chocolate but never like this 😏
There is only one Johnny Depp...
Token blacks in the movie.......more  box ticking
Brilliant
absolutely not
"This looks awful, Wonka doesn’t need an origin story."
So this is how Wonka became the famous candyman
who be wlling they wonka for this movie
1:41 in case you missed the Legend Mr.Bean.
“Wonka” 💀
It looks so good!
Y he and  where is Johnny Depp
Why they swapped the boy with a black girl???
"Remember when Willy Wonka lead the rebellion against the Juarez cartel and put cocaine in his chocolate? 
This movie looks wack"
😅Mr bean 1:03 he was there😂
Take james frank as Oompa Loompa 😂😂😂
Looks awful 😢
Looks like the most boring movie ever made but I will still watch it.
Willy wonka is back!
"Black Annie in Wonka Loompa?
Me thinks not!
Finally happened.Now they will give us Willie Woke nobody asked for.
The nerve of Woke people."
Hmmmmmmm.  This trailer did not inspire me to want to watch this movie.  I have been looking forward to seeing it until I watched this.  The only thing I liked about it and made me laugh was Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa.
yeah... what happend to the psychopath wonka?
is that uniform french or german? i dont think its british
He shoulda been cast Charlie lol not Willy lol
i think he could be more deranged
Johnny depp is best Wonka
Suprised they didnt cast a black dude as wonka.
Are the token diversity hire blacks the only non-white race they could find even though they represent less than several other races in terms of population as opposed to race bait funded activism?
"If Rowan Atkinson is in the movie, then it would be a blockbuster! 😎"
Rowan atkinson and hugh grant is all we need !!! 🤣 I’m excited !
Is this a musical? Mehhhh
This is so mid it’s funny
Oh God. Where is Johnny Depp
Wow reboot
0:19 Goofy ahh answer
Lets have Dune Wonka crossover
"again? oh god, help hollywood"
I but u Wonka will get kidnapped and the girl will have to safe him girl.power
Hopefully this'll be better than that GOD AWFUL Tom & Jerry crossover from 2017.
total tripe.
Giant Cringe Fest
Just noticed Rowan Atkinson is innit
willy wakanda
"No one asked for this to be remade again… 

What are these people doing in Hollywood.. get some new material"
1:34 that hat looks similar to Indy’s
"full of blacks.. in a white world
no thanks"
Justin Trudeau acted well in this trailer. 😅
"Call upon Jesus and place your faith in him, he loves you.  Looks like a good movie btw"
Wawwww
jonnnnyyyyyyyy<<333333
Disappointed they didnt make willy wonka black smh
Oh no
I’m so excited for this move!!
wai..... wait huh what?Its Mr bean?1:02
I laughed so hard at the end of oompa loompa's dance. Definitely gonna watch it!!!
"hahahaha i was thinking about another remake but looks like something new, i like the idea"
"This looks like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Wonka hahahaha.  Trailer didn't sell me at all."
"Hmm I dunno about this one. What I loved about Wonka in charlie and the chocolate factory is his mysterious nature and his odd personality. Putting all of his back story out there just make his character lose the very thing that got me attached to the character. It's not a bad concept but it's just not for me. Honestly, the entire trend of Hollywood going anti-mystery and trying to explain and give a backstory for everything leaving nothing for the imagination is not to my taste at all. But hey, maybe I'm just too old for the current hollywood."
Timothy is the only kid actor that gives me goosebumps
Bon ça n'a pas l'air si mal
Жопка)
Really excited to watch Timothee Chalamet again 😍
o-o idk wonka doesnt seem crazy enough wasnt the onset and depiction of willy wonka to be beyond common sense.. he doesnt act that way
Can’t compete with Johnny depp
This is even much better that the matilda renake
Still remember Johnny depp Willy Wonka ❤❤❤
You'd have to be a total wonka to watch this
This kid can't act to save his life
Dunepaloompa 😂. Looks good though. Look forward to see what this Actor does after this too!
So this is a movie about LSD
I knew I saw mr bean 🫘 somewhere
Ok wanka is back
"""from the director of Paddington and Harry Potter starring Timothee Chalamet"" - we all already know it's gonna be good."
жопка
Would have preferred Tim Burton to make this but I’m excited nonetheless
Funny to still see the michael jackson influence.
Please f***ing stop. Thank goodness Hollywood is on strike or whatever.
Ah finally the prequel to Snowpiercer 😂
This was the gene wilder verison not the johnny deep version
Is this movie for adults or children? Like who are the target audience
Another movie I’ll be skipping sadly ..
Whoooo I'm glad this isn't another ariel
SMH what a waste of Timothy and a legendary movie ... oh well.
"This could not have missed the point of the original story any more than it has.
And sadly, idiots will eat it up. Roald Dahl would vomit if he saw this."
Looks cute!
Johnny depp is best ❤️❤️❤️
Old is gold Johnny depp  is best ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
""
Would of been great if they got Johnny Depp again not this kid
Must watch
Can we not have a reboot please. Noone wants to see another one. Just make new ideas
Why is this feeling underwheling
yeah... no thanks..
mi rey te amo timothee
mo hay otro como timothe
this movie will be one of the most heart touching movie ever.
eres el amor de mi vida timothee
timmi soñe contigo anoche
"te a,oooooo"
timmy precioso
t amo mi timmy bello
i think i saw mr bean lol
Mr bean. yay!
"I’m sorry but this IS EPIC AF FOR actually, for all the right reasons!! Reply if you’re hyped af as well!!"
"Can we just leave things as they were? Why do we ruin everything, who even asked for this?"
Timothée Chalamet ruins the character of Willy Wonka. It doesn't seem right to me
"Some things are so good that you don't want to try anything else, you don't want to speculate ""What if"" scenarios. Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka is that thing. Depp is so iconic that I wish nobody ever tried to speculate what if some other guy plays Willy Wonka."
"What the actual f*ck, Hollywood has run out of ideas completely it's embarrassing, gene wilder will always be no. 1 how do you top gene.... Johnny Depp fair play.... This s"
"Ok? But I feel like there are to many whites in this movie? Why not cast a Latinx or African American in wonkas role? I feel like we are taking one step forward and 2 steps back, maybe learn from Disney Warner bros…"
"It seems to me a very nice trailer, about a film that promises to talk about a boy who makes his dream come true. It seemed to me that Chalamet took the role very seriously, and in general all the cast and production theme seemed to have enjoyed making the project."
MATHEW BAYNTON??????
MATTHEW BAYNTON IN A BIG MOVIE LIKE THIS IS CRAZY HE DESERVES IT YEAAAAAAAAAH
Mr Bean with choco
"My family has a tradition of going to a movie after opening gifts and breakfast on Christmas Day, and this looks perfect to carry that on"
"they follow the Tim Burtons theme that the hoompa loompas are singing and dancing but idk the the timeline, Willy get out to his father i think he is 9yr old i guess but the era is already modern, but here Willy is already teenager but his era is victorian"
ну хоть рэпа нет в трейлере
Me wondering who the girl is in a movie that's supposed to be about WIlly Wonka...
MR BEAAAAAN IS HEREEEE
Nothing beats the 1971 orginal
NO one can replace the  place of jhony deep legend always legend
This doesn’t sound like Wonka. It looks like someone else put on a Wonka costume.
Hope you the best in life you are a great acter and a awesome and great person ❤❤❤
Chalamet isn't working for me as Wonka. He just sounds too sane 😅😆
Did anybody ask for this movie?
Gonna be Barbenwonka
Is that Mr BEAN? 1:41😮
I wanna see this!🍫🍫
"Love the ending, when he says ""the true wonka were the friends we made along the way"""
0:30 no wonder wonka's chocolate tastes so good
This has to be Charlie when he grew up??? Omggg❤❤❤❤🎉🎉
💀💀💀goofy movie
Looks awesome!!! Thankful they have the original style oompa loompas!!!! Cant wait for this to come out!!!! Im so there!
At least I'm not in the no daydreaming place id have to pay 2920$ a year
💯
why is he the lead
"Me when dune timothy guy who are about to portrayed young Wonka version- Warner:-  💸💰 shut up and take my money,we need young and smarty pants version of young wonka"
cringe fest it looks so bad
My favourite part of this was when Willy Wonka said it’s Wonking time and Wonked all over the screen
to many good actors to be true...im excited
Is this the story on how the kid from the original willy wonka movie turned the chocolate factory into a bigger and better one?
Looks great!
Didn't see this coming! Should be good
So... He is the young wonka
"I movie looks very cute, can’t wait! I love that this trailer has a Monty Python reference followed directly by an Up reference! 😆"
1:40 Yo it's mr. bean
I’m sorry but. NO ONE WILL REPLACE mr. Depp.
It’s another white savior movie?
This looks terrible
Naaaaaahhhhhhh
This trailer gave me diabetes.
Is looks harry potter universe
"Well.. I never saw the Paddington movies, but it's clear Paul King has moved past his Mighty Boosh / Bunny and the Bull phase"
Again?
Where's. Veruca Salts?
More small people out a job 😂😅😂.
this looks so generic and formulated
mr wanka
I'm honestly excited for this
Was that Mr. Beaaaan?
They also have mr bean as the lift operater
He looks like Jack Wolfe😭
She looks as out of place as if she were Mexican.
From cannibalism to chocolate nice 👍
Hope it flops
"*Wait a minute, did i just saw Mr.Bean?🤣*"
i frickin love timothee chalamet
no
Mr bean?!!
why timmy look like lil mabu
What happened to his father? That was  a main character in his life .
This is gonna bomb so hard
"So because this is a movie for children, it has to be bad? Pathetic."
We need a willy wonka horror film
This actually looks like fun!
Dey done made slugworth black
why not cast a real dwarf? Oh hollywood....
I dont like timothy chalamet in this role he doesnt fit it correctly.
Uhhh this movie needs Pure Imagination! Hope they got the Song xd
You couldn't find a real dwarf to play a frickin' Oompa Loompa? 🤡
This whole movie looks like a mr beast challenge
Cringe
"Everyone: ""Johnny Depp was the worst Willy Wonka! He was too creepy!""

Me who actually read the book: (insert Thor Ragnarok meme) ""Was he, though?"""
"God is a hairy humanoid soaking in a bathtub, floating alone in a bubble of absolute and eternal solipsism, imagining a world around itself in all directions."
Actually looks like a good prequel😮
Wonka first in 1960s 2005 Tom and Jerry and now 2023
"Wonka just always made magic candies? I've only seen the movies... but. those presented the magical candies as experimental and strange, not something Wonka had been doing for years already that the public had seen and consumed already."
We have to wait till Christmas???
"OMG, yes!! ❤"
Tbf it’d cool in 10 when he ages up a bit go Charlie and chocolate factory and glass elevator this style
Not him trying to be quirky
This is gonna be soo good when it releases get this too 1k likes
I get the feeling there's gonna be more dark chocolate in this movie...
🤦‍♂️ just no
"This COULD be a decent movie since it's not a total rewriting of the original story. The black girl however is a new element, if they keep with the original were Wonka is alone in his factory it could imply that she will eventually leave him (or something bad will happen)"
"dang, never thought wonka was not being played by depp on this"
"Why does this look worse visually than ""Charlie and the chocolate factory"" a movie that came out lamost twenty years ago. Why are all the colours so muted in a fantasyland movie for children? PS: I like Pope Mister Bean."
I can’t wait
You cannot beat the original with Gene wilder . Even the Johnny Depp version is better than this ! Leave it alone and stop trying to remake a remake .
Timothy Chalamet has undeniable range. Just watched the trailer for Dune 2 - feels like two totally different actors.
This looks amazing! I already loved the other ones and I love Timothy Chalamets acting in dune!
they should stop putty yoda in chargd of movie orders😂
"i heard the reason this was so expensive to make is cos the camera equipment and rigging and lighting is actually made of chocolate! hollywood is really impressive now, i wish they would have more movies made of candy :o)"
MARK LUCAS
IS THAT MR BEAN IM GOING TO WET MYSELF
Nobody beats jonny depp he will always be the best willy wonka period.
This might actually be good.
0:08 that might be the worst line i ever heard in a movie
I prefer the Mr. Beast version
"Wow, this looks… really bad, in all honesty. This trailer just confirmed my first reaction to the news of it"
I love Hugh grant so much lol
"See, children? This is how garbage is made."
1:02 yo is that mr bean???
Needed Johnny depp !
"AGAIN?  How many of this and Superman, Spiderman, Batman, etc. etc. etc. versions must we endure? Can Hollywood ever be original again?? Thank God for Angel Studios for bringing us different and engaging movies."
I’m getting a lotta Cruella (2021) vibes right now.
Excellent casting. CGI physics is Meh. Hopefully your writing and editing budget was sufficient.
Terrible
why
Ok now I really want to see this 😊
Why this has the same energy as the cats movie
"Rowan Atnikson is here too, sick!!"
"The only wonka I’ll watch other than Johnny deep is timothee so, yay"
I hope this one doesn't have as much body horror as the one with Johnny Depp 😭
Tbh this looks better then the last two Charlie and the chocolate factory movies combined
Well like the Willy Wonka himself said.. idk about this one lol
Johnny depp's version of willy wonka>>>
😳😳😳😊😊😊
timotheee slayed
Europa The Last Battle is better!!
Very nice video
"I grew up watching the old ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" back in the 90s, saw the Johnny Depp ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" as a teenager, I'm 33 now and looking forward to this."
I'm excited 😊  waiting for it❤🎉😊
« Willy wonka was a child murderer »
His eccentricity sounds too fake
"i hope i really like it, i just can’t get jhonny depps version out my head."
"Lost me the second they had to quote Jean Wilder. Movie has no legs to stand on. Want to watch a good wily wonka movie, go see the original."
Olivia Colman? Rowan Atkinson? Hugh Grant? All with Timothee Chalamet?? THIS MOVIE WOULD BE ON FIRE!!! 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"At first I thought they're making another Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie? But now since I have watched the full previews, it doesn't look so bad. 
And I am looking forward to seeing Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa."
Plenty of blacks in this farce of a movie
Of course he has a chocolate woman
"There is only one Willy Wanka ""Johnny Deep""!!!"
Absolutely awful
"They have to stop rehashing movies and you ingrates have to stop watching them. Please create original content! Please no more nostalgia or super heroes, please for the love of god!"
"If Gene Wilder was still alive, he’d love this."
"“Making chocolate of course, how do you like it? Milky, light, dark, NUTTY” 💀💀💀"
You either willy yo wonka or you wonka yo willy
trash
I don't want your future😢🎉
Mr beann?
"AKA trying to push a young actor even if he is not fit fort he role THE MOVIE, coming soon to empty theatres near you"
Ouch..
I'm not getting any Gene Wilder vibes at all.
How many times can Hollywood remake this movie?
No one can replace Johnny Depp
i almost cant belive Netflix isnt behind this cringe fest
I like how there using the original ompa lompa style
Willy Woke-a might not be well received this time around
"Wow, I'll watch it just to see Rowan Atkinson"
I had low expectations. But this just looks and feels so DELIGHTFUL ❤
i loved j.depp mahn dat man made me love nd hate tht character at the same time.
I think johny dep will act as wonka but he isnt....
1:03 It's ROWAN ATKINSON!!!!
"I  those years there was not black people in Europe.  They want to force multiculturalism in Europe. As you can see,when you travel to Paris or London is so disgusting.  They have destroyed Europe."
"Johnson, Alan Johnson"
"You know w hat? Looks fun, let us wait and see"
Is that Mr. Bean? 1:41
My sweet tea~~~~~~~~~~~~ I cant wait to seeya
Johnny depp is the Willy Wonka no one can beat him... No hate for Timothee
There are tow actors that i want to see so im giving it a chance
I must see this.. that harry potter magic vibe really kicks in
This looks so bad
Gene Wilder (God rest his soul) will always be the best and only Willy Wonka!
"So ""WILLY' has an unrelated CHOCOLATE little girl now? I guess it's true that Hollywood is full of pedophiles. But at least this one is has a diverse cast that Timmy can stick chocolate roll into."
Ouch!!!
WOOOOOOO
This looks awful. Timothy can not lead a film.
Wonka like Alice in wonderland
i love the diversity in this but could of included more different colours of people
That girl...
Original movie reboot.
NO ONE REALLY SAW MR BEAN BRUH
"Finally, Жопка trailer"
hmm
I saw Mr bean so I watch it
Who wonkin up their willy while watching this?
"They going back my childhood days at year ,2000 starring johnny depp"
I used to think Timothee Chalamet had no talent but I was wrong. It takes a specific skill to make Willy Wonka the most boring character in the movie
Hidung sama
Johnny Depp will always be my Willy Wonka
"So this must be the origin story of Willy Wonka, and I love it! :D"
The best Wonka is Johnny Depp. Excited to see how Timothy plays him. Fun fact he's dated Depp's daughter
Oh my goshh
Mr. Bean???😂
It's like a young Johnny Depp Willy Wonka's own movie 🍿🍫🍬🍭
wonka just johny depp
жопка
Wooowhhhh😮 very wonderfull
Was that Charlie’s mum from the jhonny depp one
The fact that Rowan Atkinson is also casting this amazing show❤ Goosebumps 😭😭😭
I was expecting johnny depp😢
Gotta be deleting the negative comments
Timothee doesn’t look right in this part.
not enough Asian and middle eastern representation.
"Origin story of Willy Wonka? 

I didn't know if I actually needed that."
My childhood has returned!
"This looks likes Peter Pan + Willy Wonka. I like the old movies, so i’m not sure if i will like this movie. But I will keep my hopes up. 👍"
0:05-0:14
This is the dumbest thing I've seen in a while
Is it just me or the guy @1:41 looks like Rowan Atkinson lol
Mr bean???❤❤
"i loved the part where willy said “it’s wonking time, let’s save the world from all non swiss chocolates” truly one of the one-liners in history"
💗
timmy t amo
You’re telling me that Timothee Chalemet is playing Willie Wonka? 😭😭😭😭
...and theyre on strike
🤢
Am so up for Chalamet as Willy Wonka
"""Scratch that, reverse it."" should be taken out that's Gene Wilder's line as Wonka and that's the only Wonka that matters. I was a kid 50 years ago so there..."
"When he said ""strike that, reverse it"" i shuddered. Don't try to be Gene Wilder, be your own Wonka"
0:11 OMG
Gene Wilder would have loved this.
Bruh
Missing jhonny depp!!
1:17 key and peele.. just key
Alan Johnson left JLB and made it to the movies - stick that up your dojo
I bet it's CREEPY!
It's the same but now there is a more diverse group of kids. As if the USA in reality suddenly had a more diverse population lol
"this is excellent, but i got scared of oompa loompa, even if its hugh grant"
❤
Thank you not just making another woke remake. This actually looks good!
why are there zero negative or critical comments? it seems everyone thinks this is amazing already and I'm barely interested after watching the trailer
Passing on this Woke trash.  There is no franchise the woke writers won't ruin.
This could be good
this is the most DEADPAN Wonka I've ever seen hahahaha
Fingers crossed this is good
Was that MR MOSBEY ? 1:07
Bruh Hollywood really running out of ideas.
It feels like a Disney production. It's got a lot of diversity in it.
Idk about the acting of the kid playing Willy but I'll eventually watch it
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRASH AND AN INSULT THE ORIGINAL.
"I totally want to use that Hugh Grant line on my boss, ""too late, I've started dancing now and once we've started we can't stop"". Bah ha ha ha  I will edit this comment and let everyone know if I get fired AND arrested. LOL"
YOOO THIS LOOKS EPIC!!!
timothee chalamet was BORN for this role! for some reason i thought he was willy wonka in another movie of charlie in the chocolate factory but like in the way that ive just already seen him as willy wonka but i havent seen the movie. yknow?
He reminds me of the Artful Dodger.
NANIIIIII
Noooooo
Oh my god this looks so freaking amazing I am not a fan of the movie but this is making super excited!!
Cringe
i dont understand but old is always gold 🤔
"As much as people liked Gene Hilder, I feel like there’s potential to make this into a really good trilogy. Start here with Wonka, then Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a sequel, then a movie about the factory after Charlie took over to close it off."
A movie about child molester pedophilia... Should have cast Michael Jackson...oh yeah dead
"Timothee as Willy Wonka is something I never imagined, but it's a nice change of pace."
What a wonka 😂
"I cannot expressed the level of FRICKEN HYPED I AM FOR THIS 
😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆😆🥰🥹"
Is that the dude who always memes on the piano? Yoooo
"I'm not sure that Timothee Chalamet is best for this role. He' almost too introverted, his movements aren't eccentric enough, and his voice lacks inflection, wonder, and excitement. I think the music could also be better, but I can't put a pin on it."
Not timotheee chalemeeetr
"It looks good, but we don't need another Willy Wonka. We certainly didn't need the dreadful version with Johnny Depp. Willie Wonka is Gene Wilder and always will be!"
Stop.
"I spy with my little eye someone whom we all love............










MR. BEAN 😃😃😃😃

Tho.........





Why is
Rowan Atkinson a priest now 😅😂?




“RUN AWAY!!!!!” 🤣"
cuteness overload!!
Made by committee film. No thanks.
"I think Tomothe is not a good fit for this movie. He looks too cute for that. 
Willie I think is more misterious ,funny and serious at the same time with a lot of imagination. Anyway I will watch it."
Of course there's a black girl
Nothing original anymore
I'm going to watch this trailer a lot.
Um tthe last one before this si way better this is ewww
We need the Coraline movie from the story 😢 that would be a box office
Paul muad'dib in his coma
YEAH NO he is no Wonka he can't even sound convincing .... his acting is really poor for this role.
You can’t tell me that Wonka was a muggle. He was totally a wizard. Where are my HP fans?
SO EXCITED
Hmm.
Another woke movie.
Aku akan menunggu...  WOOOONNNKKKAAAA....  Layan makan coklat! 🍫
I trust the creators but I’m still not convinced on Timotee Chalamet as Willy Wonka.
Cmoooon not this punk!
Bahaha WarnerBros paying for the boosts and the likes because you know this looks like utter garbage
Wrong actor to play Willy he should be English not American
Am I the only one that finds it odd that there is not one bad comment? Allow me: the movie looks woke and I will not be seeing it.
These remakes just get worse and worse
Hugh Grant will be the best part of this movie. I'm not feeling Chalamet as Wonka though.
This is definitely the prequel to the Gene Wilder version.
this could have been charlie day
"I love that moment in the trailer where Willy became Wonka and said ""It's wonking time""."
So what's next? A remake of gone with the Wind? A Hondo remake? A Wild Bunch remake?
Naahhh
Looks absolutely atrocious
Why does he sound like Foghorn Leghorn.. 0:19
Omg Keygan as the sarcastic cop was hilarious to see.
⚡️slay⚡️
2023 movies are going to be so fun and iconic it’s giving “ the world is healing again but in a better way” nostalgia in a modern way.
I wish Tim Burten would make a Willy Wonka like story about EL CHAPO .
Jesus....let the 1rst movie in PEACE omg ..go do something DIFFERENT
"Another Wonka movie.  That is enough, on that topic.  That is one creepy actor.   No thanks."
did anyone spot the character who was just inserted for no real good reason & serves nothing to telling the story of wonka from the original
"I'm going to skip it.  Been there, done that."
trash i preffer johnny deep one
Can we please stop doing remakes of Charlie and the chocolate factory?? The first movie was perfect we didn't need any more.
Y did they switch the actor??
"Barbie, oppenheimer, napoleon, now this… cinema is being saved"
😂too many black people
Does this mean they're finally gonna bring back the real life Wonka Bars?!!!!!
Not enough black people 😡
Жопка
Looks weird nothing like the original
Not sold on wonka
Meh
This is so good Timothee is so versatile and that Oompa Loompa to be Hugh Grants is so cute 😍 I can’t wait to see this!
noooooo☹️ wheres the ungrateful kidss
Wow…. This looks so… meh.
Quote from a tumblr post about wonka: “where is the madness behind his eyes??? The malice??? The complete disregard for the laws of mankind and decency??? This man makes me fear that I’ll be shoved into a taffy machine at the slightest provocation”
"no raceswapping, no woke things. what a perfect movie!"
EPIC THIS FIRE
"Awesome, loved it. Can't wait."
he would make a perfect hobbit)
"they literally butchered the saying at 0:11 it’s *strike* that, reverse it…"
Why? Hasn't this movie been done to death?????
I will not be watching the new woke PC travesty of one of my favorite stories ever. It looks horrendous. No
"Looks pretty garbage. Not much of a surprise, though."
i can’t take this kid playing wonka seriously he’s like 13
Rowan Atkinson saying RUN AWAYYY got me 😂
Sorry but Johnny depp is irreplaceable 😢
Haha...another 1?
im very happy there is rowan atkinson in the movie i just miss him
I thought it would be cringe but it looks kinda fun
I have some doubts but I am excited all the same.
Hollywood has wonked it’s last Willy
I see Rowan Atkinson. That's enough for me. I will watch this!
CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS ON BIOSKOP ASAP!
no Soul
why
Well was terrible
Great no remake. Would watch
Nice Ollaah ❤🎉🇲🇦
Damn they even have michael keagan as a police
They'll NEVER EVER EVER SURPASS GENE WILDER. The 1 and only WONKA.
"I'm always surprised how WB burns their money and just don't care about it, total insanity."
"This movie is going to be worse than the other Wonka's. Just worse, bad and another money grab. 0/10, not going to watch"
another one?
I've been waiting for this film since it was announced Timothy challamate looks just like willy Wonka 😮
"Quentin Tarentino was right, we live in an era of creativity bankruptcy. There is no exciting movie anymore, all they do is recycling old ideas or réadaptons old movies that don’t need to"
mr. bean!
Cringe
It's very stupid
"Judging by the design of the Oompa Loompa, I'd guess this movie is supposed to be in the same universe as the 1970s movie? Or maybe it's just a nod. Chalamet don't come close to having the same mysterious charisma as Gene Wilder though."
How dumb...he does not make a good Willy Wonka!
oh god they could’ve picked a worst actor.
R u fkn kidding me..... don't ruin my memory of Johnny depp willy wonka
Wesley wizard wheezes?
"""The producers of HARRY POTTER""???"
The MATRIX is real 😢
Nice to see Mr Bean
who up wonking their willy rn??
mans going after big chocolate.
Is this shot in Milan at the Galleria mall? Seems like so or at least inspired by it
Hollywood are stealing ideas from dead men again and putting out work that the original artist would never want to be associated with.
พดาหล
"Hmm,idk. This trailer lacks a flavor of darkness to me."
Timmy everywhere like it great
Diversity: The Chocolate Movie... looks absolutely dreadful.
Old Willy Wonka>>>>
I cant wait to pirate this movie this Christmas.
"Although I love they chose Timothée Chalamet to play Willy Wonka, Im going to miss the crazy  almost psycho stares Johnny Depp made when he played Wonka."
"No, don't let it be another kids movie."
WOWWWWW
I would rather watch movie about Charlie becoming head of Wonka's factory
Knp jhonny depp terlalu melekat pada karakter ini.. dan timothy bagiku wajahnya terlalu kalem..🤔🤔
I have zero interest in this and that is upsetting
but why would they steer away so much from the Wonka I know that is the one played by jony depp...I feel jony's wonka had a completely different personality (which we all loved) and he hated kids let alone interacting with so many people.
I am genuinely so happy that they are not just rehashing the old story and are giving us something different. TC looks in amazing form as ever!
"Can't wait to see at 1:42 that Rowan Atkinson continues to act in the movie
Edit: Yes, of course that guy is totally look like Mr. Bean"
"Im hoping charlie replace willy wonka n inherited willy wonka's crazy mind, attitude n ideas."
I got hunger game songbird and snake vibe
we evne got rowan atkinson this better be good
A nice christmas movie to watch with the family

"So basically, he invented chocolate with drugs on it"
I need jdepp's thoughts on this
I hate Timothée for some reason. He is soo punchable. So... no thanks. :D
Looks pretty booooring
*WTF is this* what a description for some cash
why do i keep noticing race based qouta hiring. its so freaking weird. its like they made sure to have atleast 1 but not more than 1 black person as a cop or 2nd mc etc.  if your  going to hire black people dont single out one in every group just hire a random amount. you can tell it was a race hire. what are they going to do with the oompa loompas? historicaly they were black slaves are they going to make them WHITE?
"It's supposed to take 45 minutes, I'm done in five. Stick that up your everlasting gobstopper."
"Finally after 18+ years of waiting, we get another Wonka Movie"
1:02 there he is
"WHAT A AMAZING TRAILER, OMG"
I was watching the trailer and there was something about how the world and atmosphere of the movie and the vibe that really reminded me of the Harry Potter and then in the trailer they showed that it’s the same producers that made the Harry Potter movies.
"More like ""Woke-a"""
cringe
"Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson, what a strange combination. I have to check it out 🤭"
this is going hit
me encanta timothy
U will never be Johnny deep
This doesn't need to be a movie u already did matilda and that was bad enough
"Ah yes, the long awaited Жопка movie"
YESSS THE ACTOR FROM MR BEAN ROWAN ATKINSON
timmy mejor que dicaprio y dep
"It turned out to be a cool film, but again, no one can compare with actor Johnny Depp and his scope, not in films about Wonka, not in the Jack Sparrow (Captain) movies"

"casate con,igo"
"te a,o timmy"
perfect

shoulda been my bro joey
I need johnney depp to even this movie
"Hmm, I like it!"
Hugh Grant has a role other than 'simpering upper middle class twit' ? Interesting
I’m all set
I think its pointless because no matter what the oryginal will be better
Your recap was on point. You covered all the important parts.
This looks like a nice film to watch.
Mr bean ❤🎉
TIMMYYYYYYY
was wondering when is the oompa loompas gonna show up.
twink
What the actual heck is this i'm still in shock and just no
1:40 mr bean RUN AWAAAY
Ahh..another movie nobody asked for
Statistics Statistics Statistics yeahhh. 😂
"none of his mannerisms or lines gives me willy wonka vibes. this is honestly a miscast, gene wilder would be disgusted lmao."
Очень жду этот фильм
Timothée Chalamet is too cute to be playing Willy Wonka. I love him but I feel he was miscast here.
"Awwwww I loved Johnny Depp's version more. He was energetic, had sass, and hated people lol. I loved how colorful and magical the last one felt. This one feels like a colorless  documentary on old people 😭"
1:15 *nothing to see here. just a bunch of people defying the laws of gravity*
"All I see in every Chalamet movie is Chalamet. Not saying he’s a bad actor, but it feels like Hollywood is shoving him down our throats as the new Di Caprio or something and I just can’t."
i miss johnny depp!!
"OH MY GOD!!!!! I cannot wait to watch this, my papi Johnny Depp and now my baby Chalamet.. What a treat,, I love Warners bros.. for creating this.. I love Christmas movies... Willi Wonka is MY MOST  FAVORITE ever....."
"Wow !!!!1 :o)
I love Williard Wonkard !!!!"
Pay your writers and actors
Mr Wonka like a skin cyclops mobile legend 😂
"0:30 YOOOOO THEY GOT THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORYS and the fat egg man from alice and wonder land, and a lot of other movies

edit: and mr.bean damn"
I will give it a chance cause I looks better then that creepy one.
Oh my God yes I need to watch this movie I watched both the original movie and johnny Depp movie
Another of these films. Uggg
I wanna see this !!!!!
Depp was more cringe than him that means he is better than him😂😂
i can’t wait for this😆
Caillier suisse dd vevey !
bro thought he was gene wilder
Not again?? Ffs
can't wait for this guy to be on the battle pass
Is no one talking about how the producer of Harry Potter did this
"So quiet up and listen down. Nope. Scratch that, reverse it."
ima get a lot of hate saying this but it looks trash
Жопка
WE LOVE CHOCOLATES!!!
Why do they make this?
He Owns Little Men With Different Colored Skin With No Pay But Chocolate Just Reminding ...
"Oh this just looks adorable, can't wait!"
this brings us back when movies where carried by the story telling not the cgi.
I'm tired of reboots and reimaginings but i do like timmy champagne so ill probably watch this
This did not need to happen
Why? Why can’t we make new movies with all new characters and plots and things. Why do we have to take already golden classics and mess them up?
Coming In Christmas
Can’t act.
"Here we go momma, chills🥶"
this looks dire
I love stories like these.
"This seems more interesting than I thought it would turn out.

Whilst I don't feel too much in a hurry to watch this movie, I think this is not that bad."
"will the ""dentist"" have a part in this movie?"
"I will never like this movie without Johnny depp 
I feel like he’s the only one to play Willy wonka ❤️"
Hugh Grant stole this movie. 😂 I'm going to watch this one in the theater for sure. 😂😂😂
I hope we get to see johnny Depp as cameo or should have cast him
😃😃😃
😃😃😃
My favorite childhood story and one of my favorite actors.  I'll definitely see this opening weekend.
This film might be what the Great Showman tried to be in tone. Less their absolute bangers
I like how everybody talks like they're in a Willy Wonka movie.
why does mans look like lil mabu
They have to push woke diversity and feminism into every movie nowadays.
They keep recycling the same stories.
Looks cute.
People will debate about how depp's version of wonka was better than timothy's smh but cant wait for the film
Prequel of Charlie and the chocolate factory
How many times they gonna remake this bs
"Timothee is such a great actor. But seeing him portray as Willy Wonka seems so bizzare to me. It's like casting Danny Devito as John Wick. And you force him to look menacing, skillful and deadly"
You know it's gonna be good when the same guy who written/directed the Paddington movies is also working on this
"This has all my favourite actors, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Mathew Baynton, its gonna be a great movie especially round chrismas."
NEVER KNEW ROWAN ATKINSON WOULD BE IN THIS MOVIE ❤
Another soulless woke checklist
Won't be as good as the orginal but nothing is these days.
"Looks like they pulled all of the fun and dry humor out and paved over it with bland jokes and boring inspirational scenes. 

Please just leave Willy Wonka alone, clean up the print for the original and rerelease that in theaters for a few weeks if you want. You won't have to pay any actors or writers so it would fit in your budget I'm sure."
Awww I'm looking forward to this so much 🥹
"Why does every modern protagonist have a young black girl holding their hands though, It'd be cool to see someone build an empire alone for once, I mean do they now have to explain how she dies or just dissapears from the universe."
Jesus another one? The original is the best and will remain the best. Period.
"Why is side character black?
Woke"
I need Jhonny deep 4that
Didn’t see this coming haha
"Finally, an accurate-sized 1971 oompa-loompa!"
nope.
But I'm expecting the old oompa loompa character😮
"I've been a big fan of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory... and now after many years, here's the story of Wonka - acted by my favorite actor.... WHAT A surprise❤"
Take my money I wants to Watch nows!
Set in America now?
0:24 Confirmed: Flash is in Wonka! It's all part of the new DCU!!!
"Another forced ""diversity"" character"
"It doesn't look bad. I like Timothee Chalemet and he seems like he's bringing a childlike sense of wonder to the character, which I appreciate. It just kind of makes me think about how detestable Johnny Depp was a Willy Wonka. It made me think that nobody but Gene Wilder could play him. Wrong. Johnny Depp just gave a terrible interpretation of the character."
Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa is just priceless! Can't wait for Christmas!
"I know people got tired but someone has to ask..

Who up wonkin' their willy right now?"
Definitely going to watch this on Christmas🤍
johnny’s will be hard to beat. my favorite movie everrrrr❤️❤️
"Anyone else still a fan of the one with Johnny Depp, Helena Carter and Christopher Lee in it?"
Hmmm…just not feeling it. I think I’ll wait and see what Jeremy Jahns says about it first. His tastes are usually the same as my own so I can pretty much trust his ratings.
That looks great.
"""Whoever controls the  ̶s̶p̶i̶c̶e̶  chocolate, controls the universe"""
"He's a good actor, I guess but everything, is wrong. His ""whimsy"" feels so forced"
this looks weird.
"no creativity
reboot after reboot"
not enough token minorities
When I first heard of this movie it was during the whole Jonny depp and amber heard trial and I didn’t think I’d like it but it’s been 2 years and I’m super excited
This is Mary Poppins mixed with chocolate 🍫😂
this isnt even.. the same vibes as the OG if youre gonna make a wonka movie make the personalities right- I would have preferred a horror movie of willy wonka than this ngl
kinda interesting until the blacks come in
Looks trash. I don’t mean to offended anyone but why do they have to have a black girl as one of the main characters. They did it for that other Disney movie and now this.
Hearing the classical Willy Wonka melody in orchestral sounds amazing.
"Looks really cool, but not interested"
wont be as good
"¡Necesito verla, que magnífica! 😊"
We wanted but something we should be needed in this remex
Wao Nice remix
no
Te amo timmy
Timmy's Wonka looks good! He's bringing Willy's character to life wonderfully thus far in this trailer!
"I love how he has a black sidekick. Not Asian, not European but African. So refreshing."
"Here's an idea, COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW."
Why can't I find any DUNE jokes in the comments?
"There’s only 1 wonka, that would be Gene Wilder. Hollywood just can’t help themselves, money hungry as can be."
Downvoted for not enough overly apparent forced diversity.
How will they make this some woke BS?
Fantastic chocolates & how to make them
That oompa loompa is a buck
Is there gonna be a Charlie in it?
"Dem Wonkas just keep getting younger and younger, man he gonna be a toddler my the fifth one"
Its Good but not as good JOHNNY DEPTH

Mr Bean"
"I see Red Bull has competition. 
Would you rather have a drink that gives you wings or chocolate that defies gravity ?"
Yeah you can really tell the producers of Harry Potter made this
So sad we won’t get Dr. Wilbur Wonka (aka count dooku) in this movie.
"they need to just let this go and stop making wonka films. not even johnny depp could make it interesting. this will probably be an epic fail at the theatres, sad :("
We all needed this movie for willy Wonka to have his origin story
"What about Johnny Depp, is he forgotten?"
"This movie has the heartbeat of what I think Roald Dahl would have imagined in his head!! I'm delighted to see this!! (Question why they made the ""other remake"" —it was strange and confusing!)"
"1:01
Did I just saw a legend 😮😢"
Вилли Жопка
WOKE-A
Where is the “may god have mercy on your soul” Wonka vibes?
"I see Mr. Bean, I will watch the movie 👍"
Disney vibes fr
There’s still time to change the main character lmaoooo pleaseee
Every good thing in the world.. Start with dreams.. Amazing
All forced diversity boxes being ticked again I see ! 🙄
Didn't something happened as to why Wonka closed his factory and fired everyone or is that something we gonna see later
"i do not believe timothy has the capacity for insanity of willy wonka, i fear the character will be silly or goofy at best"
is that Lil Mabu?
"a fresh new look at willy wonka,for entertainment purposes..i will definitely see it.."
I searched oppenheimer trailer and Got this 💀 nahh wonnkaheimer
This looks so terrible
OMG I WANNA WATCH THIS SO BAD 😮
Chalomett does not fit this part.
Notice all his team on the comments
Man this new Dune film look so different
Oh again the musucals!!!
"Its a continuous of ""wonka the chocolate factory"""
I'm so sorry but Willy Wonka was perfected by Johnny Depp and none other can give the same impact... 😢 sorry Timothy..
Trash
uh no & charlie and the chocolate factory is my favorite movie :(
I can't wait for Christmas
no thanks
where is Charlie?😢
"so david heyman (producer of harry potter)
and Paul King (director of paddington) are both working on this movie. COOL"
Chocolate prices after this📈
im sorry but no
wrong wonka we are looking for
I got so many goosebumps watching this trailer. Can't wait for it to be out ☺
AM i the only one that hates when people make more modern versions on good movies
Cant wait to see Rowan Atkinson♥
Looks like more Hollywood garbage.
Jeremy allen white should play wonka
scratch that reverse it
Mr . Bean ?!!!😮🎉😂😂
"I came to critique this trailer, as if we needed yet another Wonka movie. But I watched the trailer and OMG I want to see this now too! I guess you could say it had the Willy Wonka effect on me! : )"
Who noticed Matt Baynton from Horrible Histories?
"so what do we learn? The 1920s were much more diverse than nowadays, weird and I thought it was the other way round."
🥱 will wait for it to hit streaming service
"Same mom. Different Wonka. As Timothy steps into Johnnys footsteps, we hope to see the same mentality of crazy."
"sorry, wonka's voice doesn't match, and is not appealing for the character :("
Eh?
"I'm sure I'll get torn apart for writing anything negative so I'll just say, ""looks like a good one""."
"I’ll get hate for this but I don’t care. This just looks like another soulless generic cash grab. I hope it doesn’t turn out that way, but I feel like when they cast big name actors for smaller roles it’s compensating for a lackluster experience. Like why cast Hugh grant as one of the Oompa Loompas"
waiting
Nope. I’m good. I loved the first one and the second with Johnny depp was amazing. I personally don’t think this one will be as good as the last two. But maybe I’ll be surprised 🤷🏽‍♀️
Loads of familiar faces! Looks like a unique adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Most of Paddington's cast is here as it is also directed by the same director. Thanks for sharing. 👍😃 Greetings from London!
"The jokes feel super flat & the movie is giving major Mr Magorium's Wonder Emporium vibes, but way more stale"
it would be hard for someone to play willy wonka  with less charisma
"I think a Wonka origin story is conceptually bad in the same way that the Oz films with James Franco were. You take this mysterious, eccentric, somewhat morally ambiguous character and ruin them with a relatable origin, bland love interest, and a stock-standard hero-villian dynamic. Then of course, most importantly, you over-explain all the little things people remember from the most famous version of the character. The perfect recipe for a mid movie that we'll all forget even happened."
So this is a different take wonka interesting
I don't want to be here anymore.
00:10 LET HIM COOK HIS SPECIAL CHOCO
"OMG, Timmy is perfect for this role!"
Horrible
This looks ok
Is this prequel to Charlie and The Chocolate Factory 2005 or the overrated Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory 1971.
This is going to touch me in ways unimaginable to mankind
To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Johnny depp tribute willy wonka
fascinated
thankgod mr wonka is not black 😌
Looks boring
Wanka factory a startup with other giants now
Gonna watch that only for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
"Wrote this as a fan!

In a land of sweets and chocolate delight,
There lived a man, a whimsical sight,
His name was Willy Wonka, oh so grand,
With candy creations, he ruled the land.

With a top hat and a quirky grin,
He had a factory where fun would begin,
Golden tickets, a chance so rare,
To enter his world, beyond compare.

Oompa-Loompas, singing with glee,
They danced and laughed, as happy as can be,
Inventing candies, strange and bizarre,
From everlasting gobstoppers to fizzy lifting spar.

But beware, my friend, for mischief awaits,
In the Chocolate Room, where the river undulates,
With chocolate waterfalls, tempting and sweet,
You might just end up with sticky feet!

Augustus Gloop, oh what a sight,
Fell into the river, a chocolatey plight,
Violet Beauregarde, she chewed too much gum,
And turned into a blueberry, oh what fun!

Veruca Salt, a girl so spoiled,
Fell down a chute, her tantrums foiled,
And Mike Teavee, oh what a shock,
He shrunk himself down, like a tick-tocking clock.

Through trials and lessons, we all learned,
That greed and gluttony can be spurned,
Willy Wonka taught us, with laughter and cheer,
To find joy in life, and hold those we hold dear.

So, raise your candy bars and give a cheer,
For Willy Wonka, the confectionery pioneer,
His factory's magic will forever endure,
In our hearts and memories, sweet and pure!"
Looks like trash to me I won't be watching it ever
Is that Mr. Bean at 1:02 ?
When i saw there was a new willy wonka movie i did an eye roll but then i saw the trailer and i am so excited!!!
Looks good!
This trailer plays like a parody of every biopic ever made.
You know this movie is gonna be great when the people who made the Harry Potter movies and the paddington movies make it
who let bro cook
They retell Willy Wonka more than they retell Spider-Man's origin story.
Can't waitttt🤩
Can’t wait ❤
"""See, I'm something of a magician, inventer, chocolate maker, so quiet up an listen down, no scratch that, reverse it"" I love that 💀🖐"
MR BEAN
I’m so exited
Can't wait. Getting every second goosebumps thinking of this
I recently got my first job and I think I'm going to spend my money to watch this movie because it looks amazing
OMG I CAN’T WAIT😆
Johnny Deep was too strong for being Willy Wonka before. But I know Timothee would be a great Willy Wonka! Gonna watch this movie!
They got the Hugh just right for the Umpa Loopa's orange.
Main actor makes me cringe
"The likes to dislike is: 357, 371 / 59, 428"
Who likes cats?
A third wonka movie? It better not be too much for people to handle.
"no es por hate pero el willy wonka de jhonny deep es horrible, no me provoco NADaa, la historia parece una burla de la original, creo que timothee y gere son los unicos wonkas (no el abusador)"
"I absolutely love when the movie shows the words “Discover How Willy Became Wonka” and how Wonka is this beautiful looking title, I’m already gonna love this movie"
los que conocemos a timothée REALMENTE sabemos que nacio para ser willy wonka. mark my words.
im a fan of wonka loving this
loving this already
He’s such a ******* wonker 😋😜
I’m glad in this film they took a different approach to the story and instead of having him hand out golden tickets like in the first two movies it’s more about Wonka’s backstroy
Old is always better
My mind is unable to accept anyone other than Johnny depp as willy wonka
is this a seaquel to 2005 Charlie And the choclade factory? becuace its Made by village roadshow pictures
Tuổi thơ đây rồi :))))
Jonny Depp 😢😢😢😢 was my Wonka
1:53 I love how much this looks like Gene Wilder the original Willy Wonka
What happens when a film is shot for the sake of racial diversity:
Timothée Chalamet got sick multiple times during production due to how much chocolate and candy he had to eat ~ IMb
Looks fun.
Too early! We already got a remake!
"So, we all already have accepted the fact that by the end of the film this happy go lucky kid will turn into a lonely misanthrope who likes to torture children?"
idc what anyone says he's prefect for this role
The prequel of Johnny Depp's Wonka
Movie looks trash
"Welp. This sure is a thing that's happening.  Not exactly feeling excited, but definitely want to go watch Charlie and The Chocolate Factory again. Whether it be marvel movies, Pixar animations or any generic cheap jump scare horror film.. I don't know what it is, or maybe its just how trailers are made, but they all feel the same.  Maybe I'm becoming more cynical with age."
omg
they have no movie idea i think it will be not bad but we dont need this movie we watch the same one lol i can help of an movie idea
"Only thing distracting me, (and this is a knit pick) this is meant to be a prequel to gene wilders wonka, but he had blue eyes not brown... like I said just a knit pick"
Prequel Wonka?
cringe x100
"He acting like lead male role in a high school drama production, that’s already been in 4 situationships with freshmen this term"
I am perfectly willing to accept Hugh Grant may be the best cinematic version I have seen of an Oompa Loompa.
"Wait, they really remake Willy Wonko????"
1:13 I can tell this banana orc will be my favorite character
Why thy didnt cast Johnny Depp???
I prefer Micheal Scott
When i scrolled past this I was 100% sure it was fake and didn’t pay it no mine. My thumb accidentally clicked it. Let’s just say that might of been the greatest accident in recent memory
More woke garbage
I think people writing Timothee Chalamet off immediately are wrong to do so. I honestly think he’ll do a good job and add his own spin to the character
I'll watch it in cinemas for sure
as long I saw rowan atkinson count me in🔥🔥
"Hugh Grant is apparently going through a phase of accepting completely unhinged casting choices, first he plays Forge in the D&D movie and now he's playing an Oompah Loompa?"
Oh god the cringe
I love this
Omg i gotta kuuum
"they should not call this movie willy wonka, what gargabe"
Looks great........until some idiot complains real little people weren't used.  Hopefully everyone can just enjoy a good movie for what it is.
Willy Жопка
It does not match please redo
I can sense the woke messaging already. Here comes another Dud.
REAL!
L + johnny depp is the best one
The last kiss 💋 blown by that woman sealed everything for me about this film. I love it.
Feels like they use Timothee just because he is famous but if the writing is good can still be a hit :D
Wonka going Woke!
I would love to watch that Wonka movie! I love the Gene Wilder & Johnny Depp versions and i used to watch those 2!
timothee is not who i expected for this but it works
mn... meu marido está em um filme E ELE ESTÁ SORRINDO SCRR...
Why does this mf look like Daniel Thrasher?
"This doesn't just look BAD, it looks so bad that I have come back to watch the trailer several times over the past several days LOL - About 100 views on the view count are mine!"
"Idk, don’t hate it but not exited! Just wait till it comes out!"
oh god... really!
"And because she’s black, and he’s white, that makes it more special for the audience"
I like old movies better but it looks good 🫶🏽🖤
Eh
אני ממזמן לא בן אדם טוב מבחינה מסויימת
Shoudlve got daniel radcliffe
I don’t think this timothy is not suitable for wonky character
"You get it! They’re self-aware! So it, it must be funny."
W❤W🙌🫶
Definitely watching
"wow, from the director of Paddington. this for sure will be heartwarming"
"Um, no just ""cringe"" on many levels. Not even close to good. The acting is weak, and the ""so called"" comedic part is try-hard. Gonna be a No for me"
Director of Paddington and producer of Harry Potter!!!!! I'm so excited about this!!! Having a heartwarming movie come to theaters is so fantastic!!! It's something we haven't had in a while!!!!!!
No
Oh this is going to be a disaster.  Gene Wilder is irreplaceable.
It’s just hard to accept a Wonka who isn’t Johnny
Willy Wonka 😊
#SoundOfFreedom
"He kind-of looks like he wants your kids, so lock the factory up! 




."
1:50 the woman looks so familiar but i dont really know where i saw her. And since when Timothy Chalamet is so damn fine @@
Nope
"Every good thing in this world, started with a dream. That quote itself! I can't wait to see that movie. I'm sure is going to become a classic."
Too many token people of color. Pass.
"the only thing i'm weary about with this is the obvious use of a lot of CGI. i just think practical effects create such a gorgeous and special film when they are able to be used and add a lot of soul to a project. Hopefully the effects are used sparingly when able and i feel like the cast and plot will be fun, lovely, and light-hearted enough that I won't mind too much either way. I see a lot of criticism about Timmy being cast as Wonka, but I have literally never seen him in a role that didn't fully blow me away and stick with me. He's an extremely talented young actor and I trust him to do this character justice. Overall, excited to see a fun joy-filled movie around Christmas time"
F off Timothee. I want to watch another actor
Waiting list sih ini .... 😍 mau nonton..
This is my Christmas party movie for this year.
AhhhhMazzzzzz ING. Lol I can't wait! 🤗
Idk y but I always thought Jhonny Depp was always Mr. Wonka but now I get to see the younger version of Mr. Wonka from a different perspective. Can't wait to watch this.
It looks great but another one?
No chance this is good
Chocolate is the mind killer.
Omg omg omg omg omg ❤❤❤
"cant compare with Johnny :(
seems so artificial...  crazy acting vs acting crazy"
I SAW RICH FULCHER!!!
L❤
im so up for this movie willi woka i seen the other film with johnny deep as jack sparrow
Timothy charlescharlemagnemane is in everything these days wtf.
Timothee Chalamet ..... REALLY? This is an underwhelming Wonka! 🥱 I can think of 4 other people better fit to play willy wonka!
I wanted to see jhonny depp tho else its good
Cringe
"OH LOOK, another example of the total death of creativity in Hollywood and their utterly shameless greed.  Can't wait 'til 5 years from now when we get ANOTHER, even MORE watered down remake of the same story and/or characters.

How fundamentally repulsive -no amount of good CGI or set or costume design, etc is good enough to cover up what this really is 👎."
"With everything so bleak as lately, this may honestly be the type of movie we all needed especially during the holidays"
They should just make this new Willy Wonka apart of the harry potter franchise with the magic they've added in this.
is that mr bean on church ?
im 27 years old with 2yrs old kid and im gonna watch this hahaha
😮
Possibly the worst casting for a young Wonka. Just looks like he's trying too hard.
"is this prequel combining the 1971 and 2005 versions of the chocolate factory?, because it looks great!"
Is there going to be actual truth in this version? Willy Wonka going to be eating children like the actual story? Trailer starts with him mimicking Baphomet.
Wonderful!! Rowan Atkinson is the besttt ❤
perfect casting
perfect wonka
lo amo
"It Hass to have a sad ending… After all , Wonka closes the chocolate factory for decades"
All I can hear is Paul Atreides so this energy is so wack 😂.
"OMG I must see this, I love Timothy Chamlet ❤"
One slight problem - what happened to the black girl between the origin story and the original that Wonka didn't put her in charge of his empire?
enough with the remakes.. come up with some original ideas for new movies and stories .. hollywood is just lazy and unoriginal
Johnny..
"Chalamet is definitely forcing it. Usually a great actor, but this is not his role"
Really... Another Wonka thing to give nightmares to another generation. Enough with them scary little evil creatures.
"I'm sorry but this looks like total garbage! Don't get me wrong, I can tell they put A LOT of money into it and I love Chalamet and his films (Beautiful Boy, Dune, Call Me By Your Name, Bones and All) but this character just doesn't fit him! We need a nitty gritty Wonka horror film. This is just Willy Wonka in a Harry Potter universe and it's just corny AF. I really wish someone would create a film closer to the ORIGINAL 1964 novel where the lines were mixed between good and evil. Where the Oompa Loompas were actually slaves who were kidnapped from their village and put to work by a maniacal mad man named Wonka! There's just so many things that are being left out and I think the people just want a Dark Wonka film for once instead of the light hearted BS nonsense!

On another note, can someone please remake The Phantom Tollbooth already!!?!??"
"It doesn't look terrible, I'll give it that."
Sorry but that guy from shameless would have been a WAAAAY better actor.
this looks dogshit
"The Oompa Loompas in this movie looks like the ones in the original 1971 movie and not the ones in the 2005 Tim Burton movie. So far, this movie supposed to be a prequel and origin story of the 1971 film. So far, Willy Wonka was the first (probably also the last) human to ever stepped foot on Loompaland and the first human to ever sees an Oompa Loompa along seeing the Hornswogglers, Vermicious Knids, Snozzwangers and Whangdoodles as well in Loompaland and Willy Wonka is also the first human the Oompa Loompa ever saw. The movie probably should have these other creatures from Loompaland, Hornswogglers, Vermicious Knids, Snozzwangers and Whangdoodles to see what they look like."
Sorry..... Gene Wilder did it first. Can movies just stop being made?
Why cant people just mke their own movies? No originality
"I just wanna know if that girl is his sister or daughter maybe bff idk


Edit: Also how does he wear that suit everywhere 💀"
This looks terrible.
i love timmy
They filmed this where i live and i got to meet akanson and talk to the director while they was filming. They was really friendly and down to earth. Cant wait to see my home town with added cgi (its where the ompalompas live)
"Looks like a promising one, IMO."
please god no
Ngl this came out of nowhere...
Didn't really ask for this so it better be good...
I feel like each Willy Wonka movie he keeps looking younger and younger...
I had zero interest in this before but the trailer is fantastic. Looks good.
Still nothing will ever touch the Gene Wilder classic 🍬🍬🍬
Y are the wonkas progressively getting younger with each film
Yep. That's it. Pack it up. We have officially scraped the bottom of the barrel and busted through the bottom to start digging our own graves. As if enough IP or classic films haven't been raped.
I love the respect to the 70s version. The tim burton version just didnt hit the same.
Awwww I love Hugh 😍😍😍
Omggggg I wanted to see an umpanlumpa 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣😜
"Nah bro that’s not an Oompa Loompa that’s a Napoleon Syndrome Personification 💀

Also, I expected this to be based off of the Netflix movie, glad to see it’s the old version this is based on."
It’s just ew
Looks like more woke garbage
Looks terrible
1:50 Isn't that Charlie's Mom??!
"You know, I was worried at first, it looked like a cash grab ruining one of Roald Dahl’s masterpieces, but now that I know the guy who made this also made paddington I think the movie is in good hands. I wonder if Dahl would approve of this…"
I was really expecting wonk to not be white. Idky
Just here to See Hugh Loompa
I can’t wait 🎉
"Not crazy about Chalamet as Wonka (not edgy enough for me), but it still looks like a fun family movie, which the world is in desperate need of, plus Christmas, so it'll likely do very well."
"This looks to me like it's going to be Fantastic Beasts with a bunch of Willy Wonka nostalgia, perhaps a bunch of Gene Wilder quotes so we can all say ""Awww, I remember that!"" I'll go see it, but sadly I'm not hopeful..."
Omg I can’t wait for this
Well they're clearly following Mr. Depp's take on Wonka. Hmmm...
JK Rowlings Fantastic Treats and Where to Find Them.
i like timmy but his acting in this role sounds more like him doing a parody than actual acting…
Nobody’s gonna look back on this. There’s no good reason for an escapee giraffe what does it have to do with anything
Cringe
Конфетки из спайса будут?
"I'm glad this is off of Gene Wilder's Willy Wanka rather than the Johnny Depp one. I like Depp's plenty, but nothing will beat the OG"
Interesting. His pre-story. Hmmmmmm.
Roald Dahl is rolling in his grave. please no Wonkaverse
"this movie was so unnecessary, rehashing old ideas again and again, I guess it's the writers strike, Hollywood lacking originality once again."
That's a lot of token blacks
i think ima turn into a fan of this guy.
"oh hey look, another movie with the fragile looking pale actor bathing in privilege. he is way too boring for this role. aren't there other people??"
" so cool, also as soon as i saw the lady at the end i instantly recognised her from paddington which is awesome since this movie was also made by the directors of paddington"
YEESSS OMGGG I LOVE THIS MOVIE ALR
Wow the plethora of positive reviews here don't seem sketchy whatsoever 🤡
willy winks is the literally embodiment of “never let them know your next move”
Who asked?
I refuse to accept Timothee Chalamet as Mr. wonka 🥲
Johnny Depp reaction 🥸
Noice always wanted too see how it started
When u think wonka u think of treats cakes and candy
bullsnitch without depp. can never top.
Any thing have Harry Potter I will watch it 👌
TIMMMY 😨🥵🔫😔🥵🙊😔🥵💪🥵☺️🔫🥵☺️🔫❄️😡😡🔥🔥😡😡🔥🥵🔥🔥🥵🔥🥶🥶🥶🥶🥶❄️🥶🥶❄️🙊🙄😥😍😍😍😍😍😍
Im pretty sure someone working for the film industry's betted on the 2023 movie flop number.
Cant replace Jonny depp...
I think they mixed this with harry potter
I'm not excited about this trailer
"I'm sure we will learn that the real hero of this story is the little girl... she will probably be credited for having discovered and invented chocolate, and if it wasn't for her then Wonka never would have succeeded at anything in life. You know... keeping with the theme of realism in 2023."
He is the Willy Wonka we didn't know we needed. He is perfect for this 😅
"He's trying too hard to be ""crazy"". The reason Gene was so good at his character was because he was a little bit off in real life. These actors will never be able to do what he did, not even Johnny Depp. It also seems a bit cheesy and disney kid-like, so that might actually make it a success for this generation of children, but it'd fail in the generation of the 70s (when children enjoyed real filmmaking not whatever this is)."
"Он вам не ""Жопка"""
"This looks so cute, I can’t wait to see it!"
"Huh, that's an awful amount of African Britons in 1950s United Kingdom. They really trying to meet that WEF quota, aren't they?"
will take my kids to watch
Wow didn’t know there was gonna be a Wonka in 2023
"I have high hopes major fan of the original with Gene Wilder , Johnny Depp’s was not as good but still very watchable and more enjoyable if you don’t try to compare to the original.  This one looks like a nice reimagining of the story so I’m excited to see it with my  two boys."
I went back to the happy old days when I watched TV with my family on a snowy weekend when I was a kid. I look forward to the day when I will watch this movie and be happy <3
One of my favourite movie❤excited for th part 2 of willy wonka😍😍
So damn tired of nepo babies...
It actually looks like a fun and wholesome movie! Looking forward to it :)
It's not even a competition 😂 Johnny Depp will always be the best Willy Wonka 👑.
Just imagine a young Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka 😮 that would be legendary.
Looks ❤
Ol Timothy seems a little stiff in this trailer
"i think he loses his friend (the girl that’s seen with him) and that’s why in the other
movies he’s really cold and stuff"
Wow this actually looks like a Movie!
I suppose each generation a have a different concept of Willy Wonka😂
Watching this for Timothee Chalamet
they got lore now
I'm gonna go get a crunch bar. I'm in the mode for chocolate.
This better bring back the Wonka brand.
Yuck Christmas
Is this version of WW LBQTQXYZ approved?
This looks shite
Can’t wait
"The movie seems fun, not sure about Timothéé Chalamet as Willy Wonka tho. Ill judge when the movie comes out"
this looks sooo amazing
"Lol! We have already watched the OG classic. Truly, movie industry has fallen globally. Hardly any new movies. Nowadays they (directors) just think about making money. Earlier there were superb movies but in last couple of years there's hardly any good movie globally."
*Yeah Wonka Movie Trailer is nice*
Why does it so und like a nct song ?? 😭
It looks too much like the Tim Burton film
Already the canon is off. He publicly displays chocolate that makes people float but in the original they are shocked by things of that nature that happen in the factory. No one remembers it happening from before! Here we go I guess
Should of got Nick Cage to do this role
Why did I read Wonka as Wakanda?😂
Oh wow how original🤡
"""Dark, White, N U T T Y, Absolutely insane?"" I like my chocolate nutty too!"
ЖОПКА
I came ready to hate... but this looks really good. =)
I feel like Johnny Depp could have made this movie great. Let's see what this guy has to offer.
please don't ruin my childhood
"Wow. This looks TERRIBLE. I didn't want to finish the trailer, RIP Gene Wilder."
"This looks like when ""Paddington"" meets ""The Greatest Showman"" and the two have a baby."
What a joke. I saw the first movie and don't need another rehashing of the same. What happened to new content? F*ck warner bros.
"the chocolate they depict, milk chocolate, is an anachronism and would not have existed at the time this film is set. It totally ruins the immersion."
i think movies are done. there aren’t gonna be any new good ones are there?… 😅
"''No, scratch that; Reverse it 🤓''"
Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka is perfect
Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka looks perfect
Give this a chance guys. I'm gen x so grew up with the ultimate wonka Gene Wilder. Didn't acknowledge the jonny Depp version. This may be good. The guy playing wonka is a cool dude.
"Looks bad.........
Not showing this to my children......"
Already interested!
Daniel looking real good as Willy Wonka
"se ve increible, ya quiero verlo!!"
Daniel Thrasher dropping a bomb rn. I cannot believe he managed to keep his acting career a secret from us for so long!
Came for the Thrasher looking guy
Dang... I didn't know Daniel was also an actor! Phenomenal job Thrasher dear
I can't believe this is what kids are getting for their movies nowadays.
I already like it!
Was mildly interested until the words 'Harry Potter' came up in association with this and then Huge Grant....big pass thanks.
This is going to be a great movie
"i thought this was gonna be another unnecessary origin story but this actually feels magical? idk how to explain it but it gives me the same vibes as some of ny childhood movies, corny and happy-go-lucky script yet still good."
Is it just me or Timothée Chalamet isn’t a good fit to be Willy wonka? Seems not weird… boring…
"2:20 nightmare fuel, pure nightmare fuel 😵"
Why can't they leave wonka alone 🥲
0:40 daydreaming not allowed
This looks so bad
I just can’t stop seeing Charlie in Tim waaay more then I see Wonka
"I'm out. I can't take these things replacing what was once my childhood imagination. I used to daydream about what early Han Solo would be like, how Luke spent the rest of his days. I used to have live action visuals imagined for Disney classics. I don't want to be a bitter old man but here I am. My soul would be more colorful if I would have avoided all these remakes and origin stories and unimaginative sequels and maintained the cannon that was my childhood imagination. These may create a story but they take away the infinite possibilities of everyone's unique imagination. The lights have gone out permanently on billions of imagined storylines, replaced by a forced, formulaic reality. I want to wake up in '98 when sequels could flop and the industry took risks because the data wasn't there yet to force constraints on creative freedom."
"No, the 1st and 2nd one will do💀"
He is talking to children and trying to impress them as a magician. People are dumb f..k who are criticising his acting.
"I reckon Timotei fans are going to cry, and not in a good way."
The world of films has just completely changed😭
And then one of the employees betrayed him and he fired ALL OF EM.
"looks very good, can't wait"
How Willy wonked
When are you guys going to stop using the person of color side kick???...
can’t wait to get lost in this
"There definitely wasn't this many black folk in London 1900 ,the woke brigade strikes again."
yeah..no
OMG IM ON FIRE🔥🔥🔥
They put a black person in it
Ahhh so cozy!!!
Timothy is struggling to sell these lines. Little expression
"I prefer the original, looks ok"
more woke rubbish to me
so this willy wonka was a prequel of Johnny Depp's Charlie of Chocolate factory or  nah?
Damn no one asked for this but were getting it blahhhh
I cannot see him as willy wonka there was one ….and I loved and this is not it 😤
"LEZGO DUDE, SO EXCITED FOR THIS"
I can't wait to see this!! 💜🍫
Timothy for wonka is a bad cast he’s not very good at playing that character
"He's Willy Wonka, not the Madhatter 😑"
Is this a musical? Hoping not@
Was that ROWAN ATKINSON?! okay let me in
"Wow, I love the classic kind of movies. Can't wait to see it. 😍🤩"
Wait im not catching up.... Is this a rewrite version of willy wonka the one with dentist father orrr is this a story about that broke kid that ended up taking after the choc business??
É esse tipo de filme q gosto de ver  ação emoção mistério roupas antigas magia um mundo mágico q n existe eu Sandra amo isso ❤
"It's la POV of Willie Wonka, same goes with Malefiscent."
I don't like Chocolate 💀
Gene Wilder would turn in his grave🫢
Timothee chalamett was created to play wonka
Nothing can beat classic movie ❤

its been a long time since we have this kind of movie and im all for it
"This looks amazing!
I’m gonna give the guy a chance to flesh out his version of Willy Wonka. The settings looks great, the world looks like a lot of fun and I really can’t wait to see more of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa! I’m excited for this one!"
"Is there no originality left in Hollywood.  Ugh, think I'll spend my ticket money on a good steak and cook at home"
Timothee as Wonka is perfect casting
"🙏💍 The whole world is set up to show consequences for doing wrong. All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God.

Why do this why why why
Should have gotten that Jeremy Allen White dude lol
I am gonna miss Johnny depp😢❤
"Its the REMAKE no one ask for kids


If not! Why would people watch it?"
"Love warner brothers, but why why why this is the movie no one asked for

Best part 2:26"
MATTHEWWWWWWWWWWW
GREEDY CEO'S !   Do NOT go and see the summer movie big box office hits this summer .  Send them a message . PAY what people need to live on .
"My predictions:

1. We'll see a young Grandpa Joe.

2. One of the candy cartel is Slugworth."
Nice ❤❤❤ I can’t wait
Ive been waiting so long for this preview. Now the movie in 5 months... YAY!
I already know theres gonna be a millon haters just because it’s a new movie slightly a reboot
I thought this was another reboot again but i guess it’s not
Жопка.
His mama is the same mama as the boy in the Depp version??!!
This looks horrible
More anti-white shite. Roald Dahl would be turning in his grave.
I feel Paddington vibes. Love the style! And the way Jim Carter says “chocolate” is just magical
This looks dreadful
"So it’s a Willy Wonka origin story, I guess that means no Charlie, or no Johnny Depp"
Hope we get to see Charlie's grandfather as a young worker
Chocolate sales after this 📈
"Yo who wonking up they willy

'scratch that, reverse it's

Willy they up working who yo"
"I'm interested in this movie, Wonka"
lots of people are saying that it is cringe.... but that is literally the vibe of willy wonka
Does it include a Hostel TakeOver by Kraft ?
"Dear God, why ? Is there nothing Hollywood will not destroy ?"
Looks boring
Did we not learn anything from Tim Burton?
"finally, a biopic of lil joel."
I’m so excited for this! Not long read the 2 wonka books with my daughter so to have a prequel that actually looks promising is great. Will definitely be having a family trip to the cinema
I love how the actor of willy wonka has been gettinh hotter with each new film
2023 woke level: 100%
I saw this the other day and now I desperately want someone to make a parody trailer matching this audio with footage from Dune.
My two young children LOVE Charlie and the chocolate factory (Johnny Depp Version). I know they will be thrilled when this comes to theaters and comes out on one’s birthday! How wonderful. And HughGrant as a oompah Loompa 😂
Cool
Im watching this because of Mr.Bean 😊😅
meh
Honestly this seems nice 👍👍
Cant wait to watch this movie im excited
Did they learn nothing from the 2nd movie? You cannot improve on the ordinal. Just leave it alone. 🤣What are you even doing?
It looks like this movie has nothing in common with the other movies besides chocolate and an original umpa lumpa. It just doesn't give me Willy Wonka Vibes. But it could still be its own good movie
Still 6 months to go to the theater 😱
why’s he got an American accent the purple bumbandit
This is gonna be a terrible movie
Who was asking for this movie because I will rather have snowpiercer be canon then this
"0:11 scratch that, bring it back (shook shook)"
WILL it be Pg-13?
A black girl in a movie about chocolate? That’s offensive! 😂 😂
Woke
Willy Wonka ko baddhappan ka seedhi Chadhte dekha nahi jata...uss chocolatier ko hame mitana hai....goli nahi maarenge sale ko......
about to be my comfort movie
yes! not a remake woke stuff
You'll never beat the original film
IS THAT ONCELER REFERENCE???
😋😋😋😋😋😋🤪
Eh prefer the johnny Depp one
"Hugh Grant, Timothée Chalamet, director of Paddington, producer of Harry Potter, and Mister Bean actor??
Omg this is gonna be so good I’m so excited what 😭😭"
This is a prequal omg 😩😭
"I dont get it why they showed us Charlie’s mother and Wonka said ""mom"". Is it a story of how Charlie became new wonka?"
ohhh
I just don’t think tim chalamet fits into his characters.
"Gonna guess this one will be a CGI fest with rushed plot, too much music, 0 character development with a dash of token characters that feel forced and don't fit into the overall storyline."
Was that Mr bean 😱
Excuse me omg.
I honestly wouldn't mind watching a new Willy Wonka Movie! Can't wait for it to come out!
Barely 20 seconds in and you have the black girl with the afro lol more woke nonsense.
"Как хорошо, что этот фильм выходит в декабре, как раз то что надо для праздничной атмосферы. Я рада, что именно Тимоти выбрали на данную роль. С нетерпением жду."
Woke bs
not sure.
This is missing the point of Wonka. Lol he's not a superhero why are they giving him magic. He was eccentric like Howard Hugh's not superman lol
Seems good but not a fan of musicals but might enjoy it idk. Has loads of good actors in it
"I’m confused, is Charlie a black girl now?"
0:30 horrible histories icon mathew baynton is here this movie is going to be amazing
Pass on the diversity hires....
These sorts of films aren’t usually my thing but Wonka looks great
"Screammm!! Oh my gosh!!!! TC as a young Wonka, YES!!! And Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa…I can’t wait!!!"
Omg!!! So beautiful!!!  ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Timothy chalamalabingbong
Why are they so determined to wash all colour and life out of everything these days?
TIMOTHÉE WILLY WONKA CHALAMET👑✨✨✨🙌🏻🙌🏻🙌🏻🫠😍❤️‍🔥🫶🏻💙✌🏻
"Trash willy Wonka. His tone, his voice he's flow is off"
this is more better then johnny depp
"""From the directors of Paddington""
Are you sure you want to admit that?"
johney depp is the best wonka and no one will be like him but dont let the latest wonka see this comment because it would be mean
"WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS THE WORST MOVIE TO EXIST, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS THE BEST"
"If we don’t get a scene of Wonka in the chocolate room (pipe room) in the factory I’m gonna lose it.

Or even better, a scene with all the rooms. Even a nod to Grandpa Joe as a helper in the factory would be absolutely awesome.




And PLEASE the post credit scene be the five children… PLEASE.




And come on film, Wonka didn’t have a mother. Only a father who he had tension with. I would have loved a movie that was just an add on to all the flashback scenes we got in the 2005 movie."
"More heartwarming than the kids being grotesquely transformed or traumatized 😂 I like a more intense Willy but i’ll give a try. Also I need at least 4 oompa loopa songs to be satisfied tbh 
Augustus Gloop went so hard 🎶🔥"
Yay Willy wonka and the chocolate factory 3the movie has came out❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Bro is Timothy actually doing something entertaining?
how different it is from the storyline of charlie and the chocolate factory
I will go to the cinema cause Hugh Grant
chocolate with spice
(((the chocolate cartel)))
"Better not cast little people as Oompa Loompas in case that offends. So let’s cast able-bodied actors and deny little people the work. 
Very progressive."
"peak cast keegan michael key, mr bean and the guy from horrible history"
What? They just did a remake with Depp…
mr bean?
This looks terrible
I've been so excited when I heard about this the trailer just gets me more pumped
"Having watched the original Gene Wilder version, and the Johnny Depp version ill be looking forward to this. If its as good as the trailer itll be unreal"
Can't believe people are excited to see a re-run of a movie already made 😂😂😂 Hollywood will be fully run out of ideas by 2050 and be defunct.
Tim is the only person on earth who can play Wonka's character after the great legend Johnny Depp.
A good Mr. Bean Movie.
"Oooo yaaay i loved johnny depp, but this looks so good! ❤️🥹"
I am sold !!
"1:50 Hold on, is that Mrs. Browns?"
1:40 Rowand Atkinson Runnig!🤣😂
i volunteer to be an oompa loompa
"who's writing movies these days? like really, lightbulb above his head turns on when he has an idea, was that meant to be cleaver? It all seams so cheap. Like and intern wrote it. The oompa loompa saved the whole trailer"
No one like Johnny Depp!!!
👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻
Bad casting
Let’s hope the Diversity hires don’t ruin it
"I ❤ when he said ""here we go, mama""."
But didnt he meet the oompa loompas in a Jungle?
Wish we would get a dark willy Wonka and have him as a serial killer who kills bad kids.
umm
👍👍👍👍👍
What a bunch of ___________!!!!!!!!!!!
why does his acting looks kinda underwhelming and lack of energy
noooo the hair is not the sameeee
"Why rehash the same story? Move on for F sake! Is anything originial these days, everything is just tacky!!!"
Glad to see all the diversity hires getting roles - whatever would they do without all the DEI to support them?
"i saw this and thought ew but decided to put my thoughts away and watch this trailer with an open mind, anyway i noticed that i hate timothees delivery for his lines, it doesnt seem authentic"
I see robert atkinson and thats it! I need to watch this!! 😂😂😂😂
"Looks awful, nothing screams Willy Wonka."
timothée chalamet???? omoooo
Huh interesting 🧐 isn’t there already like two other movies of this? Ain’t complaining though
"If The Lorax ever gets a live adaptation, I think Timothee Chalamet would fit as the Onceler"
Gosh the Oompa Loompa is funny 😂
"Hold on, this actually looks amazing!"
I am sorry but Timothy Chalamet is trying WAY to hard to be whimsey and replicate Gene Wilder.
"This looks pretty interesting and more true to the books, but with creative differences or so. But watching this side of Timothy act, I instantly saw one thing after this performance that I hate to change the subject - This dude could definitely play a “Kid” Loki for later Marvel movies 1000%. Hes got the acting chops, timing, and also range. If not only that, The similarities between actors casted as “Loki” through movies compare on a variety of levels, including the playfulness but seriousness of a misunderstood character who comes to rise to glory. Dune, Loki, Willy Wonka, and other roles in comparison see an anti hero OR more of a misunderstood character develop with flaws, but to change overtime and become almost the opposite. Like the original Willy Wonka, where Gene Wilder seems SO energetic and is exhausted ^ Being even a Loki/Silvie character from their show ends up alone, and going into more with a second season ^ along with other similarities I would love to see it happen^

The kid who played in Loki S1 was too young to be the same as actors playing around the same age for younger avengers ^"
Жопка
I love how they harmonized (reprised) the “in the world of pure imagination” in 1:30
Looks great!
Brown wash
“Come with me and you’ll see”
I hope they include his traumatizing dentist father and how he was forbidden to eat chocolate from the first movie
My Mr. Depp Wonka will forever be my Wonka.. Charlie and the Choc factory is my favorite holiday movie.. I watch it every christmas.
it’s nice to see a willy wonka origin story instead of a remake with the kids
WANKA
Mr Bean too🥺
timyyyyyyy
Bro Rowan Atkinson is in the flim.
"Yep. With Paddington director, plus Rowan Atkinson running and Hugh Grant dancing. I’m in!!!"
booOOOOOOoooo!!! lol
Kilt it
Why is Hollywood so obsessed with timothèe and tom holland ?
You cannot take Johnny Depp place . Know your place
"I never thought I'd see the legendary Hugh Grant as a freaking Oompa Loompa, but here we are!"
Crud. Woke. Agenda. As usual. Skip!
when is it coming out?
:)
Looks real good
Mr bean is in here 😮😮😮 1:42  1:02
So far I rate it a……..7/10
"Haha Hugh Grant looks like Lord Farquaad from Shrek... It's awkward yet cool and stupid... A surprise and looks so out of touch ... I do love Timothee to me he's my Bae ❤... And Rowan Atkinson yelling ""Run Away"" is just too funny... When this first was talked about years ago I'm like I don't get it another Willy Wonka movie and one that's a prequel to the original Gene Wilder ? Ok well we will have to see. I think landing a role Tim could do better I wish he was my Spiderman or Nightwing"
I CANT WAIT! 🥹💖
L chocolate people
"This is cool, I liked seeing some familiar faces like Key, Bean, and that guy from Suite Life of Zack and Cody. I also like Timothy Chalamet for this role and the sense of wonder this movie gives."
Looks like it’s gonna be a classic.
"I generally don't like musicals, but do enjoy the other Willy Wonka movies, but the scene at the end with the Oompa Loompa genuinely made me chuckle and now I kinda want to see it."
"Up the airy mountain,
Down the rushy glen,
We daren’t go a-hunting
For fear of little men..."
"Mmm, being honest it, looks like a project based off spark notes. The actors are terrific, but everything about it seems apart from the essence of the story. I loved the book, the play and the original film; everything since has fallen short for the child within me who fell in love with the story."
This look ... mediocre.
Timothee Chalamet in a musical movie is something I do not expect
Nice
He looks like his everyday self but with a funny hat on
I THOUGHT THAT WAS DANIEL THRASHER 😭😭
Wtf is this
Who up wonkin they willy rn?
"This movie looks terrible, Gene Wilder is the only person we ever need for Wonka. When he said 'Quiet up and listen down, no, strike that, reverse it' I was physically sad. It sounds like he's just reading the script, with no emotion or anything like that. I probably won't be watching this movie simply from the terrible trailer quality."
For another wonka movie this better be good
I can’t be the only thinking the looks like a fantastic beasts movie
Why is there a mixture of English accents and American accents? Isn’t this an English story?
I was waiting for the Oompa loompas
"Ehhh I prefer Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, he gives me goosebumps."
Agin? Aggggh
This looks similar to Fantastic Beasts
wtf is Paul Atredies looking to make the first spice infused chocolate bar?
I don't know how to feel about this? I think I hate it?
"Listen, if the director of Paddington is involved, it's going to be awesome. Paddington 2 is the rare sequel (along with Toy Story) that is actually better than the first. It's a masterpiece. If this is even a fraction the movie Paddington 2 was, we are all in for a treat."
MR bean?
Is he the Kingpin?
Seeing rowan atkinson made me wanna watch this move
I see a lot of wokeism coming through his film.
So is this a prequel to the 71 version or the Johnny depp version?
The best thing about this is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. Otherwise this is trash.
I just wish the chocolate cartel was a little more inclusive and diverse.
casting instructions: make it diverse
This looks like yet another flop inbound!
So this trailer is proving my theory that Willy Wonka is actually in a mental institution and every movie he's in is just a fantasy in his head
"It looks good, without timothee chalat or whatever his name is"
i don't timmy is right for this role
why couldn't there be a movie with charlie leading the factory 😭😭
1:07 why does that man look like a failed art student?
Yay leave it to the trailer to basically show us 95.5 % of the movies.. like theres no surprise anymore…. This is willy wonka origin and how his chocolate factory came to be so the ommpa lumpa should be a big grand reveal but nope lets just show it…
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
"I mean it looks fine. Not gonna be remembered like the original or even the Johnny Depp version. I just think its sad we dont make movies for the sake of making them anymore, theres always just a financial motivation and nothing else."
Anyone but Timothée Chalamet
"Wonka doesn't need his remake,the johnny depp version already perfect"
A Willy Wonka movie that isn't a recut from what was originally a horror film? color me surprised.
Cool that we finally get a backstory on newt scamander i mean willy wonka
Wait isn’t that rowan atkitson the priest OMG HE IS AFTER HE QUITED BEING MR BEAN HE IS BACK
"Two questions: What's with the giraffe chasing? And also, why Hugh Grant fits so well as a oompa loompa?"
good to see Rowan Atkinson!
Idk how i feel about this because the last one in 2006 was BAD DOG S@#T
"Woke-a, not Wonka."
No way it’s Weeny Wonka 🤯
Love it! Can't wait to see this! 😊❤
This is a Remake TwT BUT AMAZING!
Wonka movie without Willy Wonka🤨🤨
Everything looks great but him he feel flat. Like it just not hit the note for me.
I’m not excited for this movie bc it feels like it tarnishes the legend himself & this actor isn’t capturing Gene Wilder for me.
no thanks
that last part had me 🤣
Lots of blacks in this for a british story
"Its cringe watching him play willy Wonka,  weird casting."
"Wonka is quirky and kind yet firm and strong to the point of being manic. I dont feel the genuine insanity I need from a Wonka, but still will watch and hope I'm wrong. I truly wish heath ledger were still alive for this role"
😍😍😍
Fantastic Chocolates and Where To Find Them
"If this film does well I would love to see a Sequel to this film about Willy starting his chocolate factory and his workers backstabbing him and him discovering more Oompa Loompas in the 2nd act of the film and it ends with the Wonka Bars getting out back into Production

Imagine if the Film turns into a Wonka Trilogy, that will be sick

Wonka (2023)
Willy Wonka (2026)
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971)"
"I'm pleased this is an origin story rather than a reboot. It looks like it could actually be delightful, which is a nice change lately."
This is my everything - I love it ❤❤❤
Bazinga
too much cringe diversity casting
"I'm not going to lie, Im 42 years old and this film is really not marketed for me, but I really think this is going to be good, full of the magic of the original"
почему он не негр?! чёртовы расисты
"I was going to say no cause no one can top Gene Wilder for me, not even Johnny Depp. 












But I’m not mad at a Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa…"
HE isth back
"Willy Wonka is now Wonka due to him having no Willy?
And here I thought it was because they made that character a girl."
Good to see they put in the Token blacks for wokeness!
Nothing will beat johnny depp as wonka. sorry kid.
"Of course have to get the blacks into it. After all, it's 2023."
Enough already.
ngl his acting is terrible
Yes!!!!  Ignore the freaky Depp version.  This embraces the Gene Wilder version and THAT is pure genius!
And the Oscar for dumbest remake in order to blatantly profit off of a dumb retelling of a fantastic children's story goes to...
Looks insanely horrible. If you think it looks good you are actually a queertard.
Tim as willy wonka is super cute. Gonna watch it for sure but I won’t expecting too much.
shocked hes white
TIMOTHEEEEEE
Trash. Made for braindead morons
"This looks awful. The thing about Wonka before was how simple and endearing everything was. The magic felt realistic because it was within everyday things. Shoving a bunch of cgi and fireworks in to make up for what’s missing from the original isn’t going to cut it for me. Stop sucking the life out of everything wonderful. Come up with something new and stop beating a dead horse. This didn’t need to be made and by the looks of it, it shouldn’t have. Millions of dollars for a lifeless prequel that nobody asked for that changes the already established story.  This is a no all around from me."
No thanks.
Looks great but Chalamet cannot play that character at all damn
It will never be like the original
"Soraya Aishwaria Polfranscheski González si estas aquí es Samuel,necesito hablar contigo no es nada malo por favor."
He said “Scratch that flip it and reverse it”
Why do they keep putting black people in classic European fairytales?
MATTHEW BAYNTON IS IN IT AND HUGH GRANT IS AN OOMPA LOOMPA. MATT LUCAS 2?? THIS CAST
"Nope,give me Gene Wilders version any day 🤣🤣"
Another bomb at the cinema
I'm getting so bored of the meaningless drivel Hollywood keeps producing. The mass display of uninspired sequels and prequels of large entertainment properties created by corporate big shots never cease to put me in a melancholic mood.
I thought Hugh Grant was going to start twerking at 2:20
"Can't wait.. m really exciteddddddd,,"
Lil Mabu as Wonka is not something we wanted but something we needed
"One thing's for certain; All chocolates, sweets and candies will be wiped off of the cinema canteens"
"Ok so I have a few questions, where’s slugworth? What happens to the original partner?"
Of course the girl is....... nevermind
2:17 too late I’ve started dancing now once we’ve started dancing we can’t stop🕺
😂😂 flop
"I think this movie is a prequel for the original Charlie and the chocolate factory from 1971 aka Willy Wonka & the chocolate factory because the oompa loompa in this one is the same one as the 1971 version… orange skin and green hair✨

Also the reason I’m saying that is because the 2005 Charlie and the chocolate factory with Johnny Depp the Oompa Loompas are different and isn’t portrayed as a lil man with a shiny red suit on and a black hair✨

Either way I’m definitely gonna go see it cuz this was one of my fav movies growing up💗"
Lowkey really excited
1:03 is that Rowan Atkinson? 😮
Cannot waittttt
I like that they dont show too much here. Most trailers these days pretty much show the entire movie making the trailer better than the movie and giving too much away. Theres huge gaps here and i like it.
Who asked for this? Who wanted this?
Well at least Matt Baynton is in it.
This looks awful and lacks colour
Maybe I missed it but where was Charlie??
So...this Willy Wonka is from Gene Wilder & not Johnny Depp universe...??
Where’s Johnny tho? This guy sucks
"So quiet up and listen down
no, scratch that reverse it 
ngl he ate that 💅🏽😛"
Boring
"Oh my gosh, THIS LOOKS SOOOO GOOD 👏👏👏"
This onex 4 gen Z oirs was willywonka
Great
"Omg 😮
This is beautiful 😍
I'm happy 😀💕Wonka❤️"
"Wow, using CGI to take jobs away from little people who could have played the oompa loompas"
Finally a happy Film 🎉❤
More PC garbage nobody wants
They ruined Willy wonka with a tik toker
I'm such a wonka aswell
ommmg mr beaaan and one of d classic movies <3
"I especially loved the part where Willy said, “It’s Wonkin Time” and Wonkaed everyone in sight."
"Let the haters doubt. They haven't even seen the movie, just their quick judgements on the trailer lmao. And you wonder why people are always so miserable."
"it would have been MUCH better if it was a prequel of CHARLIE and the chocolate factory, and not willy wonka and the chocolate factory. it should have been a prequel to the Tim Burton's version, not that weird Gene Wilder one. the 1971 changed the story too much, it wasn't a fun watch for me. while the 2005 one NAILED the book, with more story added to it, such as Willy Wonka's dad, which even Roald Dahl's family admitted it was better than the 1971 one. I'm sorry WB, but you should have thought better.

Roald Dahl HATED the 1971 movie, as it has insulted him and his book. he passed away before the 2005 one came out, which his family thanked Tim Burton for making it, saying Roald would be proud.

despite my dislike to the 1971 movie, and my thoughts on how pedofilic wonka acted in it, Its my opinion. and I respect other's opinions as well."
So excited
Sooo many bots on here drinking from the chocolate river lol
This looks terrible. Barforama
"I see that the oompa loompa is going to look just like the one in the original 1971 film, Like that's cool!"
pancake
This looks utterly horrible lmao
"IK, i can always trust warner bros to deliver one of the best movies"
Watched the one where Johnny Depp is Wonka so now it's time. This one looks pretty good
"It's STRIKE that reverse it, not ""scratch"" that reverse it. Right at the beginning of the trailer too. Face palm."
Tried of Hollywood just make some old movie prequel. Is there truly no origin ideas for movie industry?
I would love to see this because I really love Willy Wonka!🍫🍬🍭🍫🍬🍭🍫🍬🍭🍫🍬🍭
Idk man I can’t wrap my head around it majority of me doesn’t wanna watch it in too biased with wilders performance and I feel like the movie was perfect on its own I really don’t wanna see how he started or became Willy wonka I would rather see how Charlie is putting up
This movie is gonna be fun and I am here for it.
Hearing a refreshed and upmastered World of pure imagination song gives me chills. I rrally would love to hear the full version of that new version!
"What is this supposed to be and where is it supposed to be set?
Talk about not respecting the source material, but then that's modern cinema.
This looks like it was made by Disney."
"Smh, lol,🙄"
"""I've started dancing now"" 😂😂"
"Horrible acting, he’s just way too soft and seems less enthusiastic at times"
"No. Please God, no.    *Facepalm*

I mean, other than Rowan Atkinson, there's no reason for this."
I prefer Timothee in Dune 2 but I love me some good Xmas film.
Another Charlie and the chocolate movie huh. Looks sick
Waiting for the movie🍿
Why
Love it already
We need a movie about what happened after Charlie took over the factory.
“How dare you stand where he stood”
"Musicians, authors and screen writers should start making tear jerkers again. People are cold these days! Maybe it might wake some of them up. F*ckin' estrogen fest-but gruesome have 'em thinking about how far this path leads!"
You guys are being dramatic. I can’t wait to see the film!!
Johnny depp is the best willy wonka
Im not quite feeling wonka with chalamet but who knows it could come together well. Jack Black is the Oompa Loompa i wanted but Hugh Grant is gonna nail this part.
Just me who thinks a sad melancholy ending where it ends in him becoming a recluse leading into the events of the film would work quite well?
What I like about this movie is that it’s that it could not be like the last two movies
Please for the love of God quit making dogshit movies. Just stop it.
cringe
The chocolate cartel???
Finally Willy Wonka looks human
This has like a Harry Potter vibe to it
I love Timothee Chalamet but I'm sorry I just don't think he fits the characther.
"The casting throws it off , but quick money"
Hard pass. Sorry.
I can't imagine someone except Jony depp as willy wonka
"Timothee looks good as wonka, however I think he should have been played by Idris Elba"
why they got hitler in there
This film looks really good! I want to see this!
God I love Keegan Michael key
Johnny depp's wonka movie is still the best. <3
Wonka lore expansion.
nah beacause im genuinely so excited to see this-
Lol I saw Rowan Atkinson playing a similar role to Mr. Bean
lol
7 years traveling the world? when did he start? when he was 10?
SO HYPED
I was hoping they’d give Jamie Bower from stranger things a shot as Wonka
Johnny Depp is my fav Willy
So close...only one vowel out!
We all know that it won’t be as good as JD’s Willy Wonka
HUGH GRANT....looks alright...but pushing black america as 1930s britian is too much....
i was going to pan this trailer but after watching it i found it really interesting .... i hope the actual movie is as interesting ... will wait and see ...
When it said 'And the Producer of Harry Potter' it just made it better
I think it's disgusting that in this day and age of a woke society that they STILL think it's okay to take actors of average height and digitally manipulate them to appear short! We don't accept whitewashing anymore so why is this any different!? We have little actors who could clearly play these roles! Why should we accept discrimination against height differences any more than skin colour?! This movie is going to be shockingly terrible! I'm never going to watch this and I hope whoever reads this won't watch it either! Warner Brothers should be ashamed!
tontonan masa kecilku ternyata ada sekuelnya! kangen bangetttt!!!! btw timoti ganteng bangetttttttt
Yet Again they are ruining a masterpiece 😢
His acting seems off. But the rest of the movie seems great.
He looks like Daniel Thrasher
YES
no thanks
It doesn’t look great tbf
"The trailer looks really interesting, but how can I ever see Timothée play Wonka when my soul is capable of remembering only Johnney and his every little expression?"
No one can replace jhony depps wonka
"This was like way before Charlie Bucket, Veruca Salt, Mike TV, Violet Beauregarde, and Augustus Gloop were born when they'll be the 5 winners to find 5 Golden Tickets."
Okay wut
Is it gonna be woke bollox?
Terrible choice. This looks very uninteresting.
We need Johnny depp
lahh TIMMY 😭
"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul? Or what shall a man give in return for his soul?

For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God."

Definitely gonna watch!!!! And i saw Mr Bean😍
"the amount of cgi is a bit tiring... not not mention whoever made this trailer pretty much followed the cookie cutter ""lets give the exact plot of the movie in a series of clips broken up by a bunch of one-liners"". I hate trailers that are the equivalent to those ""movies in 10 minutes"" channels. Don't give us a summary of the movie, give us a reason to go watch it."
"WB loves doing something like this, aren't they? More and more characters got their own movie, putting Hawkeye into shame. Wonder who's next. Alfred? Commisioner Gordon? Or some random hobo in Gotham City witnessing things so much they can make 2 hours long movie about it? C'mon surprise me."
Wonka potter looks awesome!
Jhonny dept as Wonka >
I always knew Heisenberg was Willy Wonka
"Black people in the prequel, no black people in the original, hm? 😂"
Honestly nothing new under the sun. Have we really lost our imagination 😞
nothing can beat johnny depps performance
why is Mr. Carson a chocolate cartel member
HYPE
I’ve waited for this for years Pls don’t mess it up pls❤❤❤❤
wonka ngene kok dibanding-bandingke
"What a shame , good idea but wrong cast, after Deep and Gene Wilder, this new Wonka, Timothée Chalame falls short on all fronts."
Rowan Atkitson!
1:02 Rowan Atkinson?
Finally a movie he actually belongs in
Y tho
Will this be a politically correct version that avoids using short people as Oompa Loompa?
1:42 MR BEAN 🐐🐐🐐🐐
Damn he really does look like a younger Mr Wonka
This looks horrible
Rowan Atkinson running away from a giraffe is one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time 🤣🤣
"""Huh? Huh? A double Huh...?""
Best line in cinema history, diversity is our strength!"
Huge Grant really surprised me in the end. Really excited for this! This looks more grounded and better then the jonny depp one.
Chocolate world 🎉❤
huh huh uh huh
oh its timothee? IM watching
My god what were they thinking casting that wet noodle in the role of Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder would be spinning in his grave.
Eu amo esse filme
Looks fun. Can't wait to watch it.
"How many Wonka movie are we getting, so original another Willy Wonka movie yay lets repeat"
I was skeptical of this at first cause duh another “remake” (yeah yeah not exactly a remake but still)… BUT im more open to it now when i saw that it was directed by the same person who directed paddington (which as we all know is a CLASSIC).. guess im curious for this one
Nothing new under the sun
My kind of origin story - it’s none superhero but chocolate related.
Seems cheap and predictable
1:50 is that the woman from paddington like is it the same actor?
wow Rowan Atkinson is in the movie.
Paul Atreides sure has changed
Why do they have to ruin a classic?
Finally anoter movie of willy wonka.
Ohhh great!! Have to see that movie ❤
"Can’t beat gene wilders Willy wonka, all this cgi and everything is over the top for this movie, the old one felt like it was real in that era this just looks over the top"
"It looks cute and fun, I have to see this movie!"
Wrong casting
All I was thinking is Johnny Depp's Wonka.😅
Crazy how my childhood favorite movie with Johnny Depp is getting another remake 😅
Can't wait for this! ❤
timothée is perfect for the role tbh
Very excited and seems promising... But... Can't really forget what a class act Johnny Depp was in the first one.... Timothée is good... But... Really missing the mysterious vibe
These are the kind of movies we wanna see
Hope it's good
What a trailer it looks AMAZING. The original Willy Wonka films and the Tim Burton film are my fiancee's favorite movies of all time. She is going to lose it watching this. It actually made me cry with joy this trailer.
Is that mosby?
I LOVE MUSICALSSSS
😂😂😅🤣🤣😅🍩🍪🍫🍫🍫🍬🍭🍫🍫🧁🍫
what a perfect film for the holidays
Mr Bean...🤗
I do t get why they keep remaking films especially when there was just a recent remake. There are no original ideas anymore.
iconic
"So they're just gonna make his dentist dad disappear??
Also not sure if Timothy is weird enough to play Willy Wonka??"
This is third third remake Willy works movie
Movie looks horrible
It's good to see Rowan Atkinson again in a film he is a legend
Paul Atreides this is what happens when u watch Barbie
❤❤😊
Follow TheWonkaBoy on twitch 🥰🥰🥰🥰
Doubt it will be as good as the 2005 one with Johnny Depp
"Chalamet might be the worst casting choice for this role 
He made me cringe at least three times in this trailer"
mi tim
SJW woke trash 🤢🤮
mr bean
this seems so good
perfect casting
omg
Is this a prequel?
Am i the only one who saw rowan atkinson?!?!
Good to see Johnson on the big screen
1:40 IS THAT MR.BEAN
IS THAT MR.BEAN ??
"I admit, I was skeptical but this does look good."
I love Charlie's and the chocolate factory so much. I watch it million of times. Can't get enough of Johnny Depp Wonka's character. And getting to know that there's a Wonka's movie coming soon. Oh gosh. My Christmas couldn't be better.❤❤❤❤
It's not the same without Gene Wilder
Genial 😊
Chalamet should get oscar sooner or later
Hmmm can’t wait
Mr Woke himself Hugh Grant.
As bad as Hershey chocolate. 🤢
"Broooo, Rowan Atkinson"
"What's the difference between this movie and ""Charlie and the chocolate factory""?"
Could we maybe nit make thia film the mystery was one of the things in the film that was great adding another film no one asked for. The industry has gotten lazy
Why would you ruin a classic?
Aldulterating yet another classic.
Rowan
Brung back the original cast
Timothee is a gem man❤️
Amazing
I can't wait to laugh at this film in the theater because it looks so bad.
So what is this exactly
This actually looks brilliant
Wait. Where’s Johnny Depp?
Waiting for it❤❤❤
Pass
"Oke, i want to see"
"Are Timothee Chalamet and Tom Holland the only young-ish male actors left in Hollywood? If I'm not seeing one in a new movie or series, it's the other one.

Give opportunities to other talents."
So this is kinda of a reboot and a backstory
"This gonna make a perfect Christmas this year! 

I have been wondering ever since I was young while there are several Wonka's sweet products came out on sale, there is never a Wonka's bar😢"
TIMOTHEE
Idk all I see is Timothee chalamet instead of wonka
Жопка
Johnny depp would have been better at this roll
oh! Mr. Bean is here. The 'run away' guy.
"WHY. WHY NOT JUST CREATE SOMETHING NEW??? THERE'S STILL SO MUCH NEW IDEAS OUT THERE AND ALL YOU BIG STUDIOS ARE JUST MAKING REMAKES, REIMAGINATIONS, RE THIS RE THAT. COME ON YOU'RE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR STUDIOS. TAKE RISKS AND INVENT SOMETHING NEW YOU UNCREATIVE HACKS"
Anyone ever realised that the oompa loompa's are actually colonised slave farmers wonka can not sell chocolate in his factory if his workers don't make the cocoa.🤔 How about make a film about how farmers are exploited and treated unfairly to make the chocolate for wonka and the effect it has on deforestation and climate change. No unique story just retelling old wonka films in a modern setting 🤔🙃 I would like a oompa loompa film that would be interesting to watch.
Oh dear 😂
Yay the 3rd reboot
No Johnny Depp = No watch
He will never be Johnnie Depp
So is this a prequal to the gene wilder movie? Or just its own canon?
This feels like it’s going to be a classic
"Still cannot compare to Gene Wilder’s 1971 role, performance and execution of his role as Willy Wonka 😊😊

The 1971 adaptation is a historical masterpiece and is part of the LOC archives for historical accuracy and achievements for American History :). 

He made my childhood..and I remember begging my mom to let us watch Willy Wonka: The Chocolate Factory multiple times…and she was feeling so damn annoyed and frustrated…

So she played it for me! I am so proud of mommy for ever doing it for me 🥹😅😂"
"We need more light hearted films..but Hollywood says no “Yeah no, let’s not take it up a notch.” “More depressing films please with spooky vampires and love twists that will shock you for life.” 

*”Thank you so much”* Thank you Hollywood and TIMOTHEÉ."
Yh but Johnny Depp gave this character a meaning!
0:55 I know where this little shot was filmeddd it was filmed in Lyme Regis south coast of england
I love it.
I 100% sure that there will be a thing that  hugh grant for playing a ompa lompa and taking work from midges.
Timothy acting seems awkward
is this a tiktoker
No way are we getting a Willy Wonka origin story that's directed by Paul King and it looks THIS GOOD. This might be the first time I nearly cried over a trailer. This truly looks like it's going to be magical.
Looks to woke
"Me: watching the trailer then seeing Rowan Atkinson 
Me: well NOW I have to watch this movie"
Thimothee Is an Icon Chalamet ❤️❤️❤️❤️🔥😎
i am so violently excited for this wow
"Not gonna lie, I was against yet another remake in Hollywood until I saw Sally Hawkins and almost cried for no reason. I just love her! 💕"
So original
Did anyone saw mr.bean🦦?
I hope they use Rowan Atkinsons character a bit. It’d be a crime to have him in this film and underuse his talents
i wasn't looking forward to this at all but now i'm ready to cry in theaters on christmas eve
no
No
why they tryna ruin the og willy wonka name this looks terrible 😂
Wonka is he was real definitely killed some natives and had slaves
The only thing I don't agree with is I reckon they should have kept the Oompa Loompas the same size like the original. Still can't wait to see
"hot take but I think Timothée was miscast as Wonka, he's not as whimsically charming as this character should be. He's more fitting for a quiet emo boy."
Every good thing started with a dream. Fav line of the trailer now I will watch it
"God i hope this movie will be good cuz this trailer was such a ""treat"""
Why not use a proper midget
Mr.Bean.......................YYYAAAYYY
Cant wait for decemberrrr
Damn how much black people
ngl this is masterpiece
Hey another willy wonka movie
This looks like an SNL sketch
I need them to do those promotional Wonka bars too like they did with the last movie.
Primary school ahh acting
I'm angry
Can't wait❤
Stupid
Finally I'm been dreaming and waiting like forever!!!!!🤔 when willy run away from home I was wondering about all his journey and I hope someone answer me when I ask how can a big house disappear like magic 😮😮😮
1:53 is it just me or does he look a lot like Gene Wilder in this clip? He actually had a bow tie on just like Wilder’s version of wonka
On one hand. Roald Dahl might be rolling in his grave. Other hand. I am interested in seeing this.
Hmm... I'll give it a chance but I'm worried by the lack of quirkiness and whimsy.  It's not fair to expect someone to follow up Gene so I won't hold him to those standards.
"Black woman, of course there’s a black woman."
TUH I see y’all not complaining abt this but complain abt every black movie 😂😂 coming from a white person
Жопка
PLEASE I WANNA BE A OOMPA LOOMPA
Thank God it's super inclusive 🤮
АХАХХА ЖОПКА
How did that actor get the lead role? Appallingly weak...
Oof this clearly showcases the expressionlimits and delivery limits of Timotheé.
why we need another willy wonka movie😂
IT'S WONKIN' TIME
who going to watch it cause i am
Only reson to se This is Grant as a that 😂😂
"This is gonna cause a 3rd generation of blueberry fetishists on deviant art, isn't it?"
timothee looks goofy. THIS IS SUCH A MISCAST. he just doesn't have that charisma of Willy Wonka
A public cringe fest? No thanks ill pass lol.
Boring. Next.
Johnny Depp is our Wonka ❤
"""We'll begin with a spin

What we'll see will defy

There's nothing to it""- Wonka"
"it makes me wonder who's gonna play as ""Charlie Bucket""?"
Super excited. ....😀😁
Looks cool ❤
This looks awful and terrible and really bad
Perfect for Christmas time
Why do they cast wonka younger with every new movie lol
"Just like marvel, Warner bros., D.C, Now Wonka has a multiverse ?!?!?!"
"clickin on this trailer i was scared, after my boy peter pan got butchered to death.. but after watching it, i feel excited to see it. xD"
Oh wowww
Nice to see a Wonka Dark Chocolate version. 🤮
"you have probably heard this question more than once,but how to become an oompa loompa?"
"This is not so true, the ommpa lommpa were suplosed to lived in a jungle not kept in a secret shoppe, somebody need to justified this... 😮"
"I was suuuuuuuper skeptical until I saw ""Director of Paddington"".... Now I'm just straight up sitting in wait..."
ehh...Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka still way better than this.
It's good but my willy wonka the best is Jonny Depp
"No se ustedes pero se ve del carajo, sobre todo la actuación de wonka…"
"Idk why but I was a bit skeptical of tim when I heard he was gonna be Willy, but I’m actually pretty cool with it now."
"So this is the story of young Wonka before ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ""❤"
The only true Willie Wonka was Gene Wilder.
Soooo excited!! 💜💜💜💜
Is it weird that I think the humor will be to modern? It's hard to explain what I mean.
He kills children in the future and yet he teams up with a child in this movie. That child will not survive.
"I think neither willy wonka didn’t need a prequel movie nor timothee is suitable for giving that amount of absurd energy. Well I do not have my hopes high for this movie but I’d definitely give it a chance, hope this will be the last wonka movie it already has great adaptations you dont need to milk it once in a while…"
I'm sooo excited!!!
He like a child friendly Walter white man 💀💀💀💀
This looks amazing tbh.
Mr.beast>>>>>>
This is genuinely so delightful and refreshing. Its about time we got a film with some soul again
Is this the real Wonka movie where I can go to cinema on November 13th and fard after eeting chocate?
I don’t celebrate Christmas but its good it’s releasing in December it has those good vibes
I was not prepared for this trailer but it looks good I like there telling a story about Wonka past
gwapo mo mister chalamet^^
Nice
An Oompa Loompa who talks like Christopher Hitchens is rather delicious.
goofy
I mean it doesn’t look like a bad movie I guess
My service dog is named Willy. I had him dressed up as Willy Wonka for Halloween. Too bad it’s too small for him now. But it would be nice to show him Willy Wonka
"Sorry, but you're never going to get a better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder."
This looks amazing! Can't wait for December!
"Happy it looks like a prequel to the 1971 movie, bases on how to oompa loompas look like! (and Willy)! Way better than the 2005 version."
Charlie & The Chocolate Factory movie!
NAHH AINT NO WAY
Its so gorgeous I want to cry
This movie looks bad honestly.Tim does not fit the energetic side of wonka.
i was screaming cuz the set looks so much like harry potter n then i saw .omg im so excited
Why is he so beautiful? 😢
I hope they show why and how he shut down his factory what made him mad at the world
Omfg!
OMG I CANT WAIT
"Never saw Timothée Chalamet as wonka but hey, im willing to check this out"
"It looks ok and all,I just don't exactly see the need 😅"
yes but does he say “good morning starshine 😋😋 the earth days hello 😄😄”?? i don’t think so
Should of casted Kevin Hart as the Oompa Loompas to cut down the budget
Would have loved to see jhonny depp as willy wonka but this also look great
A very different version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Why is it that there has to be a third rendition of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory when there's a second book in the franchise called Charlie And The Great Glass Elevator that's never been turned into a movie.
Is this movie will involved super train moving non stop while the wolrd freezing?
There is Sand in my chocolate.
Why does Hugh Grant’s oompa-loompa look so CGI’d though?? Lol… they really didn’t need to make his face look so plastic
Twink wonka? Wtf?
Driffrent Movie Willy Woka
Mr Bean better get some chocolate beans in this movie!
no.
There's so many things goin' on. I just saw The Nun 2 just earlier and this now. I'm here for it.
My favorite part is when he Wonkas his Willy.
This casting for Willie Wonka makes me cringe hard. Not a big fan of timothee
I admit this looks like it's going to be a pretty good movie but I'm curious as to why there is yet another Wonka movie. I know movie ideas are few and far between these days but at the end of the day I'm hoping this version will be a good one 😊❤
Looks like it was written by ChatGPT
Whats the justification for this movie?
trying to make willy wonka into harry potter
"Ok this movie looks bad

Edit: Is that Mr Mosby?"
"I will watch this after I smoke""."
"So let me guess .. the little black girl is the one who was behind Willie Wonka. 
Naaa 👎🏻"
Mr. Carson !
Where the umpalumpas
At last a movie to match the genius of the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
I can't imagine the lengths that Warner Bros. will go to market Wonka. It would be pure imagination for them to promote the movie via Wonka-themed Hershey bars that may or may not have a free ticket to see the movie.
This movie about to make millions 🥹🔥🍫🍭
"Timmy will be great but Jeremy Allen White would have soooo good, he resembles young Gene Wilder"
"Still confused as to why the black girl is attached to Wonka at all, he's a loner type who cares more for his chocolate than others and anyone in that role would feel weird"
"Wow I guess it's true what they say, Hollywood will recreate movies so many times cause they to CHICKEN TO WRITE ANYTHING NEW JUST LIKE DISNEY!!! BABACK"
"U know U love the movie when it's what it was meant to be. 
Thanks God Disney didn't make this. 🎉❤"
"The set looks great and so do the clothes but the guy doesn’t feel right, he feels like a salesman here not like the aloof Wonka."
Why
This movie looks like absolute trash and I love the kid playing wonka but it looks so bad not sure what these people are talking about can’t wait to see it please smh
"Why. Just pay your writers what their worth so they can make up something new and creative. This is so, so ridiculous."
Ok im definitely watching this once it comes out in cinema's ❤🍫
So proud of Timmy
"Finally, a mainstream movie in which Timothée Chalamet gets to be as goofy onscreen as he is IRL"
"I know right guys, and do you know Chocolate is my favorite 😂🎉"
yay horrible history guy
"I know right guys, and do you know Chocolate is my favorite 😂🎉"
Tbh this is not going to beat the 1971 and the 2005 movies
IS THAT MR. BEAN IN THE NEW WILY WONKA MOVIE
"Hollywood bringing this out with all this hoopla and love basically in the same instant that the west is madly working to censor Roald Dahl's books. The man is not good enough to have his works maintain their original composition but hey, still might as well try to make another billion off of his corpse."
Kind of unnecessary but I think it's worth a shot
From the makers of Paddington? This is gonna be delightful
"Nothing can beat the original 1971 Willy Wonka film. The practical effects in that are far superior than any of the CGI in this Wonka prequel. It’s too bad they didn’t go the “practical effects” route. We’re lucky to be living in the time of Christopher Nolan, who believes in doing everything practical - his new film Oppenheimer has no CGI in it (which he stated in a recent interview) and it looks stunning!"
"Top 3 Wonka:
1. Mr. Beast
2. Thanos
3. Jack Sparrow"
BAD
Another stupid British movie
"It looks good visually, but it's probably not gonna impress acting-wise. It's obvious the actors were chose for diversity reasons rather than best actors they could find."
WONKA WONKA WONKA 😂
He doesn’t fit playing there’s no character just a twink reciting lines
Looks meh.
"All i can say is..

""Look at how they massacred my boy"""
Looks like a lot of fun
Thee worst actor.. oy vey..
This movie is going to be terrible. The give away for me was 0:43 the entire movie is going to be pulling teeth like this.
Look what hellywood vomited
"Aw, Jesus tap dancing Christ. I don't know how to feel about this. The original two were my childhood. Now this... I dunno. I'm cool if others like it but... This ain't it."
Ofc they put the blacks in this movie
I highly anticipate seeing this.♡♡😊 Magical!
Cool ❤️
"Getting odd vibes from this trailer. For some reason when I first heard of the prequel, I thought we would get a more serious type of movie. This movie looks very forgettable, I think Chalamet is a great actor but this role doesn't suit him in my opinion."
I cant stop watching this damn trailer lol
you can not convince me that daniel thrasher isn't the one playing wonka
The ONLY ISM Hollywood knows is plagiarism. Dorothy Parker... true in the 20's and still true to this day.
Mr bean
i have nothing against Timothèe Chalamet but Jermey Allen White would totally crush this role
Lil Mabu 😂😂
This might be the worst movie trailer I’ve ever seen in my life
hehe
"Mr. Wonka, IT'S JULY! You expect me to wait for December for this masterpiece? 😢"
"Bad trailer, showed too much. I now really don’t feel like I’m missing out on anything"
I guess we can't just be original anymore
Looks stupid
"Timothy Chalamet looks so much like my ex girlfriend, it's distracting"
This is a perfect cast
🎉🎉🎉🎉
Casting him as Willy Wonka is the worst film making decision I've seen😂😂
eh? johhny depp did this in 2005. whats the point of this?
Who up wonkin they willy rn
"had to put the woke inclusion ""black girl"" to ruin a great piece of history     ill still watch it though"
0:10 I cringed at this
Damn it now I want to watch this
oh god no
That looks cute. I will be first in line to see it.
"So...is this a prequel to Johnny's or to Gene's? I say Genes. Their outfits are almost identical. And his demeanor seems more on the crazy, OCD side like Gene's version"
Warner Bros is killing it lately! ...whilst i felt nothing remotely similar like this related to anything by Disney lol. Just a thought that crossed my mind. I'm gonna watch Barbie and Wonka (and Oppenheimer by Universal) which is weird because I don't go to the cinema very often.
I wish the director did a better job instructing the main character. The anime-voice exaggeration makes my ears bleed
OUUUU  this looks so good i cant wait for it to be releasedd
Who wants a chocolate that makes you fly!?
D888
Another movie to look forward too😆😆😁😁😁
"This is less Willy Wonka, and more Mary Poppins to me. I’m skeptical about this one"
"Chalamet is a wonderful actor, not feeling him in this role though. Still hoping its a solid movie, just not sure if he can pull off the zaniness of being Wonka."
You may modernize but never beat the original!
Mr. Bean is that you ??😅
Dont mess with de chocolate cartel mayne
Never thought Daniel thrasher would take up chocolate making
TIM BURTON ?
"I zoned out watching this, sorry."
Cant wait for this!!
Did willy wonka told everyone that they stole the chocolate beans from central américa and méxico to take to europa and make them selfs famous from cultivating chocolate beans from  hundreds and hundreds years before them? just a question from my ancestors!!!
I like him better than Depp.
DEI strikes again. Looks like trash. Can’t wait to not watch it. 😂
I'm not excited for this at all
It would have been better  if he sounded more like Gene Wilder's rendition.
жопка
"не умеет он играть сказочные роли, требующие мимики, его максимум - томно смотреть через камеру на писяющихся девачек
до него это уже сделал шикарно депп, а теперь на контрасте выглядит совершенно невыгодно и мерзко"
this  looks  so good!!!
this is who its done
"Damn, I’m not watching the new wonka just because it’s this dogshit actor doing it. For sure Im not watching and it’s sad because I would have like to but this dude is annoying asf"
Criiiiiiiiiiinge.
I wanna see a fat boy get stuck in the chocolate tube if that ain’t in this movie I don’t wanna see it
"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of my favorite movies of all time. Gene Wilder left *huge* shoes to fill and from this trailer, Chalamet is not a convincing Wonka. Disappointing. Of course, I would LOVE to be wrong about this and would enjoy being pleasantly surprised. But as of now, I will likely just watch the film eventually on streaming or dvd."
Timothe just so cringe
This looks very bad. Please no.
"I'm going to give it a shot. But if I can be completely honest, this looks like hot garbage."
Yo they got lil mabu to play Willy wonka
OMG I CAN NOT WAIT. Every time I see this preview I get chills the whole time. So happy this isnt a remake and looks to be an absolute masterpiece!!!! ❤❤
Is this like an origin story of Willy Wonka
YOOOO MR BEAN 😮😮😮😮
Johnny Depp 😢
"So, this is like The Harry Potter Franchise saying ""Hey Tim Burton; F.U."" ??"
"Oh God, this looks dull, and lame."
lame
NOPE just NOPE!!!!
Too bad it’s not period correct.
I hope with future remakes of any show or movie they do it justice and they dont overdue but this one might actually be good
0:59 REGGIE
I wish the actor was 30 year old Johnny Depp :(
"Long love the fighters! Oh, whoops, wrong movie.."
"Kind of annoyed that people are complaining about Timothy being too much like ""himself"" in the movie. What so you want him to be depressing? I think this looks really good, just give it a chance"
Fizzy lifting drink wasnt invented even during Willy wonks and choco fac… what the f
Sigh
Why
"Sorry, after the deep/burton fiasco I'm not interested."
Miss the laugh but there's nothing to be seen
that looks absolutely not for me
"if this film does not include a reference to Snowpiercer, I will cry"
Weird movie
"who else wonking their willy, fr fr"
"As a kid growing up watching the original. I'm a huge fan. This looks like it could be very promising. After the abysmal Johnny Depp remake, I truly hope so."
"Good cast, potentially good castING, but can we get an original idea out of Hollywood instead of retreads just once? Please?"
"Huh, that was a rollercoaster of emotions in a 2 minute trailer!  First I was doubtful, then excited, then teary when I saw Sally Hawkins as his mother, then laughed out loud at Hugh Grant!!  I'm sold!  Looks like maybe a musical too??  Doubly sold! 😅👍"
"WTF I DIN'T EXPECT THIS.
AND ROWAN ATKINSON?!?!?!

THIS WILL BE A *SWEET TREAT* AND A *SWEET DAY*"
"Honestly, who is asking for this? Who's the intended audience? I cant fathom kids today connecting to this."
The only thing good about this trailer was the half second of Matt Lucas and the 3 seconds of Hugh Grant. Does anyone need a Wonka origin story? Unless it ends with a tragedy that compels him to build his candy torture chamber murder factory then it's pretty pointless.
"With Peace and Love, Johnny Depp's portrayal of Willy Wonka is the best for me. Even the OG one can't win. Timothee's Wonka kinda boring for me."
Yes
looks woke!  looks dreadful! Hugh looks good but cannot save this POS!
This looks so awful
Okay. I saw this thinking it’s gonna be another trashy remake. But after watching it. I’m hoping it’ll be good. I’m glad they’re sticking to the OG version too
"""Lollipops"""
naur
Looks leaps and bounds better than the Time Burton rubbish
I am a simple girl. I see Wonka and I click.
Is this a joke?
I like the idea but I realllyy don’t like chalomet as wonka
"I've got a feeling that this is going to be yet another fantastic film! Just by watching this, says it all!!"
"I sincerely hope this is good. not banking on it, but hoping"
Well my enthusiasm for this movie completely dropped after seeing this trailer.
I'm offended that you don't have midgets cast as Oompa Loompas.
Damn mr bean randomly in the middle is hilarious
"From Paul Atreides to Willy Wonka, I wonder where his talents take us to next."
"""Wanka""."
Why not make a reboot of the charlie and the chocolate factory movie instead?
I don't mind the actor they chose for willy Wonka he looks the part but this movie looks like garbage 🙄
Too late. I've started dancing now. Once we've started dancing we can't stop
Is it just me or did I see Keegan Michael-Key
*Wanka
This move is gonna a big nope and I can smell it
"ARGHHHH so exciteddd i've been asking my sister why they wont make another Charlie & Chocolate factory movie because it will be such a great hit. and now i cant believe theres another oneeeee
.
.
p/s eventhough i expect different moves ahhahah but its okayy"
Но это жопка...
This is going to be a classic
"i’m a simple girl, i see timothee chalamet and i click on the video🤷‍♀️"
Is anyone else tired of seeing the same three actors starring in every film? I wish Hollywood would widen their casting pool a bit.
"Man, I was cringing hard through that whole trailer but when Hugh Grant showed up I actually laughed a little. Hmmmmm."
Ig this is another musical….
Woman actress 👌
Haters back down. I 100% support Timothy in this role
Am I the only who thinks that Timothee Chalamet looks like Daniel Thrasher?
It’s gonna be weird seeing him in basically an open world setting
Y if you're exited
"Willy Wonka is a Wizard by dear-tumb1r

“Mr. Wonka,” Dumbledore smiled warmly, looking down into the Pit from his podium. The members of the Wizengamot muttered disapprovingly, shifting in their seats. Willy Wonka, clad today in a bright magenta suit and tophat, beamed cheekily up at them from his chair, his silver-gloved hands cradling his chin. 

“Mr. Dumbledore,” He replied brightly, with the barest hint of a lisp. 

“I trust you know why you are here?” Dumbledores question was crisp and businesslike, but the twinkle in his eye gave away his amusement at the situation. 

“Not at all! I’ve nary a clue,” Wonka wiggled his eyebrows. Dumbledore audibly stifled a laugh. 

“You are accused of improper use of magic, improper use of muggle artifacts, and several counts of using magic in front of a muggle,” Dumbledore reminded him. He conjured a projection with his wand. Displayed in grainy sepia was Willy Wonka, arm around a boy of around 10. Behind his back, he twitched an ash wand, and machines in the background around them whirred to life, producing all manner of sweets. 

The projection ran its course and collapsed, and Dumbledore stowed his wand back inside his robes.

Wonka smiled and fiddled with his hat. 

“How do you plead?” Dumbledore asked, leaning forward eagerly for what would surely be an amusing trial. 

“Not guilty on all counts,” Wonka said, perhaps a tad smugly.

The members of the Wizengamot muttered amongst themselves. Not Guilty? Impossible!

Dumbledore hushed them quickly. “Explain, if you would. We have, after all, quite a mountain of evidence.”

Wonka stood and brushed a bit of dust off his suit. He tipped his hat mischievously. “Of course,” he grinned. 

“Firstly, use of magic shall only be considered improper whereby it is applied to cause harm or applied recklessly. All magic used in my sweets is rigorously tested for both safety and taste. It is not used to cause harm, but to bring joy.” Wonka paused to adjust his jacket. 

“But surely,” Dumbledore said, leafing through his notes, “you cannot deny that you illegally charmed several thousand muggle artifacts?”

“Ah, but I can,” Wonka said, now twirling his cap in his hands. “Muggle artifact refers, of course, to any muggle made object. But, you see, I built those machines, each and every one. They are not muggle machines at all, but wizarding machines, built by a wizard. The factory itself, as well. You could argue that, as machines are a muggle invention, I still broke the rules, but then I could argue that every wizard dwelling with any charms applied to its walls is in violation of the law, as muggles were the first to make bricks.”

The Wizengamot glared silently. He was right, of course. Violating the spirit of the law was not illegal if one followed the letter. 

“And the last charge? These are definitely Muggle children, are they not? No magical talent, raised in muggle society?” Dumbledore straightened his glasses and peered down at Wonka, his eyes still bright with intrigue. 

“Not at all,” Wonka grinned, placing his hat back on his head. “You see, the ticket system was not nearly so random as I pretended. The tickets were charmed, they would only becomes visible to children with magical heritage. All the children chosen were second generation Squibs.” Wonka bowed low, as if he were finishing a particularly well executed play. 

“Well, ladies and gentlemen, it seems no laws were violated after all.” Dumbledore stifled a grin at the groans of angry disapproval from the Wizengamot. 

“But he very clearly violated the intent of the rules!” Spluttered a large, rather red faced wizard in the second row. “He’s just…cheating! He’s cheating!”

“Ah, this is true, but he did not, technically speaking, break any of the rules. He did not expose muggles to magic, nor enchant muggle made objects, nor improperly apply magic anymore so than any magical confectioner. I’m afraid we have to let him go.” Dumbledore smiled gently and put away the rather thick file with Wonka’s name embossed on the cover. For the brief second it was open, a list of hundreds of charges with “Not Guilty” inked beside them was visible. It was carried off by a house elf, and the Wizengamot began to file out until only Dumbledore was left. 

“You’re a very clever man,” He called down to Wonka. “We could use you at Hogwarts, you know.”

“No thank you,” Wonka called back, grinning. “Skirting the law is far more fun!”"
Looks absolutely horrible!
Looks silly and wrong
Not feeling Chalamet as Wonka
I hope that's wonka slave
I’m in!
Cringe :0
Ok. Gene Wilders Wonka is one of my favorite movies ever.  I didn’t like Johnny Depps.  This looks good.  A different pov and more unknown stories of his life before the golden tickets.
"Mmmmmm yeah, this guy definitely read a script for this movie"
I like it and will watch it
"Now make a horror version! Pure Imagination 

'Cut to out of tune jukebox music'"
Nadwar really got a movie huh
Jeeeeezzz December?!
It’s a little funny because he looks like how I imagine Charlie would be after taking over Wonka’s chocolate factory 😂 I think it is a nice spin-off/prequel to the story’s origins.
"The ""here we go Mama"", got me right in the ❤"
It comes down to if they can tell the story well and if it’s a good story which I’m really hoping for
Is this movie just for reparations?
Finally some creativity in the movie making world.
Another overhyped backstory remake…
"At last, a movie that makes us want to feel good about Christmas, endless chocolate and the return of an iconic classic.  We’re coming for you, Veruca Salt and Augustus Gloop! 🎩"
Am I the only one who thinks Timothee as Wonka is terrible?? He doesn't suit the Wonka character.
Movie looks cornier then the others.
Hugh Jackman would have a made a better Wonka.
"At this point, I'll watch anything without a political message."
What are the odds this is going to be an excruciating POS?
"""how will we ever compete with these other corporations??""
Willy wonka: ""well there is this race of small people that are willing to work for free. Thats gotta do wonders for overhead costs"""

TIMOTHEE AND ROWAN ATKINSON I HAVE TO WAYCH THUS
chocolate must flow....
Will Bruce Berman be in executive producer for Wonka?
"Я уже по трейлеру, уровню шуток и кадрам понимаю, что фильм будет полным говном.
Джони Депа вам уже не обойти. Он был лучшим Мистером Вонка"
Jim Carter's voice ❤
"Im a HUGE Timothee Chalamet fan and was ecstatic when i found out he was playing this role some months ago...but his performance in this trailer feels a bit of a let down to me. I love the fact that the movie is more of an origin story than a retelling of the chocolate factory, but Timothee honestly doesn't seem well suited for the role seeing this. It doesn't feel naturally fantastical at all, it feels very forced. And that's coming from someone who absolutely wants Timothee to succeed"
Good god is Hollywood EVER going to make a new idea ever again????
"Wait, so he was making crazy things like chocolate that makes people fly, BEFORE he even had his chocolate factory? I was always under the assumption that the ""crazy"" stuff inside the factory was all experimental and not ready for the public yet, and that the stuff sold in the shops was just regular chocolate (such as the Wonka bar and the Scrumdiddlyumptious bar), so everyone was surprised by all the crazy stuff inside the factory."
it just feels like a rehearsal on a bad day. low energy
"wow nice! if freddie highmore was on his mid 20s, i bet he also will make a remarkable portraying willie wonka😊"
"The Trilogy is now complete 

1. *Wonka*

2. *Willy Wonka*

3. *Snowpiercer*"
"Hello, Humans
Don't put all your effort into a human, that rejects you at every turn.

Yay!!!! The movie nobody wanted!!!!!!
Will this be good?
More soulless cinema.
Love Timmy but this does not look good.
F' this and Dune! Copy-paste garbage...
Willy Wonka And The Diversity Factory...
He wants to be Jim Carrey so bad.
Se ve increible!! Timothee me compró con este papel!!! diciembre llega ya!
F' you. Enough with the remakes! F' you...
"Honestly, the role doesn’t suit Timothée"
Stupid one star
This shi looks trash asf
I think this is genuinely gonna be good f the haters
I’m going to be honest I don’t like this.. I love Paddington.
Yes people who made chocolate...changed lives....called diabetes
This looks absolutely unhinged and I am 100% here for it
This is probably the worst rendition of Willy wonka.
"I had a dream about willy Wonka the night this movie trailer came out, what a coincidence"
1:08 I'm so glad they are going to keep his kill streak up.
my guy looks like phillip gallagher
Willy Wonka has always been the best character ever it's so nice to see finally have a stand alone willy wonka movie but i also need an Charlie tribute and also Johny Depp made Willy wonka iconic but i know Timothee can pull it of nice
Literally every line Timothy gives off is horrible
Oh my God what!?!?!?!
What makes this movie sad is Wonka does all this just to go recluse later in life to give it all up😢. I wonder if it will show that
Gr8 casting sure this will be fantastic  but Gene Wilder will always be the best  for me remember watching the film on VHS for the first time it was magical im sure the kids of today will say the same either of Johnny depp  or Timothée Chalamet
Is nobody going crazy that TIMOTHEE CHALAMET is playing WILLY WONKA????!?!?!?
Жопка
How many mf movies can we make off other movies gd
Matenaiyo~~
"Ah yes, the obligatory forced diversity."
Tim the future of hollywood
"The delivery of wonka feels off? And the ""jokes"" too."
This feels very corporate.
Ive been saying this for years.... chamalet is surely the next Johnny depp... I can see that entire personality becoming the next favorite to tim burton
Hard to watch this without Johnny Depp so although I'm disappointed I'm curious 🤔
Hard pass.
So we are in a age where blacks have to be in every single movie. No matter what. Absolutely ridiculous. Get woke go broke. 🤦🏻‍♂️
Nope.. Not excited abt this...
Wonka movie july 14
“A world of pure imagination.”
"Some movies you just need to leave alone and Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka is one of them, he did not approve of the Jonny Depp remake and I'm sure he would not be happy about this one, the original was perfect in every way, leave it alone already."
was that mrbean?
"We are the Dream Makers, and we are the Dreamer of Dreams."
"Oompa Loompa this is so cool!
If you ask me any hater of this movie’s a fool"
No
"Once again, Hollywood is regurgitating a classic movie because they can’t think of any original ideas."
Am youtuber
"After the shot of Sally Hawkins throwing a kiss, I was sold."
I would've preferred it if they would've gone a lil darker and more serious tone for the origin of Wonka but oh well
Not sure how to explain why but I hated everything about that 😂
If 2020 tiktok were a film
Again?
Cannot wait for this 😊
"After Hollywood's dismal movie output so far this year, this looks refreshing. This...and the upcoming Napoleon movie with Joaquin Phoenix. 🎆🎆🎆"
Seems like a beautiful film but the timothee casting seems forced 🤷🏽‍♂️
Warner bros are on a role first Barbie and now Wonka.
This is more exciting than barbie and oppanhimer for me
MATHEW BAYNTON OMG
Get woke go broke
"Everyone has lost ideas, now they are just making new movies of old ideas."
"He’s somehow channeling BOTH previous film portrayals, while also doing something original. I hope this film incorporates Wonka being a man of somewhat dubious intent."
Another wonka!!!! Woohoo!!!!!❤❤❤❤❤
YO THAT OMPA LOMPA GOT A DUMPY THO GOD DAYUM
omg guys LETS GOOOOOOO!!!!!!
The PERFECT Christmas movie!!
Of course they had to made his side kick a black girl
"Oh how I wish Christopher Lee could reprise his role as Willy's father. The introduction of the relationship between him and his mother is so exciting, I'm interested to see if her overwhelming support is able to outweigh his father's disapproval or if that will be an internal battle he has to face. Regardless, I just hope they don't completely disregard his father's impact"
Timothée Chalamet has become an excellent actor with this and Dune. Outstanding.
I dunno. The reason Roald Dahl never gave Willy Wonka much of a backstory is because he didn't need fleshed out one.
Was this filmed before after or during he whored around with a Jenner?
Black people as police in Britain in the days it was set?  Very realistic.
THANK GOD MAYBE WE CAN GET BACK INTO THE VIBES LIKE IN THE 1990s!!!!!!!! BLESS
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is legendary.
"From the producers of Harry Potter, followed by solemn vow? Immediately all the fan theroies about George Weasley came to mind! I solemnly swear that I am up to no good..."
ooooph rough.
absolutely admitting this. I’ll Put this on my movie list. I can’t wait till Dec15th.
This is already looks so good. I can’t wait
After watching this I am now craving for a bag of chips.

This looks absolutely terrible 😮
😂😂😂 Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
this looks like it’s going to be so so bad
MR. BEEEEEEAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN!!!
Is it a musical?
His dead eyes
Troye Sivan Should have played Wonka.
Haven’t you noticed the names of these movies are getting shorter so that means the next one is going to be called W
I hope they include his dentist dad
"Gee… no mention of the dentist father in the trailer…


A good thing I think."
This is how they made MDMA
❤️❤️
When I first saw the title in like please no not Another copy of a copy of a copy but this looks quite interesting.... OK WONKA
"51,000 downvotes for those who can't see them. We've had enough of this woke nonsense being shoved down our throats in movies!"
“Who asked for this” is a question Warner really need to start asking themselves
childhood memories ❤
"Omg! This is going my fav movie period !!!

Respectfully Always,

BWhovion"
Sprry but Timothy got wrongly cast. His performance is not believable and hi looks misplace.
"I'm not sold on the casting, but we shall see 😑"
"Willy: ""I'm having a hard time picking a name."" 
Cringe forced sidekick character:
""I know, Wonka."" 
Mark my words."
Not another reboot. There is only one Wonka and that was Gene Wilder PERIOD.
I was skeptical right up until Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa…SOLD.
0:09
"feels uncanny to the point where it feels forced, hope they do justice to the original in post production."
"This looks good. I can’t wait to watch it. 

This trailer is probably what Disney thinks their live-action trailers look like. Let them continue to dream! 😂"
Trash
Looks good
NAH
This looks like a Family Guy cutaway ! wow !
this might be good😕
I don’t think Timothee is charismatic enough. Or Johnny just casts too huge of a shadow
"О, это же мой любимый фильм, жопка"
IS THAT THE TITANIC?
"I like Timothee as an actor, however, this role didn't feel right as I watched the trailer. This definitely isn't a movie for me. With a holiday release it should do well with kids/families during the Christmas season. I thinking family fun at best, but not a genuinely good movie."
"Does anyone else think that Timothée Chalamet sounds like he’s trying to be the next Eminem in this trailer when he says “So quiet up, and listen down. Nope, scratch that, reverse it.” Just me? 😂"
"The forced child sidekick character is kinda getting annoying and cliche as of recent, but other than that, this looks pretty solid."
Why the heck do we have to remake everything. Isn’t anyone independently creative anymore??
we are so happy for you Timothée and very proud of you!
0:18 feels like an SNL character
"Chalamet is a great actor...
But he was MISCAST as WONKA 😮"
"Why do the Oompa Loompas, from an isolated island in the Hangdoodles, have the accent of a British gentleman?"
Miss jhonny depp he would have been more suited for this role if he was some year younger 😢
estoy muy emocionada por esta película
Looks too over the top cheesy. Why the need to make it that way? 🤷‍♀️
Omg I can’t wait 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
There is only one true Wanka and Gene is his name…..
Timothee Chalamet is too young and hot to play Willy Wonka
"Trailer only drops 2 days ago --- 20k comments, 318k likes in that short time ---  this movie is already magical.  I can't wait to see it."
"Why I see and hear Karl Jacobs to
him ( Timothée Chalamet). Can’t wait to see this on December. Yipee!!!!"
Did they just white wash the original material in the book????? I still wanna see it
"Looks interesting, but I'm not sure about the sidekick.
Don't care what colour the skin may be, I'd be saying the same if it was white, brown, or sky blue.
I'm just not sure how they will insert a sidekick into what amounts to a prequel style film."
Not really feelin Timmy for this role 😕
1:03 Could this be Agatha Trunchbull?? Like a crossover between Roald Dahl's Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory???
"I think that the premises of this movie is for him to do this for his mom, cousin trailer he says this here we go mama"
Can’t wait❤❤❤
charlie in the chocalate factory willy wonka still in my heart
Flip flop Skip Scott dipped off new op... yeah  about as good as that...
Cringe
Will Simon Farnaby show up as a raunchy security guard?
"A backstory for Gene Wilders wonka which we love to see, my only hope is that a little light is shed on why wonka wanted to essentially teach the parents of the four bratty kids a lesson in parenting. It looks like wonkas mother is in this which makes me think he didnt have a bad upbringing, so maybe he thinks everyone should be raised in the same way he was? I don't know but I'm excited nonetheless"
oompa loompas looks like a monster
"Man, I’m going to see this movie in theaters"
Chalamet's acting range is insane.
Looks good but does anybody think it’s odd that a musical movie is completely downplaying the music?
The only doesn't make sense is how does he have black hair and then when he gets older he turns blonde it's not how genetics work
"Wow, can't wait to watch it 🎉🎉🎉"
"This very much looks like a Christmas release. Seems to have very little relation to the Dahl version, aside from re-purposing characters.
Could be good, but it's definitely different. I don't feel Chalamet has the right brand of ""a little off"" as Wilder, or even Depp."
The guy playing Wonka sounds like he is reading a book to kids.
ok this looks hella cute n fun XD
Harry Potter vibes 😩
"Hugh Grant is like a fine wine, he only gets better with age, and him being cast in this film is proof of that."
This is what Hollywood needed. A back story not a remake 😊 tired of those
Wow can't wait for this movie 😊❤
this looks fun
Mr. Bean
Honestly it's nice to see a heartwarming movie coming to theaters for a change. I feel like the cast and crew had a lot of fun with Wonka
This feels like a movie with a soul
I have no idea why but I really like the feel for this movie. Will definitely be watching!
Looks stupid. I'm sure it will be a hit as there is no shortage of stupid people who will watch it.
so suprisingly can't wait 🥹🥰🌸💋🫶🏻
Why reboot something when the original was already good. This is nothing like Roald Dahl's book
We have to stop making movies
Booo! Nobody asked for this! Do something original!
He's getting slayed for this trailer and the performance looks good so far lol
"Wonka character seems too wholesome, he should be a showman but also unnerving"
I’m not watching it because Willy wonka isn’t played by Jack Sparrow
VERUCA SALT YOU IN THIER?!?
Okay but why does his acting remind of Daniel Thrasher being an absolute g00ber?
What is the point of this movie? We have had two versions of wonka already.

This looks terrible
OMG!I’M GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE! But is this movie comes to Japan?😅
Coming soon...😊
No.

"Not being funny but this reminds me a lot of poorly written school plays. They honestly should have stopped with the original movie but hey, that's Hollywood for you, grasping at straws for movie ideas and subsequently making themselves look bad. They need to stop ruining things with what they think is new and improved as it's just making them look desperate at this point."
Why do I have extremely low expectations
May God bless you awesome and abundantly... May you never no sadness... Bcos you have put smile in many people mouth... Keep blossoming.
"Is kinda sad, in this movie it appears that Wonka is a beacon of progress, anti-bureaucracy & hope. But if it carries on like the original story, he'll be betrayed, close the factory, put people out of work after monopolizing the entire industry & will go crazy....er, until Charlie arrives anyway. It is a hopefull movie with a hopeless end. Kinda neat actually..."

Looks terrible Johnny depp did it the best 🫠😬
0:45 reminds me of Daniel Trasher
"Chalamet doesn’t seem like a great fit, seems like he’s trying to hard to pull it off. Everything and everyone else looks great!"
"I'm not sold.  The original movie was such a draw, imo,  because Gene Wilder was so wackadoodle... he was amazing, mesmerizing.  Timothee is just saying lines.  Not good enough."
"I mean, Paul King is directing this. I'm seeing it just off his name. His Paddington movies were, in the words of my favourite Doctor, fantastic."
Christmas 🤸 will 🤸 be 🤸 good 🤸 this 🤸 year🎉
"I won't lie when I imagine the first willy Wonka or the one from Charlie and the chocolate factory it's hard to imagine them growing up like this and going thru this type of journey, except for the going looking for oompa loompas since he's admitted himself he did it, for that I kinda lost some of the hype I had for this film"
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET GENTLEMEN.......❤
Johnny depp where are you 🥺 someone stole your character and where are the golden tickets for factory tour where are the kids somebody please find them where are the oompa loompas
Come with me and you will see a entire world of the pure imagination
"I wanted to hate on this but once I watched the whole trailer I honestly couldn't.
Congrats Nepo baby no matter who our parents are we still have to have our own talents to get the gigs. Timothee is quite adorable."
Terrible idea for a re-remake. Horrible casting with Tim Chalamet.....he is NO comparison to Johnny Depp when it comes to being quirky and odd and he doesn't have the sincerity of Gene Wilder in the role. The supporting cast is more popular but I dont see that saving the film......Hollywood is TRUELY out of ideas when they resort to putting out this kind of drivel.
"I had my reservations, but this looks so sweet and nice and genuinely fun that I can’t wait now"
"Oh shoot mr bean is in there, say less"
I'm hungry for chocolate now😂😂!
It actually looks delightful
He ain't whimsical bruh 😂😂
This feels like watching myself try to do a Depp Willy Wonka in the mirror 🤢
This finna be hot
Looks pretty good. Please tell me it isn't a musical.
I canKt believe Warner brothers is making the origin of Willy wonka
why do i feel like the comments are fake hahahah
Very excited to see this film!!!
"Wonka is quite deserving of a backstory himself, the man has always been a wonder, makes you want to know his past."
the original song from the first movie is awesome
>blacks
We must be running out of ideas 😂
This would be perfect!
They couldn't cast a real Oompa loompa? In 2023?!?!
"Yep, that’s what happens when you don’t even make him rehearse, and just give him the part?? They really did that !"
OMG HOW MANY TIMES ARE THEY GOING TO REMAKE THIS MOVIE 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
No just no just no
This looks terrible. I’ll pass
"“So shines a good deed in a weary world” - Willy Wonka (1971). They’re bringing the spirit of the first film back, and I’m totally on board."

I’ll have an everlasting jawbreaker. All you need is one.
Might be interesting. To be sure it will be very politically correct.
Слабенько и местами неуместно темно.
This over cringy Barbie anyday
So excited to watch this
I wish it was Charlie and the chocolate factory. A continued story of his own adventure of how he now runs the chocolate factory then have Willy really old but  still advising Charlie.
"I’m so sorry, but I don’t think anything will top Johnny Depps version."
Fortunately between this and the Wikipedia plot review I don’t have to actually watch this film.  If I am going to spend any time in this “cinematic universe” it will be watching Gene.  RIP.
"С Джони депом шедевр, с шаламе кринж"
Nope.
This film looks like a total mess ngl
WHOS WONKING THERE WILLY RIGHT NOW
Timothy has been in some of the greatest movies. I loved little women and I know I'm going to love this one.
"This looks terrible. They should have cast Jeremy Allen as Willy Wonka. Jeremy Allen looks like a younger version of Gene Wilder (the original Willy Wonka), and he's a great actor."
A Waste
2:08
This looks........... terrible.
Johnny Depp is BEST Wonka
"Go Woke Go Broke, this looks like a movie that is trying to hard to be inclusive and destroying one of my childhood favorite movies. FFS stop destroying classics"
"Johnny Depp did it better, but I get it: There is money to be made"
Hollywood quota met ....
some white saviourism complex it looks like but still interesting
AWESOME  !
"For some reason, I like this adaptation. Something magical, Christmasy 🎄 about it. Can't wait"
Am I the only one who feels like someday they should make a Great Glass Elevator movie?
Oh hey another movie nobody asked for. I'm sure the studio will get a fat tax rebate when it flops.
❤
"Missing jhony depp...y 
Y yy ....jhonny is willy wonka...not TC"
Leeeetttts Gooooooo
I love you Timothee
:')
Wonka would not have a black assistant  he didnt in 1971  its improbable
this is going to be so good omg
"And as u said WONKA, Johnny Depp Wonka face came to my mind 😂"
"This looks abysmal.
Roald Dahl must be spinning in his grave.
Hollywood truly is out of ideas."
Merry Christmas Everyone!!!
The fabulous rich fulcher is supposed to be in this somewhere
Timothee chalamet film are the best
125m dollar budget? This is gonna flop so hard and I'm sad about that
Lol the Oompa Loompa was a must 😂
WHAT :0
Dune part three already? it looks more joyful though
"Words cannot express how excited I am for this! Willy Wonka holds holds a very special place in my heart. Even though he isn’t a real, he inspired me to pursue my love of baking and pastry! Cannot wait!"
"Amazing trailer. Cant wait to see it. The only disappointment is the Umpa Lumpa, not for the amazing actor, but i was expecting the classic sqeecky voice and the lovely Umpa Lumpa dwarfism look ❤. Is something that i adore in the original movie and, in my opinion, is what give them sparks (i hope i didn't offend nobody with that comment but i mean it in the best way as possible)"
i cannot wait for dec 15!!!
"I was waiting for the lgbtq moment, I see they’ve learned there lesson on not putting it on the trailer.  I’ll bet money, Willy comes out in this movie."
"Not sure if I have ever been less intrigued to see anything in my life, this looks bad to say the very least."
Everything has to always be so dramatic in these movies. 😂
A wonka origin? Never expected this…
As usual the term diversity is only used for one ethnic group. Why is it always like this in all the movies?!
"I wish the new actor would have done a voice more like Gene Wilder's voice for Willy Wonka, but he's clearly mimicking Johnny Depp's take. What a shame, especially given that they went back to the old Oompah Loompah designs. Gene Wilder's Wonka was more down to earth while still having a wild and unpredictable emotional range when needed. That would have been much better."
"wow ,YES YES"
Can't wait ❤️
"We're gonna get fun and whimsical, that's a must, but I hope we get to see where his DARKNESS comes from too. It makes sense that Johnny Depp would be emotionally abused by his overbearing and unsupportive father Christopher Lee, but I'm not sure I'm seeing THIS Wonka taking people down The Scary Tunnel and threatening the safety of his prepubescent guests.

""Well well well, two naughty, nasty little children gone. Three good, sweet little children left..."""
love it
ada mr beannn
One question. Why?
"This movie is being directed by the people who made pattington and the Harry Potter movie’s, how is this not gonna fail?"
I love how its based before the original charlie and the chocolate factory with gene webber as wonka
Why did the moment he said 'here we go Mama..' bring on some unexpected emotions that I did not see coming? That felt deep 🥺
Im sorry but i hated it when he said “scratch that reverse it.”  How old is this kid?
TIMOTHEE AND WILLY WONKA NO WAYYY!!!
…
But why? Hollywood has truly run out of ideas.
"Well someones got to say it. It really is amazing how many Africans were in Europe in the old days. They were everywhere, policemen, politicians, rich people, etc etc. To bad they couldn't find a vertically challenged person to play the Ooopa Loompa. Honestly, the decay of modern movies is incredible. Thank goodness I am old enough to have lived through the good and bad movies of the past 100 years."
7 years.
Hoooowdy Ho.
Might be pretty good. I got surprised by Oz the Great and Powerful.
When I saw this trailer on tv I knew within the first 10 seconds they would name the movie “Wonka” lol
He looks like Freddie Highmore (who played charlie in 2005 film) in this movie 😍
Tim Tim ain’t no Gene
There’s always that one token character.
*idk still a fan of Johnny depps role as Willy Wonka* 🤷‍♂️
Mr.Bean
"I think this actually looks rather fun and I trust the makers of Paddington implicitly to handle this with care and integrity. That being said, this does feed even more into the idea that Hollywood is absolutely bankrupt of original ideas and creativity."
Hollywood is truly lucky to have him...he born to be a ⭐
"The fact that we get to see Willy Wonka as the child he passed his factory down to before he got old and jaded , Charlie, and not the chocolate cartel man he became is going to be amazing. This is why WIlly passed his factory on to Charlie because he still had the imagination and wonder that he had and lost."
Now we know the secret of Wonka Chocolate's big flavour: the use of melange.
What happened to *Johnny* *Depp* ???
"Wasn't that person that blew like a kiss, The original mom from the remake of Charlie on the chocolate factory?"
"Ohh... an origin story? I do not like the sound of that. Looks like a great cast though and I may see this... Shame they couldn't get a British actor to play Wonka for once, but he certainly looks the part."
So diverse.
For me Johnny Depp wil be the best Willy Wonka🙂
"Well there's certainly the obligatory OTT diversity quota of characters as as expected. I really was expecting a race or gender-swapped Wonka too, it was a surprise to see it wasn't the case - they kept Wonka white and although it's still very obviously diversity check-box driven as far as casting goes, shame - it's going to be orders of magnitude better than if Disney had got hold of it.....I actually might go and see this...MIGHT!

Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is a stroke of genius though."
Ahsoka trailer >this mid
can't wait for this
Alice in Wonderland vibe ❤
Looks awful. The usual false diversity inserted everywhere. Britain did not look like that - nor does it today.
MR BEAN!?
on my birthday yooooo!!!!!
Can't wait!
Uhmm I Guess Hes Harley From Mobile Legends Bang Bang.. 🤣
Why isn’t Johnny playing in it???
"Obvious WOKE casting, and Timothy Chalamet obviously can't play wonka. Looks AWFUL! Will not be paying for this."
Couldn’t they have just left the original alone ?
"naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh...........................................
NO WONKA WITHOUT DEPP MAN."
"Hollywood studios theatrical film releases…remakes, sequels, prequels, reboots. Pumping out garbage over and over again."
Looks very soulless
1:25 why does he look like Carl from the mr beast crew
Ok now the Oompa-Loompa sold it to me
"Allan Johnson for the win, only reason I’ll watch"
"This looks so, so wrong. Timothy may be the perfect Paul Atreides, but he is certainly no Willy Wonka and this trailer does little to convince me that he has the devious charm or naturally playful charisma the role requires. Yeah, Hugh's gonna make an adorable Oompa Loompa and the Paddington films were delightful so maybe I'm wrong. I just thinks it's weird casting for a backstory movie we probably didn't need."
I can see another warner bros flop here
I tought its remake but i think its adventure before won Ka have factory
Another dud from hollywood
who up wonking they willy
Wow really?  Just saturate us with reboots. No creativity anymore.
John depp had the best wonka
"Willy Wonka: So hear me out, what if we employed hundreds of midgets and paid them slave wages in cocoa beans."
"Just what we wanted; another reboot! No,  but really, it looks awful and whoever did this should feel awful."
I just dont feel the latinx community is fairly represented in the movie .
"Michael scott is the true willi wonka, why Timothy is impersonating him ?"
i miss johnny depp 💔
If there’s no blueberry inflation scene. Not interested
does anyone know the soundtrack of the trailer?
"When I first heard of this, I was skeptical, it seemed like a lazy idea/substitute for a Great Glass Elevator movie.

After seeing this trailer, I’m genuinely curious to see this!

Question is, is this supposed to be a prequel to the original book? The Gene Wilder movie? The Johnny Depp movie? Can it possibly work for all 3?"
Wow...this looks so terrible 😂
Waiting for Johnny depp cameo in this movie
hes so cute
to be fair this doesnt look  like the book (not sure) and its more bad than the old movie
Nooooooooooo
0:09
WINKY DINKER AND THE FLINKY DONKER
Daniel thrasher would be the perfect willy wonka
.
Was afraid this was going to be another remake but glad to see them doing a prequel instead. Tbh though not really feeling Timothy C as Wonka but Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa is a stroke of genius lol
This actor is good ngl but in my heart Johnny Depp is the willi wonka
Mr. Bean?
What about Charlie’s grandpa? Or Willy’s dentist dad
Now this is a trailer. You don't know how many times i replayed this xd
"Everything good started with a dream. 
- a certain guy from Austria in the 30s"
"Now we have three Wonkas
Wilder, Depp and Chalamet"
"this look sweet and heartwarming, and silly and smart. hope it's all balanced"
"Brazilian language in my Channel!!!

Em português no meu canal!!! DUBLADO"
Well…at least…the right color…😂
What’s great about this is I can see a sequel already
Willy Woke and the Pandering Factory.
Wow this sucks so bad
Johnny depp was better
hope they make the original  with Jeremy Allen White
I think these kinds of visuals are why we go to the movies
lame…a third remake for diversity…
Unmmm why?????????????????? Why they made another one? 😔😬
Never thought I'd live to see Willy Wonka's backstory.
Hehe
I adore Timothy Chalamet. It's nice to see he's in a lot of diverse roles. Seems like a tear jerker tbh. Can't wait to see it!
Gene Wilder’s embodiment of the true spirit of Wonka will always be my favorite.
they really out here filling that diver quota to the max level
Looks great.
We will be watching
when did they recast the lead role to nic cage?
I love that movie and Paddington Harry Potter is part of Waner Brothers i thing is a yes
"Oh, man, another Willy Wonka tale; the third one. signs that Hollywood can't come up with a new idea. What are you going to stop at number 10 like the Fast and the Furious?"
A film we did not need
garbage
"No hate, but he looks like a Charlie"
is this the prequel of the OG charlie and the chocolate factory?
Chalamet actually lookin like he might knock this out of the park
Blockbuster 🎉🎉
Looks great
"0:19 “I’m makin chocolate uh course” reminds me of Jasper saying “battle scars 😏” in Twilight lmaooooo 💀
This seems cute tho!"
Is this young Johnny Depp's Wonka or Gene Wilder's Wonka?
Опять межрасовые негры ....😢
i hate this even more than i thought i would lol
Everything about it looks perfect except the guy playing Wonka 😂 he seems so unenthusiastic.  I think it will be a nice movie though .
THIS IS SO BAD
"Really don't like Timothee casted as Wonka, I really hope he proves me wrong."
Definitely a better Wonka than Deep played. Deep just came off creepy and weird. T.M. comes off fun and interesting to watch.
This is what happens when you give the lead role of your movie to someone who hasn’t even auditioned for the role
Daniel thrasher
Reminder for December 16th: create WONKA/Dune supercut
"I guess we really are stuck with the same 5 movies, tv shows, and Videogames being recycled every 10 years, forever. Instead of new things"
Didn't Johnny depp played this character not too long ago?
NAHH NOT THE FAKE COMMENTS💀💀💀
"20,000 and 1'th comment"
Pretty sure there wasnt that much diversity in an early 1900s police force.
Why his muse gotta be sum coloured piece??? 😫
How many variations of this are we gonna GET?!
Am I the only one who thinks this looks awful and contrived? And now we are about to be beat over the head with butchered Dahl films? And that the trailer is being flooded with repeated BOT comments?
boys planet fans know ollie is going crazy rn
"I am not sold in this dude as Willy Wonka at all. His acting isn't very good. I don't give a f u c k if you're a fan, just my opinion."
2hour long trailer
It is mrbean at 1:01 and 1:41
I AM SO EXCITED THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR ONCE A GOOD PREQUEL THING
You don't understand how this trailer brought me to tears🥺 The childhood memories... my inner child is overjoyed. Can wait for this to be out😊❤
"""just a small group of ppl defying th laws of physics"""
“How Willy became Wonka.” Great quote!
Definition of uninspiring.
"Paul Atreides is, ""Wonka! The Oompa Loompaz Haderach"""
The director of Paddington ok im in those films were fun.
No.
2 movie was perfect not another remake
A bit too much of a Fantastic Beasts vibe coming from this...ughh 👀
"Lo hermoso que se ve esta película y lo maravilloso que se ve timothée, me llena de emoción"
Another remake….
What about Wonka father
"TIMOTHY WAS CAST WITHOUT AN AUDITION. I hope you all see this so you understand why he is horrible in this depiction. Also, the director passed on Donald Glover for that child in a suit. This universe is no fun"
Does this casting choice mean there have been many many oompa-loompa romantic comedies we have never and will never see?
"From Dune to Wonka.
""The Chocolate must flow""."
This looks horrible
"Not a third willy wonka film FFS, nothing beats the first one!"
"I cant stop watching this trailer. It just warms my heart so much. The visuals, the MUSIC, the magic, and the warmth of timothy chalamets acting. It gives me chills thinking about my childhood and how Gene Wilders willy wonka and the chocolate factory is an timeless movie. This is a family movie we have been waiting for and i cant wait to share it with my family this christmas. Thank you Warner Bros 💜🍫🍭✨️"
"Finally, we can see the slavery recruitment scene of the Oompa Loompas"
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 3.0
1:42 Great to see Rowan Atkinson as a Priest again 😂
"Pure imagination 100%
Golden ticket 100%
Wonka bar 100%
Chocolate 100%

It Must Be Believed To Be Seen!
🏭🎩🎫🍫🍭🍬🍒"
Omg I'm so excited for the movie!!!
Hard pass
"I laughed sooo hard at the Oompa Loompa !!! Now that was great casting. Not sure about the rest of the movie tho. Especially Timothee , he doesn’t have the weird, chaotic energy Gene Wilder had as Wonka or charm. He’s too soft spoken and everything seemed forced and unnatural."
I'm not wasting my time. . .
I have never clicked this fast ever
"I cant see this Willy turning into Gene wilders take, not insane enough"
This has all the energy of the original movie. It actually looks really good.
no.
No. No thank you
"To be honest the trailer was good, but I didn’t think it was necassary to have the Oompa-Loompas look like as they did in the 1971 film. They weren’t described as that, but originally as small, little black-colored pygme people. Edit: Also to mention us that I don’t think it was really necessary to have the prequel follow the Gene Wilder version of Wonka; if that is what they are planning on doing with it. I mean I don’t hate it, but I don’t think neither Felicity Dahl—Roald Dahl’s widow—his children, nor Roald Dahl would appreciate the idea of a prequel. He would most likely disapprove of it, and would be rolling around in his grave to be brutally honest. Johnny Depp at least made it right, with the better script writing, acting, director, and film makers overall were better. If you’re planning on writing a prequel story, or even a book adaptation…then you’d better stick as close to the source material as possible, if even possible, when doing one. But if I may be honest with you all, this movie does has potential in my eyes. I, myself, view myself to be different, while also being diagnosed with autism. I tend to see myself as an eccentric person: with having wild creative ideas—but nowhere as near as Willy Wonka. God, I wish I could be that wildly creative. God would know that."
Let’s gooo Lil mabu’s first movie🎉
"Looks absolutely terrible, Warner Brothers sucks !"
willy wonka is prussian(this is canon)
The actors alone sold me
The oompa loompa's cgi doesn't look too great but I hope at least it has a good story
This will be forgettable.
Mr.Bean!!!
This honestly looks pretty good. Excited to see another movie from the mind of Rhode Dahl.
What a cool trailer bro
"no thank you. good day sir
i said good day to you sir"
I'm appreciative of everyone's positive responses but the first movie was gold. I think we all know by now you can't remake something that was already done perfect.
There should be a horror movie about this
giving me The Greatest Showman vibes based off the music -- but this looks...actually good?!
Do I sense some promotional candy 😅🥺
Watttt
"""if a movie contains black people its woke"" ~ this comment section"
Bro’s turning people into giraffes with his chocolate
"people have a hard on with this guy for some reason, sorry but he's miscast here. wonka is supposed to be nutty and eccentric. that line delivery at the beginning was so forced and cringe"
“scratch that reverse it” nctzens iykyk
"This is setting my expectations so high... It's an origin story... Make it right, make it happen!!!!"
Love Johny Depp
Are we continually going to have a Willy Wonka adaptation every 10-15 years? 😂
"Looks perfect for Christmas. I'm sick of dark, twisted, vampire movies. This looks fun and joyful ... and Timothée is good in everything he does! Can't wait to see this!!❤🍫🍬🍭🎄🎁☃️"
"uuhm, no thank you."
"Okay here's the thing. It's not a cash grab and it's trying to be good. The thing it's doing wrong is that their making the towns folk to goofy. He said ""No daydreaming"" as a law, which is silly but the thing that the original showed us was the compare and contrast from the real world and the chocolate factory. If we can't differentiate which one is more nonsensical then the tone of the movie won't work. Willy's character for the most part looks fine. The only thing he's missing is his cruel sarcasm from the movie. Remember when the German child was drowning and his mother is begging Willy to do something and Willy goes ""Help, police"""
"Why isn’t Willy Wonka black? I thought all rebooted movies are supposed to have the lead character be black now, or a woman. Do we really need another white male led reboot?"
My favourite part was when he said “Its Wonking time!” and wonked his Willy all over the place. An absolutely fantastic movie!!!
A community theater-level impersonation of Gene Wilder - sigh.
Nope.  No.  Looks awful.
Took away the job away from midgets. The only work they could get regularly from Hollywood and replaced it with a CGI guy in a jar lol. Well aint that a waste of money lol. Yet looks like an interesting film
Timothy is a total miscast he’s a horrible Willy Wonka
Good video
No… just no.
I'm getting some Mary Poppins Returns vibes from this.
So : Chocolate + Flubber = Chubber 😂
This looks terrible
"idk if it's just me, but from the looks of the trailer, it looks like timothee chalamet doesn't have the right whimsy/magic for the role 🤷🏻 it looks like it's missing something"
WB needs to advertise more it’s a prequel  NOT a remake bc that is the big complaint. ✌🏻
"This feels like a wholesome take on the franchise. For children and their families to enjoy, it releases 10 days before Christmas, afterall."
"A movie no one asked for and no one will end up seeing! 

Enjoy your losses guys!"
This looks god damn amazing
Willy wonka always seemed a little scary. This gentleman doesnt seem to have that. Ill hold criticism until i see the film
"I was ready to hate it, but left feeling a bit giddy for this instead. Looks like they may have done a good job on this."
AHEIGNBDIRKVBDO!!! I AM SO EXCITED!!!
"Also featuring Kim Kardashian as one of the test subjects for the chocolate that makes you float.
 When trying it, she successfully left the floor, rising into the air, but she also inflated and expanded hugely into all directions, like a giant hot air balloon!
 So then they fixed the formula so people could float with more space around them."
Nice
I didn’t think I’d get to see an third installment of Wonka in my lifetime. I’m 72 years old and I will be watching this film at the theaters!
The chocolate must flow...
Very excited! Are you?
"Haha, I was skeptical to see this until I saw Hugh Grant as oompa loompa... now I need to see it."
"I’ve been avoiding this trailer, but now I’m pretty excited to see this movie 🍿😬"
Awh a main character who reps my last name gang type shi
If Harry Potter Had A Chocolate Story'
I wish gene wilder could have seen this 🥰🥲
there is something weird happening in the comments ! I have seen more than 10 seemingly innocent comments + with explicit profile images + corn !! I think it is intentional as a lot of children and teenagers will be watching this trailer and reading the comments ; please report and watch out !
Leave it alone lol
"It’s goofy but it actually feels like an older movie, like something from my childhood"
Oh god no just no.
I wonder what this one is about 😏
Come on can’t you come up with something new???
Absolute trash.
Oh My! I didn''t know @danielthrasher was playing as the next Willy Wonka!
Sweet Jesus is there no creativity left in the world are people so dull that this is what they want to go see remake after remake after remake after remake after remake? Most of these movies are just formulas lowest common denominator formulas
Omg orange ompaloompas 😮
The trailer's been getting a lot of hate but i think it looks good
"This looks awful and is far from the original books
Another bomb because nobody asked for it"
this looks shockingly OK
1:03 i think the guy is Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean).
"Who's taking bets that this will be a woke remake that trashes the original or its creators effort.
I see the diversity quota,
I see the switching of the oompa loompa and wonka meeting story,
I see it not meshing with the cannon story with the fact he makes people fly in public as well as meeting the oompa loompas before he has his factory(if following the original film the factory was manned by people then later shut down for the oompa loompas to take over).
I have no faith in this at all."
i already know this is going to be so good i cant wait for it to come out i may watch it 100 times when it does come out
"This seems good, but nothing beats the original Willy Wonka movie"
Is this a prequel or a reboot?
"I’m sorry but I like Timothée Chalamet’s acting here, I’m new to Willy Wonka but I like what I see sooo"
Is this wonka’s back story or charlie becoming Willy?
Looks lame like most movies today.
"""Nothing to see here.  Just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity"""
I do not appreciate this at all
Historically accurate as usual
Mr. Carson is going to shut this all down.
But Who Aaked For This?
I bet one of those vials holds the secret to the creation of CW7.
Johnny Depp was such a good Willy Wonka
This is not the right casting for him.
"Sigh, looks like white boy Charlie Bucket has been race and gender swapped. Gee, never saw that coming."
"RIP Gene Wilder.  Makes me appreciate the original SO much more now.  Not eccentric enough, Timothee.   Truth."
So far Timothees Wonka feels like Jared Letos Joker 😬
Use me as a Dislike button
this looks so bad
Looks like it could have been good
might be good
How many times am I gonna see a willy Wonka reboot in my life time? And nobody is gonna beat gene wilder.
Love Actually Reunion with Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson.
Looks like a WOKE remake of one of my favorite movies.
"Wow, his acting in this seems very odd and off and not in a charismatic manic say."
Again!!!??
"December 15?! That's a long way to go. Some of you people will have to respond to my comment after having seen the movie and telling me how it was. It looks like something that will appease my younger child for sure but I don't know if I could watch it and enjoy it. This is a younger Wonka than in that old movie from the 70's, right? In that regard it seems the society got *worse* as Wonka got older! Shouldn't it have been the other way around? Wonder if they bring that up in this movie or the sequel that will come later."
"I see you Key, I see you. Trying to be the most annoying & hateable character, aren't you? Hurrmm"
Here we go mama…
What a colorless movie.  It's so drab.
Audience gonna be 30 year olds mostly 💀
The guy playing Willy wonka is horrible. His acting is garbage. This has potential they just messed up with the main actor. It looks horrible 😢
Was anybody else getting Snowpiercer vibes from this trailer?? Just wondering
In this he seems like a good guy but in the original movie didn't he torture a bunch of kids to death?
More woke remakes (sigh)
"How many remakes must be remade? Can we get something new and original, please. Please. Please."
10 DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS 😭😭
"HUGH GRANT, HUGH GRANT PLEASE!!!!!!! He's gonna steal the movie!!!! I hope he doesn't fk up this moment. a second opportunity, like he did when he first became an idol after Four Weddings and a Funeral."
"First Solo, now this. Why hire a softie to play an outgoing character?"
Wow you can tell right away that Timothee has nailed this role. Great casting!
Who knew young Timmy Tim would play Wonka one day.
Now I want chocolate
"not even a terrible concept, but why timothee chalamet lmao"
ahaa Mr Bean is also here
🤢🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
Needed Liz Hurley in a bikini as the MILF.
Looks STUPID !
That’s crazy
Why is there a kid side kick
Can't wait!
Scar wore it better
"Wow, finally a magical movie that worth to wait for and watch. I think it has been years since we have this kind of magical concept movie. I already love the casts."
SKIP
Why does it have to be what’s his name playing willy wonka I feel like they could’ve done better but hey I’ll take it
Oh dear 😂😂
Very Old World of you Warner Bros
Why did I read that as wanka
"Watch out, Johnny Depp here comes. Oh, never mind.😶‍🌫️"
Are we going to see Johnny Depp again? I hope so.
I don’t have to watch it.
This looks fcking stupid. All the bots are the only ones saying this is good are also stupid.
Looks good. Please don't be woke. Please
Na man johnny depp is the OG
So many stars omg
DID I JUST SAW MR BEAN??? 😭
Looks awful
He's not weird enough and genuine
Was that Rowan Atkinson running away...
Not sure why they needed to make another Willy
not sure i like what i am seeing... i like the idea of it... but some of the acting in the trailer seems a bit too much...
Жопка)
The main character is a terrible terrible actor. This movie looks stupid af
I don’t know in anything else Id be excited for a new plot of a reboot but I kinda wish it was just the original plot with better acting and effects I gotta see 2023 blueberry girl
With a little child the whole time bruhhh
If it’s gonna be a musical i aint watching it
I watched the whole trailer thinking that it was Aaron Taylor Johnson 😂
Let's watch this movie then we could have a conclusion if it's really connected to Snowpiercer... ✌🏻🤣
This looks gayer than cruisin
"Ill be honest, the only one I’ve seen that really made this style of filming (Choose big character that’s backstory is a mystery) somewhat interesting was Alice in Wonderland and Cruella. This is not to say this movie will be bad but I wonder how it’s gonna be. There is already the trope of “random character that is never mentioned in the original story” with the little girl, but perhaps she will be a really good memorable new character if written well. What yall think?"
"You had me at Mr.Bean &Hugh Grant, this looks great!"
"I just feel like SO MUCH is shoved in this trailer I get lost , but hopefully it is a good watch !"
Why is no one talking about Mr. Mosbey being in this movie 😂
Why?  Just Why?  Can Hollywood not come up with any original ideas anymore?
I'm almost a believer...maybe if I watch the trailer one more time!
"Gene Wilder = the best Willy Wonka

Johnny Depp = The exact version of Willy Wonka from the book"
Stop making remakes of already great films. toss off please and make new stuff
This looks fun! Can’t wait to see it
"-Another movie no one asked for (saw enough of Wonka's backstory in the strange Johnny Depp version)
-More forced diversity in a film/time period where it doesn't make sense (1st Wonka had no diversity but suddenly a film that takes place prior it looks like modern day LA? In a time period and location of the world where there was no diversity? Make it make sense)
-Another beloved character that is miscast (I like this actor but you need a very specific type of charisma to replicate Gene Wilder)

No thanks"
Looks way better than that Johnny Depp trainwreck.
Hmm not sure how I feel about it but I’ll give a watch
The original was subtlety dark and this is for children. Kind of bummed tbh. And the timothy kid doesn't quite fit the role
"Every character I've seen Timothée Chalamet play is usually soft-spoken and reserved ... so it's kind of odd to see him in an energetic role like this. At the end of the day, though? It looks like a cute, lighthearted, family-friendly flick that people'll take their kids to during the holidays. Wouldn't be surprised if it ended up doing really well..."
I love Timothy Chalamet but I think this is a big miscast
I like it. It does seem to have that same Roald Dahl Fairytale style.
I like the bit where they gave him an American accent.
Woke Willy Wonka
Woke cast.
it looks okay.
"ITS FANTASTIC,SPECTACULAR AND AMZING MOVIEE IS GOOD❤❤❤!!"
"""Here we go, Mama."" TEARS"
Suddenly there's black people all over Victorian England.  Please stop with the tarring of history.
MR BEAN
Good lord that looks awful.
where’s Johnny Depp?
"This is gonna bomb, another example of not allowing a half decent IP to rip"
"Marcus Lam likes Willy wonka, so he will like this scene. 😂 2:05 Oompa-loompa: Too late. I’ve started dancing now. Once we’ve started, we can’t stop."
"Finally, it is a true classic prequel that is released on Christmas.  Feels like the 90s"
Another insignificant happy story. That's disappointing.
"WOW, OMG, an origin story about Willy Wonka sounds really interesting… I really want to see this movie!😁"
I can not be the only person that just wanted Gene Wilder deep faked as a younger man instead. I mean it's not like they don't have the technology to do it.
"""I'll really enjoy wonkin' my willy to this movie""- someone I know 💀"
what even
"“Scratch that, reverse it” stolen from Jim Carey"
This gave me goosebumps
well obviously if your gonna have a movie about a coco factory your gonna need coco people /s
"You can try and try, but just nothing is gonna touch the version with Gene Wilder"
are...        all of them gonna be hugh grant?!...
"now this is a movie I can look forward to. Movies rarely do that now

I like how they decided to go with the original oompa Loompas"
Gene wilder still the best and always will be.
Looks so good !!
🤢🤮
Awesome. 😊
"This movie will attract all ages from the early movie to the one in the 2000s, A+ Idea!"
Looks like Fantastic Beasts wardrobe at the banks.
Finally a Willie Wanka movie that doesn’t give me the creeps 😂
Gene Wilder ❤
The song reference ❤
The first willy Wonka movie will always be my favorite
Is that the same guy from dune?
"Maybe they used the word ""scratch"" instead of ""strike"" because they don't want to acknowledge the writer strike."
Looks a bit flat and dull. Like how Disney are churning out remakes for profit...even though they're loosing money instead :)
1:02 omg is it mr bean!
@MrBeast made great version
I wanna see this movie in the winter!
Looks Pretty Good Not Gonna Lie 😯
Who up wonking they willy
I’m so excited for this and happy that Timothée is getting a chance to act in a movie like this cause he is SUCH a beautiful actor and really is an all-films type actor so this is amazing for him and Timothée fans (me) 😍
Is this ☝️ better than the ☝️ with Johnny Depp?
folks I am detecting dangerous levels of boyish whimsy in this one
Shows too much in a trailer.
❤️❤️
Did I see the mother from the second Willy Wonka movie?
Love how magical this feels.
"Magic 🪄 chocolate 🍫! 1:08
Until the police 👮🏽‍♂️ chief gained Weight. 1:30"
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE.  trying to mimic the Great Gene Wilder....hahhaa yeah right
Without Johnny depp there is no Pirates & Wonka … 😢
Amazing they have managed to make 3 films out of this story😂
All these new reboots of classics seem to focus on the most boring parts of the entire concept. I don't give a flip who Willy Wonka dated! Tell me more about the Oompa-Loompa-verse or something? Seems like the obvious play considering how huge Minions is. But no I guess it will be fun to watch Willy Wonka apply for a bank loan with his wife....
STOP DOING THIS!
Yeah no
No and no.
"Hear me out, Willy is a wizard just like Harry Potter. Explains the magic candy anyways 😂"
Looks awful!
"why do i feel like ive heard of too many willy wonka reboots in the past 8 years, is that just me or-"
"No, Willy Wonka is set in the normal mundane world, his magic is meaningless if set in Tim Burton magicy world. Just make something original if you wanted to tell this story. This is ChatGTP levels of not understanding the original material."
What about the oompa loompas?
It’s Timothy chamalmala
by the views of this trailer alone. omg. imagine the revenue of warner bros just for this trailer alone.
Why is this movie getting so much hate? It doesn’t even look bad
2:10 The computer animation of the Oompa Loompa body looks SO bad. This is a cartoon character with a human head pasted on top.
This does not add up.
This feels magical! I hope it is ♡😊
I wish Michael Cera was Willy Wonka such a weirdo
I'm sick of kid's movies that are marketed to adults.
NO ONE TOLD ME THIS FILM WAS BEING MADE?!?!???!?!!
Hollywood needs to stop casting timothee chalamet
"Hmm, there's too many Dark Chocolates in this film for my tastes."
He very cute young man
Good to see Timotee Chalamet going into children’s fantasy stories such as Willy Wonka. This may be an interest prequel origins story.
i was skeptical about yet another willy wonka film.. but i think i’m going to watch this.
You’d think that Britain was 1/3 black based on Hollywood movies.
People you can't compare a grown person with their younger self. This is a young Willy Wonka who eventually grows into the Gene Wilder Wonka.
The fabulous Willy Woka !
Needs more black people and mystery meat individuals. I will not be watching!
looks cute
Anyone who’s not a bot doesn’t give a damn about Willy Wonka’s origin story. Have you tried making something new instead of a sequel or would you rather just keep letting AI write your movies?
This looks terrible.
Why make another?
"I'm really hoping that, because of this movie, we see Wonka's name on candy again"
😂😂❤❤
Roald Dahl would be so proud of his work..
Nothing can beat the performance that Johnny Depp brought. Sorry
It would be better if it was Charlie buckets grown up when he took over the factory
Looks terrible
Can we not put Keegan-Michael Key in every second movie?
This looks terrible-  like why is the acting so so so so bad & corny?
I think its gonna fail..I don't why Hollywood keeps making reboots of classics they just ruined one of a past time favorites
"Short answer : No
Long answer : No"
"Can we have a movie without a side character who is diverse or female and is so irrelevant , but just placed there for the sake of it"
"I’m sure it’ll be fun but he’s really not quirky/creepy enough to play Wonka, even if it is meant to be a prequel."
This looks like something that came straight out of a Disney live action film
"You can't say no to a movie with Mr Bean in it, chsnge my mind"
PLEASE! no WOKE !
"This young actor seems to be taking inspiration from the Gene Wilder interpretation rather than Johnny Depp's, I like Depp but Wilder was the definitive Wonka"
Seems more like Johnny Depp's Wonka than Gene Wilder's Wonka...... that is a problem.
I'll pass!! You know why.
the twinkification of willy wonka.
Hip hip... Cheerio
I'll only watch the movie if you sponsor MrBeast
it a leftist plot to brainwash are kids go to texas yall get away from this woke madness
"Ok, this looks better than the clips I saw on TikTok. I was very worried 😅"
"Before covid I was casted as Mr Wonka in a local theater that helps children with disabilities all over ohio. When the virus hit they had to cancel the show, seeing this announcement made me tear up a little bit"
"hollywood really running out of ideas,  the best wonka will always be gene wilder"
MrBeast did it better
"This looks so genuine and magical, love it"
How many times can you remake a movie before you decide it’s time to use your own imagination?
"Could Hollywood please invest in an original and new story, thank you. But nope, lets play it safe boys and remake old movies."
Awesome
I usually don't care too much about acting but this was really bad. He doesn't fit the character at all. And the forced divesity took out any little immersion I had in this.
Only watching this to see Hugh grant Oompa Loompas idc
goat
The “Quiet up listen down” line was delivered so bad but apart from that the movie looks good tbh
I love the pure imagination background … it’s very nostalgic and brings back memories from when I was a wee lad.. I’ll definitely be checking this out ..
This does not look good.
bots comments Warner brothers ok.
pc ships sinks thank god.
"Love that they went prequel and chose to try to bring the whimsy of the original movie vs the insanity of the remake

Love Tim burton and Johnny but I feel they pushed too hard for the odd vs the imagination 

Plus having Mr Bean doing anything in your movie is always a good idea 👍 

Make Gene Wilder proud"
Excuse me but was that Rowan Atkinson!?
"Mr Burns: Have Harry Styles killed!
Smithers: But Sir that isn't...
Mr Burns: Do as I say!"
Here comes another Woke reboot monstrosity to rewrite great childhood classics!
Def excited to see this😊
"It looks good but I don’t see Willy Wonka, I see Timothee Chalamet acting if that makes sense. But he can prove me wrong :)"
"This is brilliant! One note though, the Oompa Loompa CGI really needs work. There's still time; I hope they can fix it."
Its not giving What it is supposed to give lol
This is honestly so exciting!
I saw the actor for mrbean so I’m 100% watching it
Жопка
The reinterpretation of the theme song from the 1971 movie that this is a prequel of almost made tears swell into my eyes when it starts playing at around 1:29 . Saw that movie so many times as a kid. Love it.
"I think he would be the only choice for this role, good job 👍"
Looks like a big steaming pile of WOKE 💩 !!! 😂
This guy cannot act
JOHNSON!
This looks amazing! I can’t wait!
"I swear man, I think ppl give this kid WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH credit for his acting 🎭. I dnt believe him & tbh this looks like straight up trash 😅"
I feel like I would be more interested in it if they did the factory  opening  again  because it would be better
Timothy Chamolets acting is like child in a primary school play
"This is too clean and too twee for Willy Wonka. No dark side. Plus, Wonka doesn't like children, so a load of balls. On the plus side, Hugh Grant will steal every scene, again."
"This kid is the most pushed, untalented, trustfund kid from Hollywood I’ve ever seen. He SUCKS. Should’ve just left it with Depp"
"He has absolutely no personality in this role whatsoever. He looks like he just read the Scripps put the costume on and went out there and just tried to wing it. I’m sorry, but I have never seen Timothée Chalamet this horrible."
who asked for this
Feminism and affirmative action at work with the secondary lead.
Why I hear One Piece trailer? HAHAH😂
I guess you couldn't come up with another movie idea so you just make an already classic movie and ruin it
Depp is better
"""Once we start dancing wr cant stop""

... well not until the child is suctioned, rolled, dropped, or grabbed offscreen"
I’m excited!!
This is the prequel to Charlie and the chocolate factory?
1:49 this little part of the trailer was perfect really gives the larger than life quality
"I'm not feeling this Wonka, the accent & mannerisms might be too American compared to the other actors."
So wonka is in England and a magician? Really?
"When I was about 10 was introduced to the first Willy Wonka original movie. 
In my twenties.. watched the Willy Wonka movie with Johnny Depp. Now.. married.. in my mid-thirties and about 4 months pregnant. I must watch ! ❤"
This looks amazing i can't wait to see it 😊
I’ll be honest. I didn’t think it would be very good. After watching the trailer I am interested in it!
Wow! This looks great! 🎩🎩🎩🍫🍫🍫
❤❤❤❤
"More work drivel, let the boycotts continue, 🖕"
the secret ingredient is crime.
"Honestly the most boring actor I’ve ever seen. 

Tell me one movie he was outstanding. I’ll wait. 

This probably has to be the first he might change his persona"
Lmao all the conservative snowflakes crying at the fact that a film with literal magic has black people (its unrealistic now)
1:41 Rich Fulcher!!!!!!!!
This movie is gonna flop so hard... cant wait to see it tank at the box office.... whoever thought this actor had the chops for this flick needs to be sodomized and fired
Okay legit why does this got so many dislikes? This movie looks really good
Can’t believe they filmed some of this in Eltham..
I think I am about to become a Huge fan of Timothy Chalamet!
"I don't care what actor it is... this looks like dump, and we shouldn't allow hollywood to be so uncreative in all these ""new"" movies..."
Director of Paddington??? I’m in!!!
😆😆
"""Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker"""
Am I the only one who can’t see Timothee as Willy wonka?😅
El único Wonka que vale es el de Jhonny Deep 😤
Charlie and the chocolate factory is the perfect adaptations so an remake would not work
This looks cute! I want to watch this!
I love chocolate.
Who wanted this
"As soon as I heard those ""notes"" I was sold. Finally, WB get it, it would seem."
The production and supporting cast is amazing. The story is funny and a whimsical interpretation of actual drug lords or big Monopoly corporations. Idk how I feel about the main character but hopefully is a pleasant surprise he does well.
"Wow, this look awful!"
"Looks horrible
Might turn out but it looks like it won't"
Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka seems like if the High School football Captain tried to play the wizard in a a school play.
"The film actually seems quite good, though I do think the idea is a little unnecessary...
But what the heck? I'll definitely watch it.
If it's good I'd like them to do two sequels."
this is truly the moment when willy became wonka
Everyone calling this woke has a combined IQ of 12
Another one?!
"Can't wait til Youtuber's make ""Wonka, but every time someone says chocolate.. X happens"" videos."
Mr. Bean as the elevator operator! Nice to see him again.
Awww this actually looks really cute
I have a positive reaction to this.
Odd casting choice for wonka
"They're making a what is it prequel? to Charlie and the Chocolate factory? The story ended how to keep it going? I'm guessing a completely new write. Won't be the same without Jonny Depp, but seems worth a watch. Trailer looks like it's well done."
So is this a prequel of the first willy wonka movie
I'm all in for this.
Wonka e la ragazza di cioccolato
Can't wait for the third installment where he builds the Snowpiercer.
This is stupid.
Where's the part where he builds the Snowpiercer?
"If didn’t get an unwanted origin and an amount of The Glass Elevator with Tim Burton’s film, I’d be more open to to this film."
not bad
"Did I just see hugh grant from notting hill, dance in a glace jar as an oompa loompa"
Wtf
Woke trash although the production value looks good
"the movie is very moving, it's distracting but it's very nice"
We've all watched the original at one point its a classic
"Здорово, что в фильм позвали Пэтерсона Джозефа. Он очень классный❤"
I just have a feeling they will incorporate the LGBTQ community in this movie somehow
Hard pass. Nothing tops the original.
Rowan Atkinson’s “Run away!” is already too ICONICC🤍🤍
Hopefully they stay true to the cannibalism
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Uh oh....
Woke bs lol
cringe
BIG UP LYME REGIS JS DOWN THE ROAD FROM ME . Watched them film this
Gene Wilder... The one and only Willy Wonka! 🎉❤ R.I.P
its WONKA's  timeeee......
I LIKE this.
I just hope its good. These remakes have been rough to sit through at the movie theaters.
"Once we've started , we can't stop 😂"
Mr bean :D
"This is very interesting 
It's interesting to see how the movie is going to turn out once you take a peek at isn't it"
I’ll fight whoever thought it was a good idea to not cast Robert Sheehan as Willy wonka
this looks awful lol
I was expecting to see Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.. but oh well! I'm sure it will be great.
"""Put on a forward roll."""
Amazing casting
Hugh Grant! Where’s Warwick Davis when you need him😄
Ehhh looks too goofy...pass
😴😴😴
Gene Wilder was the best
All I see is another terrible film.
I have serious goosebumps after watching this!! I'm so ready!! 🎉❤
"It’s simple, this does not look good."
Why didn't they hire a little person to be the Umpa Loompa?
"да ладно??? шалмамамате в главной роли еще, круто)"
So is he a young Gene or young Johnny?
"I cried when he yelled ""Adrian !"" at the end"
"Well, this does look interesting. But i still wish the moviemakers woukd stop making remakes sometime soon please. 🙄 but this looks good."
Interesting take on the I.P i like it
It should’ve been Jeremy Allen white 🤦🏻
i am getting the wonka cut tomorrow! yippee!!!!
Last year my school did a Willy Wonka musical and it was honestly one of the best plays I’ve seen by my school (especially since I was backstage in stage crew doing all the props and that stuff). I have a feeling that this movie is going to be a good one and I love that it’s going to come out on my birthday. Definitely gonna watch this as a gift to myself
I love Hugh but damn was that cg beyond distracting
Rowan atkinson ❤
Looks more like a Harry Potter rip off!🤔
Pre prequel must be already in the work. I'll be in the front row with chocolates in hand.
Jonka
Naw
"This doesn’t look totally wretched, so that’s already a bit above what I was expecting."
"Looks stale. Because the original is such a good film, I will watch it, don't seem like I would watch it twice tho"
Is it me or does the lady in the crowd looks like Loreen?
"we're really scraping the barrel now, how much do you bet that boggis, bunce and bean will each get their own films?"
"No...sorry, but I feel so awkward when watching this trailer. The Willy Wonka Jonny Depp played was too classic, and I  just can't help and kept comparing them when watching this trailer... I don't find this Willy Wonka charming or mysterious ... he looks like a 17 who thinks they know everything... 
The Oompa Loompas looks great though! He might be the only reason I want to watch this movie."
"Let's hope this time, a hot, curvy, juicy and malevolous classy woman turns into a blimpy super inflatable blueberry!
 The producers of Harry Potter? Ok, hopefully the props to inflate aunt Marge now can be used for this other hypotetical lady :D
 Chocolate that makes people float? I like to think before it has perfected, the helium in that chocolate also inflated the test subjects like balloons!

  Ok, I'm obsessed with inflating people, but I know I'm not the only one ;-)
 I'm glad they are using oompa loompas closer to the look of the 1971 movie"
❤👏🏿😎I can’t believe how great this is going to be !  My childhood all over again😊
This looks AWFUL!!!
"Ahh yes, Victorian London was known for its high African population"
"Timothee simply does not have the whimsical silliness to play Willy Wonka. He just isn't a silly little man, nor is he a goofy guy."
"This must be a prequel to Tim Burton’s adaptation of the Chocolate Factory.
😌"
This does not look the least bit interesting tbh.
I absolutely hated the movie with Johnny Depp even tho he's my favorite actor but I didn't like anything else in that movie. Hopefully this one is better.
Johnny Depp we miss you 😢
"Well this looks good but it's not Johnny Depp playing it😭😭😭😭I'm sorry but I might not watch it, please don't hate me for that."
Everything about this is wrong and I cannot wait for it to flop.
reallyyyyy omg childhood goosebumps
"I’m out. Looks horrible, and in-endable. It’s will feel like a 4 hr movie in the theater."
did anyone want another Willy Wonka movie?...
Is he gonna kill off children in this one too?
Guess Daniel Thrasher got tired of playing piano
I love that they got the narrator from the Johnny drop movies again
I hate remakes but this one way looks better than a Disney remake!!!... Can't wait to work for this company.
I cant see anyone other than johny depp..childhood fav❤
I just… think it looks bad 😬
i did not have chalamet as wonka on my bingo card this year
This is going to be great!!!
Um again?
"Scratch that, reverse it? I thought it was strike that"
"The previous Willy Wonka's were so good because as kooky and quirky as they were, they had this darkness to them. 
This guy looks so giddy 😭"
We don't need this film! But my god that cast will save it!
"can someone make something original, like why do people pay to rewatch the same thing over and over"
"Whenther you prefer Depp or Wilder's version, I feel like Timothee is perfectly representing both equally. Much appreciated! 🍫❤️"
This looks very bad
The kitkat haderach
"not even gonna finsih the trailer, cringe"
Why?
Looks so bad
Man they really have a checklist which childhood movies they gonna rape and destroy next!
serious miscast tbh. He cant have every role.
warner we want live action of gantz!!!
didn’t realize @danielthrasher was Willy wonka
"My two cents: Gene Wilder left some awfully large shoes to fill, and it won't be easy to do it.  

So far, I feel like Timothy's body language and visual expression of Wonka is spot on, but the voice acting leaves much to be desired.  Take 0:10 for example, where Wonka says ""scratch that, reverse it"" robotically, as if reading from a script.  Contrast this with the original portrayal when he said ""strike that, reverse it"" because he was overflowing with so much excitement that he was fumbling with his words.

Maybe I'm just being nostalgic for the original, but on the other hand I think that every single other character in the trailer has completely nailed it."
Жопка
Is the detail of his father being a dentist going to be shown
nope sorry. looks like a remake that does not follow the original and no longer in the time frame or the vision  of the original.
Seemed like a disaster because of the whole Tom and Jerry thing but this is their director of Paddington so I think this is going to be good
"I don't like how this feels like a disney live action remake. ""how willy became wonka"" is one of the dumbest taglines Ive ever heard"
This is just stupid and it seems I live in a world full of morons
I'm a HUGE fan of the Original Movie. It hated Tim Burtons version... this one... looks really good
"Looks like Johnson's ""last Beamer out of Saigon"" landed him in Wonka World."
"I git the idea , the have the production money.  Looks great though , just what I thought of."
Why is he wonka 😭😭😭
Are they gonna do the bubble gum scene? Are they gonna do the scene where they eat the blueberry gum? Are they gonna are they gonna do the scene that blows you up like a balloon if you chew the blueberry gum? Are they gonna do th
"Are all these comments bots? Tim’s a good actor but every line in this trailer felt forced. Maybe I’m just old and cranky, but Gene Wilder is the pinnacle for the character"
"""Just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity!"" That's something to see buddy😂"
"When I see Timothee Chalamet I see myself back in the 70s wavy hair , thin"
Who had Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa on their bingo card? 🤔
"Hugh Grant: So what am I supposed to be doing?
Casting Director: You are a very small dancing man.
Hugh Grant: Say no more."
I'd actually go see this. I loved the original.
imagine if there’s a multiverse of willy wonka’s 😭 wonka makes a chocolate portal and out comes johnny depp
Just no
willy wonka is my special interest at the moment and i actually really excited to see this😭😭😭
Why are we making a third retelling of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory? Is Hollywood so bankrupt of original and creative content that pumping out remakes every 10-20 years is all thats left?
3 Willy Wonka iterations cus why not
кто пойдёт на жопку ставит лайк
I thought this movie had potential to be like a horror movie. Very disappointing.
Worst. Title. Ever.
Looks awful....complete opposite of what made the original special.
director and producer give me double huh
I KNOW THIS IS A PREQUEL BUT I NEED TO SEE A BLUEBERRY IN THIS MOVIE
Uh oh I’m seeing clues that this is a full blown Musical! They are trying hard to hide it in the trailer but I think this is a musical!
This looks good
"Ahhh, a movie with Rowan Atkinson, this will be great~"
Where did all the black people come from? So if this was BEFORE   the original..... then how did they disappear in the 1971 film? 😂.... another FLOP!
i'm maken chocolate ah course
“The chocolate cartel”🗿🤣
timothy is so freaking awful in this role
The most good looking charming and sweet Wonka ever 😍
Wait... Wasn't his dad a dentist?
*Squeals in delight* OMG Yes! A Willy Wonka Orgin story!
THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOD! the movies thats being recreated arent that bad but this will be so good
corny
"looks fun and cute...  sadly also looks OVERTLY intentional to to promote woke ideology.   if we were not so inundated with such at this point in time..  a movie that promotes out of the box thinking of social things has a place......   a positive value..  like all things though there is a point of diminishing returns though....  which after ""diminishing"" is a point of ""negative"" return.  When things are at a point of over  inundation..... this is  usually means realistically things are in a time of negative returns.   This we certainly are in now.   The woke idialogs are now killing the small gains  they made. Some were not bad ones. Recognizing there is a rare few gender dysphoric youth and adults who need help, and promoting ways to get them that help was a good thing.  taking it to the extreme of we must FORCE the world to cow tow to a tiny sliver of folk ...  was/is irrational."
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa 💀🤣
Hughmpa Loompa
This looks absolutely horrible.
"I came here, expecting it to be another reboot that adds nothing but it’s actually kind of interesting. A young businessman with novel inventions that will drastically change the industry is compelling"
Should have had Ebon from The Bear
Not for me.
This is how you know Hollywood is running out of ideas
Do we really need another wonka film? Who cares about him that much.
The backstory we all needed
How many times are we going to remake the same movie over and over. Did our generation lose all creative and visionary talent?
The Oompa flute tune from the Gene Wilder movie :’) 2:14
Why????!!!!!!!
"🎶Pay the feeeee, and you’ll seeeeee, a fiiiiiilm with no imagination!🎶
🙄😑"
I think Freya is going to be the star of this film but then I'm a bit biased🙂
This looks good I gotta go see this
0:05 lol I'm getting Jurassic world vibes with that soundtrack 😆😆😆🤔
"Hold on yo, he's already perfected that which he was experimenting with way later in life? Lazy."
No No NO NO NO NO !!!!!!!
Looks like absolute shite. Enough with these reboots
Soooo glad to see people aren’t just assuming it’s going to be terrible. This looks amazing to me!!!!! Can’t wait! I think Timothee will do Wonka proud!
the actor line up for this movie looks great !
Nope
Why would you cast someone with no charisma as Willy Wonka???
"It looks ok, from the trailer Timothy chalamet’s acting doesn’t look great"
Dumb
Oh wow... another remake/reboot. Please stop doing this. Please.
He's not charming enough for the role. Nepotism at play again...
This would be the best movie ever and I hope Timothy would sing Pure Imagination like gene wilder
Am I the only one who sees mr bean?
👎
Now they've come for another fond childhood memory. The bastards.
I thought this came out like five years ago lol
"Hard Pass; forced comedy, meta throwbacks to original, fighting against an establishment,  updated version of a classic song that doesn't need changed, dead faced Timothy, origin story.

...It's too generic and overly produced and packaged, like a marvel movie but with Wonka.  Let's ruin another Roald Dahl story with a reimagining.

I'll stick with Gene's slightly mean spirited, but lovable version.


Make original stories instead of trying to profit off of nostalgia."
👎
"Nobody can capture what gene wilder put into that role, all of you thinking that chalamet is doing right by him are wrong, him saying scratch that reverse that just sounds so off to me and not even close to the same as gene"
Charlie and the chocolate factory was one of my all time favourites growing up its nice to see them do an update on how his story started it looks amazing cant wait to see it
I hate hollywood so much
So is this movie bout how willy Wonka started ??
"This is your reminder that Jesus took the punishment that we all deserve so that we could be forgiven and he loves you so much that no matter how far you are away from God he will welcome you with love and open arms if you just believe,trust, repent and love Jesus and remember what he did for us"
I’m a big fan of Willy Wonka movies when I was a kid especially the Tim Burton Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 🏭 ❤
YOU ARE RUINNING MY CHILDHOOD. INSTEAD OF POOR WITE BOY YOU ARE DOING ANOTHER RANDOM BLACK GIRL.
"Bridgerton 2.0.

When they do a remake of Zulu, are they going to cast 1000's of pasty-faced Scotsmen charging over the hill at the Welsh Guards?"
Where is Johnny Depp?
Cringe
yung willy wonka had braces and a helmet fucc is this
Another one... good grief why can't they make something original 😅
So lush and full of whimsical epic greatness. The visuals reminded me of Federico Fellini's films. I hope the story is good.
Back in the day we would’ve called this a tumblr sexyman. We’ve grown. Unfortunately it’s now a tiktok sexyman
man this looks horrible
My grandma always told me that she didn't care what they tell you in school.  Wonka's Chocolate Factory was founded by a black girl.
He cannot match Jonny Depp!
Of course he has to have a black female sidekick because its 2023 🤮
0:42  It's all so tiresome.
"This cast is an odd choice, but fun nonetheless"
WACK
Wait Sally hawkins shee..........my favvv
this is big time! the casts!!!
"Looks like another PC disaster.
White boy morphs into black girl"
"Nothing will surpass the original film with Gene Wilder, Peter Olstrum and Jack Albertson. I'll watch this one, just like i did the one with Johnny Dep, but it's just a remake of a work of art."
Omg is it mrBean
Charlie an the chocolate factory is my favorite movie so please don’t mess this up!!! Why don’t they ever make new movies anymore just remakes
disappointed
Johnny depp has done phenomenal work.. this guy sucks .
"But, we need a special Cameo. If you know what I mean WB."
"Looks like a perfectly anodyne experience. Although Id say that one of the most interesting things about Willy Wonka in the first place was that no one knew much about him. Part of the wonder surrounding his methods and seemingly infinite factory was that he'd just always been there, and never let anyone in. I just wish we could see a new IP in this era of cinema. It seems like every studio from Disney to Warner Brothers making popular movies just uses some classic character or franchise, and just explains away their backstory while removing all mystery from the world and contributing to fatigue."
Garbage prequel
Best thing about this movie - ROWAN ATKINSON!!!!
"This is a masterclass of how NOT to do a trailer, feels like I don’t need to watch this now."
I'll watch this...
ROWAN ATKINSON!!!! ❤❤❤
Looks good but nothing beats the original
"I mean it looks great but it doesent have Johnny depp


Edit: it's not great and is still missing johnny depp"
I can't wait to see how horrible this movie is going to be..
"Had no much doubt for this film until this trailer, it might be another rare case of a prequel being on par  or possibly even better than the previous film"
"All the loyal characters that help Willy build his chocolate empire will soon be fired without cause, and locked out of his factory. Except for the Oompa Loompas, who according to the book, are paid in cocoa beans."
This hits different!!
Finally I waited since I was a kid 🥹
"Wonka or Woke'a ?
Can't trust Hollywood these days."
That’s different
Yep. Watching it.
Timothy wasn't acting here..he was being himself
What’s with all the black people??  There wasn’t any black people in the old c&cf 😢😮
"This looks amazing! I'm glad its going to be a prequel to the original film from 1971, and seeing Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was something I didn't know I needed in my life."
oof Timothy should’ve auditioned
This looks absolutely retarded.
I hope this turns out well. But Gene Wilder is too good as Willy Wonka.
"I have always envisioned my Willy Wonka prequel is being a mix between Pride and prejudice and Arthur Conan Doyle's Lost World. I like the idea of Wonka looking for obscure ingredients in South America and elsewhere and coming back with the oompa loompas which in the original version were meant to be African pygmies. You could place their theoretical tribe in any geographical region and use some type of Agartha inspired explanation for why they haven't been found like the deep caves in China and things like that, but ultimately there was something mysterious and serious and Gene Wilder's performance that people keep straying away from. I would like him to be portrayed with a bit of the madness and zanying us but ultimately closer to a Nikola Tesla type figure whose reaches into various fields of study and invention might have been used for chocolate, but ultimately they're significance is greater. I think his attitude in regard to authority is something similar to Goodwill Hunting when Will is interviewed by the government and he says he wouldn't want to be involved in bombing a building which happened to have a janitor in it with six kids waiting for him at home, etc. He wouldn't want to be an Oppenheimer or have his inventions used for warmongering or greedy pursuits. He's someone who understands the scientific practicality of having to make the magic like a theme park owner, but who's pursuit of ideals is primarily philosophical in nature, and the money is only to fund his dreams reality. I appreciate what they were going for here but I'm sincerely disappointed."
No grandpa joe  off to a good start keep it that way
"The random Rat Race reference is a random Rat Race reference

“RUN AWAY!” 😂"
We are currently in the generation of remakes.. Re-imaginings and sequels that should never have been made. Why not add another one to the list?
Make something new!
"This looks like a parody, are they serious?"
"for some reason i never considered this movie would be for kids, and have the gall to be disappointed"
What?!!! Willy's not black?!  Must not be a Disney Film... Warner Bros must not have fallen into that BS!
Terrible casting
"If it’s woke 
WB will choke"
Sigh.........
My Interstellar boy Tom has becoming a super star 🤟❤️‍🔥
I think i saw Mr. Bean 😢😢😢 again
is anyone else really excited about this bc of timothee
He looks so much like Daniel Thrasher in this when he does the facial expressions HAHAHA
"He's to flat, boring, normal to be Wonka"
It looks fun
Everything seems way too normal for a Wonka movie.
"Theres was pretty much no 'dark chocolate ' in Victorian england, why is there such a hard attempt to convince the young otherwise I wonder? 🤔"
The next movie is his fall from grace to become the crazy guy Gene Wilder plays.
"Lots of diversity for a movie about chocolate.
What is Wonka's vaccination policy? Is it as strong as Hershey's?
No jab, no job. Get vaccinated or boosted today, as they say."
0:25 he did the Mathilda Airlines!!!
Why do they always act like Charlie and the Glass Elevator isn't a thing? I would much rather see that then this fan fiction
"Is the actor who plays willy wonka sight reading, its absurd"
Always wanted a Wonka movie set in Africa!
DANIEL THRASHEERRRRR!!!!!!!!
1:41 Mr Bean 😂
"Anyone else just not find him believable as Wonka? 🤔 I'm a fan of the two willy wonka movies, the original is my favorite. I believe Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka, but I don't really see Chalamet as wonka."
Out of place 'dark chocolate' shoehorned in as per usual and everyone's sick of it.
Looks very harry potter
"Rowan Atkinson in a wonka movie,my life is complete"
A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men...
"Muad'dib is going through a wet phase I see. No matter, Shai-Hulud shall pass this city and cleanse it."
MR. BEAAAAN?! 😭😍
Жопка
This protagonist looks like Harley from Mobile Legends. Hahahaha.
"I love when they use ""the producer from..."" as its such a cop out. I've seen it used before to make you think ""wow it's the same people that did Harry Potter""

Actually no. Not at all. The producer could've done literally next to nothing and your a fan thinking he helped really make the movies, and the reality is no"
Ngl I'm actually really looking forward to this!
Hugh Grant seems fantastic but Timothee Chamalet is not quirky enough to be Willy Wonka
Dark white nutty??💀
Woof
Black girl in early 20th century England? At least 50% is black in terms of the police and the entire population looks roughly that amount as well. Do you know the racial demography of the country during that time period is 99% white? Just stop. It doesn't fit the setting. How embarrassing.
"i don't think chalamet is good enough for this role, same way i feel about his paul atreides, but whatever. rip gene wilder the real wonka."
"movie looks nice, tim ad wonka? not really, matter of fact he looks so out of place here it was so difficult to watch him acting all eccentric and energetic it’s just not him"
Ebey
I hate how they remake this franchise every 10 years. Who is so fascinated with this movie/character. Dumb
Man Wonka is giving Daniel Thrasher vibes. It makes me mourn what could have been. 😢
Yeah you lost me at flying people
This looks terrible
Rowan Atkinsonnnn too???!!!!!!
This is gonna be way better than the little mermaid
Yeah...can't wait to see this one😂
"This Christmas belongs to Timothee. First Dune Part 2, now Wonka..."
"Ummm 😳😦 I don’t know about this movie 🎥😬
Gene Wilder’s portrayal of Wonka is unmatched… but each to their own opinion.
New generation, new Wonka 🤷‍♀️"
Horrible.
Now this feels like a Harry Potter movie haha
Great another silly over animated slap stick movie..sooooo needed..🙄
"Well if the goal is to bankrupt shareholders, good job."
Looks horrible! Loreens music videos is much better!
Politically correct garbage.
This looks terrible.
"Im begging this wont be another cop out and will actually be a good movie for the sake of being a good movie. I also love the policeman design, they look sorta Austrian/Prussian."
"I’d honestly much rather see an adaptation of Great Glass Elevator or Charlie and the Grand Reunion (which, yes, I know is a fan fiction, but it is such a good fan fiction that I think it should get some more love)."
"Timothee's acting seems sort of stiff, no?"
Excited for this! Especially with the same producer as the Harry Potter movies. Bring back the magic 🪄
AKHIRNYA DELFI BANDUNG RILIS FILM TERBARU 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️☝️
WILLY WONKA IS BACK!!!
This guy is in 2 huge movies wtf.
Had no idea what the movie was called but had a hunch of I searched Wonka I'd find my self here.
Rowan Atkinson? I’m 100% watching this
Lame.   No thanks.
Tf they got lil Mabu doing in this?
"I gotta admit-I dunno if I'm weird or just in a weird mood, but this trailer made me laugh multiple times so... I'm interested! 
    I mean come on... chocolate cartel? Hugh grant as an oompa loompa? 
        I gotta ask though... are they gonna reference the tunnel scene?"
"Ohho , great"
"Mr Woke..erh, Mr Wonka!"
"As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version religiously, this put the biggest grin on my face."
"""nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying gravity"" 🤣"
This may be the first movie in history to make 0$ in the box office
Personally would’ve preferred midgets as the oompa loompas
This actually looks good
New Timothee chalamet as willy timothee chalamet as willy Wonka🍫🍫 wonka 2023
Would’ve been nice if Jeremy Allen white got the part of Willy wonka
YESYESYESYESYESSS
HE ISN'T SUPPOSE TO EAT THE CHOCOLATES!! why is he constantly chomping on it!
"Hahaha, Hugh Grant is so funny😅😅😅 the most funny thing I have seen today😅😅😅. Movie will be 1st rate one, I am waiting for Christmas😜😇🥳"
"Uuuugh. No new ideas. Just a re-hash of the same old story - and not a very good one at that. Why don't you just remake Captain Ron or Drop Dead Fred, or perhaps a 17th Rocky movie? Pathetic."
"I first thought that it was Hugh Laurie, not Hugh Grant as the Oompa-Loompa..."
"No, I'm sorry ... They needed a better lead role, he just doesn't seem to fit the part."
"Is it Willy Wonka from the movie ""Charlie's Chocolate Factory""??"
I'll wait for the reviews
Hugh Grand as the Oompa?!?! wtf? why?!?!?!
"I SAW AT LEAST 4 MAJOR BBBLK CHARACTERS IN THIS TRAILER....YET NOT A SINGLE ASN AMERICAN, LTINO AMERICAN, ARAB AMERICAN INDIAN AMERICAN ETC ETC....ITS 2023....THEY NEED TO SET A QOUTA SYSTEM TO INCLUDE ALL AMERICANS....THIS AINT NO BBBLK WHTE COUNTRY AND BBBLKS HAVENT BEEN THE MAJORITY MINORITY SINCE 2000.....ENOUGH OF THIS GARBAGE...

Okay honestly the oompa loompa got me loll
Any horrible histories fans here? 👀
Ollie Wonka
"How you like your chocolate, dark, white....NuTty ?"
Hollywood has no shame whoring out a great idea until noone cares anymore. Like Marvel
I saw Mr. Bean
Michael Scott will always be my Willy Wonka
Something tells me this will be Willy Woka.
COOL! ♥️🕊️
Жопка.
1:41 Rowan Atkinson Evetybodyyyyy😍😍😍
Si no es JOHNNY DEPP no es lo mismo...
Sorry the way he talks isn’t wonka AT ALL…
Oompa Loompas were like so funny in the end
Nothing will ever beat the original but I'll be honest for a prequel in 2023 this could've been alot worse.
Trash. Absolute trash. This is the most I will ever interact with this movie.
"Timothy Chalamet embodies the childness of the character but he’s too young to be Wonka. I’m the book WW travelled and had a ton of stories about his life. I’m the first movie, WW spoke about retirement. I think he may be cute but not right for this role."
Again? Another fkn remake? Just leave this movie alone already
they were filming this near my old house a few months ago!
1:30 What's up with the unrealistic physics simulation?
who up wonkin they willy rn?
No need to hate this new wonka. My generation's wonka was Depp and i liked it a lot when i was a kid and for this new wonka it's for the new generation just like me when i was a kid. For the wonka 1971 wilder fans and for the wonka 2005 depp fans no need to hate this because we are not the main target audience here.
Hughmpa loompa doompity hugh
I don't know how I know it but I KNOW that this movie's gonna be AWESOME.
oh god
"""The suspense is terrible... I hope it will last."""
Why does he sound like number 5 from Umbrella Academy
Looks like a LOT of dark brown colors (and not just the chocolate) in this sure to be woke movie.
Chali and the chocalate factory ..i love it
Im not watching this
"This looks so stupid. I dont know why they feel the need to keep remaking masterpieces and putting a different spin on it. They dont even realize what made wonka a great movie. It wasn't about the chocolate , it had sooo many deeper meanings throughout the movie. Even darker tones. Its meant to be shrouded in mystery. Wonka was a complex character and no one has even gotten close to understanding what made him work. Honestly i would prefer a older charlie story now ready to pass on the factory to another"
Name of the movie sounds like Napoleon
This looks really good!!  I was very skeptical when I first heard about a prequel.
"I love Charlie’s and the chocolate Factory since I could remember as a kid. Even til this day, I have it on VHS."
Am I the only one who thinks that TC lacks the charisma to play Wonka? He seems pretty dull in this.
The second hand embarrassment I feel watching this is immense.
"Sally Hawkins absolutely kills in everything she’s in, I can’t wait for this"
"I like the whimsical feel to the film from the snippet we've seen. I hope it can strike that balance so it doesn't seem too corny. That's really my only concern, otherwise, i think Chalamete will perfectly capture Wonka's kooky nature, which will be the heart of the film. I'm excited!"
Willy wonka willy wonka and his amazing chocolate factory
Since this is a prequel that means Grandpa Joe is bed ridden
love me a magical christmas movie
wish Gene was alive to see this...
I’ve watched this trailer about 20 times I am so excited for this!!!
Would it have killed the lead to try and sound like Gene Wilder? It doesn’t sound like Wonka at all. This will be a pass for me.
I get the feeling this is going to be a lot of eye candy with little substance...like chocolate.
Since when did Wonka become Harry Potter?
Complete with the token black kid. What a dumpster fire.
"There is only one real movie of
Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka"
cool this looks terrible
I better see him do that one thirst trap dance
"Omg, this actually looks so good."
Great movie
"Perfect Xmas film I reckon our whole family will watch all year around for comfort ❤ There aren’t enough new films which are just fun, magical and sincere in its whimsicality"
LETSS GOOOO
Rest in peace to Gene Wilder ✨😭. The one & only Willy Wonka🍫
Not bad different 👌 but still like the johnny depp version
looks forced....
"I’m not sold of this concept, but  the actors and directors are solid, so maybe they can sell it."
No just no.
this looks amazing.
This is the story of Willy Wonka's beginnings...and OMG its going to be good if Sally Hawkins plays his mum !  I adore Sally !!!😍
MR MOSEBY IS MAKING A COMEBACK
"Typically movie trailers showcase all the best bits, without spoiling the movie, to generate as much interest in the movie as possible. I really respect the fact that this trailer does the opposite"
Timothee as Willy is going to be amazing
Жопка)
This kid looks 15 he is not Willy Wonka
this looks so terrible
Thimothee Chalamet is the perfect prequel Wonka to Johnny Depp's Wonka!  I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE!!!!!!!
"I don’t really like the Barbie movie, so I prob won’t like this one"
Should have gone with “how Willy got his Wonka on”
"When I saw it in my feed I was like “No, noooo, look how the massacred my boy”. *But* , after actually watching the trailer, and seeing the directors and producers, I can say that I am pleasantly surprised and actually looking forward to a new movie for the first time in years."
without johnny depp it just wont hit the same...
This looks awful. Why do they keep on remaking movies. Has Hollywood lost all ideas? Comic books and remakes is all they come out with. Hard pass.
"First of all the racism in the comment section is showing👎 how is it 2023 people are still mad about a person of color , also everyone forgets that this is Willy wonka before Willy wonka y’all just want a reason to hate and be miserable"
"Aaahhh charlie and the chocolate factory 🥹🥹🥹
my childhood memory,
i lovedddd that movie i used to wish that one day God give me chance to visit this factory 😅watched it many times when i was a kid... will surely watch this no matter if i am not a kid now 💓"
Willy Wonka X Harry Potter would be a game changer... and explain alot.😂
"HOW THEY ARE GOING TO PUT THAT ACTOR WITH THAT BLACK LEADING, IT IS IMPOSSIBLE. DAMN MOVIE"

Not a fan of the overuse of CG or weird repetitive overcast lighting. Looks like a Disney live action remake
Wow
Oml it said from the director of paddington and Willy’s mom is the mom from paddigton!
I’m hyped for the movie but why did they added this girl in the movie to be willy wonkas friend makes no sense Charlie should be in this movie not some random black girl 💀
I’m happy it’s a prequel and not a remake. It looks cute I’ll check it out!
"Wow! The roles Timothee is getting. He is on his way to become the next Johny depp. 
Hope he doesn’t meet the next amber heard."
ROALD DAHL YOUVE DONE IT AGAIN
Charlie and the chocolate factory + Mr Bean = Perfect combo to re-live my childhood memories 😍😍😍
Roald Dahl is turning in his grave
Kinda bummed it looks like it's not following the original book lore that was shown in the Depp version
I only watch this because of Rowan Atkinson
Bet there wont be no song about getting fat by eating to much chocolate because of all the fatties these days
"Looks great, looking forward to it."
😬
So unfortunate that someone thinks that the 2nd version wasn't enough of a trainwreck and has decided to defile the magic of this story yet again with this mishmash of dry acting and disgraceful plot.
"And willy wonka that i know is jhonny deep :"""
"Usually not a fan of this kind of stuff, but for an origin story this looks pretty interesting with a great cast along with the charm of the first wonka movie I loved while growing up ❤"
Blackwashing. Again
This was never done before. Great freakin idea ;)
"No, nohh, nooo"
Winks is so good he’s made a girl out of chocolate…😂😂😂😂😂
What a dumb idea.
Literally nobody wanted this movie
Mr.Beast THE MOVIE.
Timothy’s Wonka seems… very normal. Not the vibe of Depp’s performance.
As a chocolate lover I see this as an absolute W
"What an utter, and complete *waste* of time, money, and resources. Please tell me, that this is a parody. Little *black* girl: please, Mista Wonka, help us all…LOL!"
My auntie went to the same school as Charlie (2009 FILM) and after the film was realised he was famous in the school
"Honestly this movie and this trailer alone feels so bright, adventurous and magical and i cant wait to watch it in theaters in Christmas!"
What happened to Johnny depp??
Rown Atiknson Scene😮😮
❤so cute
"TIMOTHEE IS SO PERFECT, INCREDIBLE, WONDERFUL, AMAZING AND ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS. HE LOOKS INCREDIBLE AND GORGEOUS IN WILLY WONKA'S ROLE!!!) TIMMY IS MY HUSBAND 💘🛐. I LOVE TIMOTHEE SMMMM 💘💗🛐"
bruh. so many good actors to cast as willy and you decided to choose this one?
He's so cute 😣
"Modern Hollywood: the historical European thing you like, now with quota-filling black people! So cringe."
Yaaaaaaay awesome
This looks pretty good and I’m here to see it out
This is gonna make Mission Impossible bank! Whoo-hooo!!!!!!
Willy Woka. 🤡
kinda sceptic at first but i’m excited to see Timmy do something different!!
Feel in this trailer is more magic in this trailer than in fantastic beasts movies
Bad.
Disney lazyness is astonishing...
Looks good. I got goosies!
"Only one Wonka, and that's Gene Wilder."
I’m looking forward to watching a movie release after a very long time.
"“So shines a good deed in a weary world” - Willy Wonka (1971). They’re bringing the spirit of the first film back, and I’m totally on board."
Too complex 😑😑
As a HUGE FAN of Willy Wonka (From Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp) this trailer LOOKS FANTASTIC!!! A MASSIVE W
NOT HUGH GRANT BEING AN OOMPA LOOMPA IS THE MOST FUNNIEST THING IVE SEEN
Ya no one wants this garbage
Paul Atreides hasn't been the same since his family was killed.
Too many black folks for this time period
I am 100% sure that the vast majority of comments here are paid fakes. Unless all normal human beings started talking exactly like ad agency writers.
0:10
Wow this looks terrible lol
"When i first saw that they were making a new willy wonka movie some years ago, i tought to myself ""yay another same movie just diffrent castings"". But damn its a whole prequal and backstory och willy wonka, and im all for it!"
finally timmy wont be playing himself:)
Bots are the top comments hmmmm
We didn’t ask for another Wonka. We didn’t need another Wonka. And we don’t want another Wonka! Get some new and ORIGINAL ideas! WB STOP ACTING LIKE DISNEY! YOURE BETTER THAN THIS!
Nah
"All that just to end up turning a girl into a blueberry, drowning a kid in chocolate and watching a young girl get attacked by squirrels. The first two are my favorite movies still😂"
yo wonka
"I hate this. Hate, hate, hate, hate, *HATE* this. It feels so aggressively, unrelentingly fake. As if all the money in the world can cover up inauthentic, hollow performances. God, this looks plastic and dead. I wouldn't spend money on this to save my own life."
Another wokeness trash remake/reimagined
Yesssss I'm so excited Holiday season 2023
Missing depp 😅
Definitely GARBAGE!!!!
Aaaaaaa I cannot wait!!!
Hopefully WB and Nestle promotes the Movie with Wonka Bars with a Golden Ticket 🎫 and the winner of the Golden Ticket is a free movie 🍿 ticket to watch Wonka🤓
I love Chalamet as much as the next guy but I can't help but feel like he binged Jim Carrey for 3 weeks straight before filming.
"This seems like a horrible miscast with Timothee Chalamet, feels so forced. Pass."
"Seriously wtf Hollywood, did you read the book?"
I wish Depp made a cameo
"set to 0.25x

go to 0:34

pause every frame"
"Ok, I gotta admit here. I'm interested lol. Origin story of Willy Wonka. This is prob the first movie I didn't want but glad it's coming. Hope it's good with the cast they have."
Make something new
He doesn't seem like the the right type of crazy for the role
Who wonking their willy rn?
"God, this is terrible. Creativity in Hollywood is dead. As an aspiring filmmaker, I’m grateful to be aware of that fact, because that means I can avoid selling my soul to this industry and stick to indie productions. Thanks for showing me why not to take jobs from big studios Hollywood :)"
Something is missing here... but idk what
"Oh look, garbage."
Looks bad
who up wonking they willy rn
😊😊😊😊
Peterson Joseph is going to steal the show. Stick that up your Dojo!
please dont butch this
Gahhh another Willy wonka movie? Gah why must they ruin such a perf-ROWAN ATKINSONS?! Op imma see it!
When I heard about it didn’t really care one way or the other but damn did this trailer show me that I wanna watch this but they put out the trailer way too soon because that tells me they’re gonna be giving away way too much information on it
I wish they’d made a movie of the actual sequel by Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator) instead of this prequel.
NO WAYY MY DREAM IS BECOMING TRUE😭😭😭😭 YAYAYAYAYA
Underwhelming to say the least
This is going to be reeeeaaally bad
BRING BACK JOHNNY 😭
looks woke af
Why they took it so long to do this😭 Thank you for coming!
The thing I liked the most is that they did a great work assigning Timothee as Willy Wonka. ❤❤ Perfect match.
YOOO ROWAN ATKINSONS IN THE FILM!!!!
"Tim is just illegally great in everything he's in.

On the other hand, any writer that unironically uses the line ""I got an idea"" deserved to be fired. Out of the railgun. Into the Betelgeuse."
"Aside from the bit with Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa, the trailer didn't really do much for me."
I really like wonka❤
He sounds like Jessie Eisenberg lol
This looks horrible.
🤮 please stop raping my childhood and ruining everything that used to be good in the world.
This looks horrible
Who thinks that Chalamet is funny?🤦‍♀️
Жопка😂
ÈXCUSE ME WAS THAT MR. BEAN SCREAMING 'RUN AWAY'?!!! 1:41 ????
"Oh no!  Please don’t tell me that in this terrible time of virtue signaling that someone has turned Willie Wonka into a kind and loving person. Spreading good cheer? Changing the world? Have they read the book? Seen the original masterpiece (Wilder)?  Wonka is a self obsessed psychopath. And a darn good one. He has no feelings for anyone. This time of changing great stories into woke garbage, to lift up a group, gender, or race (in spite of the story), will not be remembered well."
"Why does chalamet’s performance seem off in the trailer? Like he is trying too hard to be full of whimsy. Also, gene wilder did this role perfectly, never understood remaking it."
no one can replace Johnny depp willy wonka
looks terrible 2 good 3rd is terrible wjeres the choclate factory
Another desperate unoriginal cash grab from Hollywood that I can't wait to not go see.
Why
I dislike reboots with trendy actors and refurshied stories.
"Girl: why is it so small? 
Me: 2:08"
Now this is a cast 👏
"Johnson, Alan Johnson!"
I don't see any madness in his eyes.
This looks sooo good! and not just because it making me want to eat chocolate 🍫 ❤
Stop trying to remake a masterpiece
I cannot wait 🎉!!!!!!! The original was my favourite childhood movie (with the og oompaloompa song❤) and the remake was fascinating but different. Now a prequel? HEAVEN!!!
His friend is a little girl? weird.
The best part of the trailer us Hugh Grant and he's barely in it
"Honestly... I don't see anything in this trailer to motivate me into spending my time and money on seeing this movie... I guess some parents will take kids, but really don't see this as becoming a big hit 🤨"
Timothée is a great actor loved him in the King movie can't remember the name
Why isn't Wonka black though?
Bad casting the guy playing wonka is too cringe the movie looks fun but he is not pulling it off
Hope when this has first visited  Cinemas etc that it gets released on dvd/blu ray for collectors. This produces more revenue and more jobs and keeps collectors happy.  Some film companies need to wake up and stop just thinking streaming.
🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫
"I never thought we'd be getting a prequel, but here we are! It looks amazing. Im defently gonna watch this when it comes out."
That will remove the bad taste in the mouth left by Tim Burton’s chocolate
I’m glad this is a prequel and not a sequel. Interesting to know how he created that multi billion dollar business😂
But will we see grandpa Joe
"Not sure I like the lead here, but it doesn't look too bad.  At least it's not a Disney movie."
I'd watch 🤣 looks entertaining
rip off of one piece
"Екарная круэлла 2.0
И негры, епт, куда без этого"
What about the Oompa loompas?
Daniel Thrasher is that you😢
Hindenburg
"Бляха, какой корявый закос под Деппа, прям неловко. Абсолютный мискаст"
I uh….I don’t know what to make of this.
No kids so…
I JUST CANT. IT LOOKS LIKE HARRY POTTER
So i guess he didn't want to be a duke and went to the chocolate business
bruh
"Ehhh

Has the 'every third actor' casting problem.

Somehow, the world of Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka became less diverse with time.

Stop it, Hollywood.  Just stop it.  No one cares."
Mr. Bean in the elevator? lol
How long will it take Americans to realise they should probably stop forcing their actors into the stories of other places
"Chalamet is an incredible actor, but he just doesn't have the charisma for this."
who asked for this
Kind a missing Johnny Depp. But love it ❤
"Oh look, another movie where CGI takes roles away from little people!"
"This kid just is not Willy Wonka. Wilder did it perfectly, Depp made it unique and at least succeeded in the wacky aspect. But this? This just feels like “bang average hollywood leading man dressed up as Wonka”."
Feels 😩useless without JD
It’s the kids’ version of Chocolat!
This is really good movie
Part of this is  in Germany
Well I wasn't sure about this one... then Hugh the oompa loompa... 😅
oh no. willy woke-a
Marvelous.  . . Simply marvelous
NOOOO
Pogi nmang Wonka Nayan ❤
WILLY WONKA!
Okay. This should be fun.
"""Mom can we get Harry Potter?"" ""No, we have Harry Potter at home.""  This movie is the Harry Potter they have at home."
My Timmy ❤ he’s so good in everything
Cares
So what is missing imagination
bruh
Can't wait ❤
1:07 anyone else see Mr. Moseby from Zak & Cody or? 😂
"That ""run away thingy"" i so iconic mr beann.."
nice
this looks great!
"I finished watching season two of “The Bear” Jeremy Allen White, could be a perfect Willy Wonka, dude looks like a young Gene Wilder."
"Woke wonka and the cgi oompa loompa
They shouldve convinced peter dinklage to accept the role instead of grant"
Can’t come up with an original idea huh!
What an original story idea! Never heard of it before! I love original ideas!
1:03 Ariana (mr bean) what are you doing here?😂
Overrated actor. This will expose his one dimensional acting.
아시아인은 없는데😮
May be he can bring good quality chocolate to America 😂…
Mr.Bean :))))???
Damn this literally looks like the most unnecessary and annoying thing ever.
Ok. I’m sold. This was not on my radar at all but will be a Xmas holiday must.
"Ahhhhhhh Willy wonky has been my childhood for so long and when I saw this I never wanted to see a movie so bad!! Ugh, I’m so excited for it to come out<3!!"
this is like Oz the story of the wizard not dorothy
did wonka not kidnapped the ompa loompa in the forest and forced them to work for him? lol
I wanted johnny depp to play this
Timothee chalamet  is 🔥🔥🔥.imagine if they had cameo of jhonny depp
Nop
"So, is Willy Wonka a metaphor for chocolate in West Africa, say, in Ivory Coast and Ghana? Because then it would make sense if ""The Chocolate Cartel"" is Cadbury, The Hershey Company, and Nestlé 🙃"
Snowpiercer prequel? Okay
"After Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory majestically acted by Jhonny Depp, any attempt to make something better is just a waste of time. Give us something original!"
"""We have Johnny Depp at home.""

Johnny Depp at home:"
Looks good
garbage hott fuking garbage
Ah yes the obligatory black character where none originally existed.
Generic whimsical nothing trailer for a prequel no one asked for
Omg why
(1:41) can’t wait to see mr bean getting chased by the giraffe! 😂😂
Why is it that in 2005 we can make Bill Nighy look like a practical effect Davy Jones and yet Hugh Grant looks like you made it for a school project 18 years later?
This better tie into snowpiercer  somehow
"I havent seen many of chalamets movies and im not saying hes a bad actor, but i always see him as an actor only in serious roles/tones. Might take me some time and few watch to maybe open up to him as wonka"
"The lead actor doesn't have the charisma to pull of this role, and he and the little girl (who isn't particularly convincing) have no apparent chemistry together. Awesome sets and scenery, but it has the look of a soulless prequel."
Looks so fun definitely gna take the fam
"hmmm... I really don't know What shall I say?

here we are going again.

Johnny depp live as this character
I am cautiously optimistic this could be good
Hes looking like a Carl from Mr. Beast
"Just feels to me like Timothee is really having to act and it is ending up too forced, therefore not working for me. Wilder and Depp whether you liked their versions or not (liked Wilder's, didn't like Depp's) did seem natural and almost effortless. Also the accent doesn't fit for me at all either. Rest of the elements all look good."
"This Wonka comes off like a pedophile, doesn't have natural charm like the others. I don't like him"
"Nobody:
Film industry: Sorry, no new ideas... But what about endless prequels, sequels, remakes and whatever else that nobody did ask for? No? Not what you like? Here you go anyways. Go watch it, we put Timothy Chalamet in it, come on, give us your money.

Nothing against the actors though, Timothy Chalamet is very talented for sure, everybody loves Rowan Atkinson, all fine, but why not give them their own, new roles?"
"Johnny Depp special guest,"
Not even close to the real man 😏😏😏😏
Wonka es Johnny Depp. Dejen de inventar remakes de remakes.
No plz...
Will never watch this movie I don't care it will never be as good as our Johnny Depp!😢💔
I absolutely love how this has the spirit of the 1971 original classic! I even love the whistle tune that the Oompa Loompa does lol. This film looks like it’s going to be magical. Can’t wait to see it!
Rowan Atkinson is here too😭 Now I'm definitely cancelling my christmas gathering so I could watch this on repeat
Ah it's paddington crossed with the original Gene Wilder movie. You got me.
Yay CC
Looks like another flop film lmao
This is no good. They should have cast an English actor
Pretty sure all these positive comments are AI generated. This movie looks awful
Ooof! Casting howler!
"I was one of those people who was adamantly against this because Roald Dahl (the man who wrote “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory”, “The Witches”, “Matilda” & “James and the Giant Peach” just to name a few) didn’t want anymore film adaptations of his work because he was displeased with the adaptations he got to see, especially “Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory” & “The Witches”. 

Growing up, I didn’t know those films were based off his books or that Dahl hated the way they put so much emphasis on Willy Wonka when it was suppose to be Charlie’s story or that in “The Wicthes”, he hated the happy ending where the Witch turned good. 

To me, the film starring Gene Wilder is one of truly untouchable cinema & something I cherish dearly as I do “The Witches”, “Matilda” & “James & the Giant Peach.” Without these films being such treasured memories of my childhood, I would never know who Roald Dahl was. I appreciate that Hollywood sorta-kinda respected his wishes by not making anymore film adaptations of his work in his lifetime but it does bother me a bit that they keep making these films that don’t have the same endings that he wrote.

All that said, I was extremely skeptical about & even wanted to hate this film before I even gave it a chance… until I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. Now, I HAVE to go see the film. Hopefully, they start selling the Wonka Bars again. Those were my favorite chocolate bars besides the Whatchamacallit & the Snickers🍫"
TIMOTHEEEE CHALAMEEEETTTTTTTT AHHHHHHHHHHH
NOT MATT BAYNTON HORRIBLE HISTORIES??? #IlovehimandHorribleHistories❤❤
Never see this coming
Who asked for this
Oh God 😍
Why? Just Why? BOMB!
This looks really good!
Where is Jhonny depp?
Why are there no chinese or asian people in this film? This is racial discrimination
sheeeeeeeeeeeetttt timothee chalamet pa nga
This is part of the Harry Potter universe
"Timothy  is a nice guy, and a versatile actor, but his acting is not convincing to me. There is something feeble in his acting."
"If I do watch this film, I'm only doing it for 2 reasons - I want to see Rowan Atkinson play a bumbling priest again (not seen him in such a role since 2 Weddings and a Funeral) and secondly, Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is absolutely hilarious. 
The rest of the cast, including Chalemet, is a ""meh"" from me currently"
No no no. Woke. CGI fest! Rubbish. Gene is the only Wonka
"Man Timothy's performance looks soo weak... One of the greatest Roald Dahl stories of all time, man I h8 Hollywood looking for a quick $$ payday.... Sigh"
Mr. Bean is in this movie😍
Why is bro look like mabu😭😭😭
i’ve been dying for a prequel to willy wonka since i first watched the movie this was so NEEDED and the choice of actor was on point!😊
RUN AWAY ! my favorite part of this trailer ! im happy to see Mr.Rowan atkinson.
Huge Depp fan here and I was a little iffy about this one when I heard about it because a JD role is gigantic shoes to fill but after seeing the trailer I think TC might just pull it off! Willy Wonka is one of my favorite childhood movies so I really hope it lives up to the hype of the trailer!! I can't wait!
Is that… Johnson?
Why didnt they cast Tom holland as Willy while they are on it
Johnson! IFYKYK
Всем привет 🙋‍♀️ с вами «Жопка»
Wooohooo woke wonka !! Can't wait to miss it!
😐
Shout out st albans where this was shot (some of it)
"Oh great an annoying youngster willy wonka. There's never going to be another Willy Wonka, Willy Wonka was Gene Wilder. No one's going to compare to his willy wonka so don't even bother. 

Also what's with all the darkness and brown? Did they forget that one of the major things that made the original so good was how nice and colorful it looked? The people who made this are absolute buffoons and should be embarrassed."
Hmm idk I really don’t see TC as Wonka. There was something special about the original movie and in the second one Depp was astounding. Depp had the right mix of intelligence and strangeness. Some mystery about him and at times he could still be creepy and innocent. As for Oompa Loompa the short Indian man who played that role did fantastic too. I used to actually find him scary and odd. This trailer just doesn’t quite hit it but hopefully the movie is better.
"You know we have come to a place where there is a lack of new and exciting movie content, when producers start making prequels.  IMHO nothing beats the original...."
"Who don't watch a movie that Rowan Atkinson is in AKA MR. BEAN?
😊😊😊😊"
This man couldn’t act decently if his life depended on it.
"Music by Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy, yes!!"
Wonka ISNT a psychopath? Wtf was Gene Wilder doing that whole time?
What’s a monumentally stupid looking film.
Aaaaaaaaa! GOOSEBUMPS!!!!
the forced diversity destroys every movie honestly
"How can the prequel be this ‘diverse’… So annoying, not staying true to what followed’…I won’t be able to watch it"
Chocolate cartel? Have some respect for your audience.
Shish
"Mr Bean is the priest in this film, can't wait for this classic"
can we have Panic! At the Disco on the soundtrack please? 😢
Naaaa.. he not comedic enough to be as witty.
"Well, they sure checked the diversity box, didn't they? This looks thoroughly MEH."
"Can’t wait to see this!!
2:18 “Too late, I started dancing now.” 😂"
"I'm a simple man, I've seen Mr.Bean, I'm gonna watch the movie!"
Looks good tbh but... WHY IS HE AMERICAN😭
"so bad, careless"
Mr Wonka should definitely have used the Voice over the Chocolate cartel.
"Apart from Rowan being in this, the trailer didn’t do anything for me, he didn’t sell me as being Wonka and idk why they would do a prequel to the original movie and 1970’s Oompa Loompas and not the 2005 version?"
I don't think chalamet is right for this role.
Noo they ruined the style of the first to willy wonkas
Жопка
Congrats Daniel Trasher for the main role 😁
Timothée Chalamet is soo FINE!
You think Roald Dahl would have accepted made up prequels and sequels of his famous story's?
looks extremely stupidly woke
"Two things. Hollywood blatantly sticking the odd black actor in a supporting role here and there just looks like wokeness, box ticking. Unfortunately theae actors do not represent the rest of globes ethnicities such as Latinos, Asians, Arabs. Secondly, you simply can't follow Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp - and if you try then you gotta get it right. From these clips, it doesn't look like a good representation of the Wonka character"
"it feels like if Johnny Depp or Jim Carrey where 3 decades younger, either of them would be the perfect cast to play Willy Wonka"
"This is the over exposure of Timothy Chalamet.  Frankly, I am tired of seeing him in films and film series, back-to-back."
once we dance we can't stop 😂
Mr bean 💪
They had me at chocolate.
You had my curiosity. But now you have my attention.
Chalamet's most renound roles were very moody and somber performances. He's just not right for this part and having him play against type isn't looking like it's going to pay off for this movie
слишком много шоколада
"This is the movie to be excited for, not effin Barbie."
That's like 3 days before my birthday
Are the oompa loompas going to twerk in this movie also?
This feels more like genes wonka and I love that
There’s mr. freaking Bean 😮
Where is Willy Wonka i know who is actually a dark and snarky sociopath in a borderline creepy murderous movie disguised as a tale for kids? Who is this wonky happy child and what is this syrupy disney movie?
Ahh just before Christmas…. Wonderful 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
"Looks horrible! They need to stop rebooting and remaking, come up with something original. There's no creativeness or imagination anymore."
"Are we going to see Jhonny Depp as the older Willy?
I would just love to even it's for a small moment.."
Why is Hugh Grant giving major Lord Farquaad energy?
He is handsome
yikes
жопка
I'm sorry but I have no clue why they cast Timothee Chalamet for this role
No. This will flop. Sorry.
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
Warner Bros may want to check out a library sometime and find a story worth adapting then making another origin story no one asked for.
"gene wilder was Mr.Wonka. Everybody thought johnny depp couldn’t pull it off, he became Willy Wonka.  I don’t know how i feel about timothy, haven’t seen the movie i just don’t feel willy, or mr.wonka from him."
OMG. This is a must see
i DONT WANT TO SEE LIZARD BOY AGAIN HE'S BAD HE'S NO GOOD
"Well.. that does not look very good.. and the guy isn’t throwing off Wonka vibes at all, very generic acting it seems"
Why did we need this third reboot?
Ouuuu yesss !!
Willy Wonka - a mean slave driver who murder kids openly infront of their parents.
I love Chalamet. But I gotta say this feels like a mismatch.
Timothy Chalamet was not the right actor for this. he just sounds like himself and not the willy wonka character.
Thank god disney would have ruined this project.
Жопка.
Pass.
"This looks good, whimsical and it doesn't have the racism of the original novel which is a major plus."
"please stop casting T.C. in movies, this kid is Vanilla AF."
you guys need to remember that with depp it was a darker adaptation of the original. stop comparing it bc they are different adaptations
"the trailer looks really promising, looking forward to it

BUT DECEMBER IS STILL SO FAR AWAY :("
Wonder what that movie would have been like without political correctness.
Cant wait to watch bruh ❤❤❤❤❤
"Not saying that Timothee is a bad actor. But to compare his portrayal of Willy Wonka to that of Depp’s, makes me realise how uniquely talented Johny Depp was."
Not the same without johnny depp
The Film Industry is dead.....
1:44 The balloons reminded me of Up(2009). 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🏠🌴🌴🌴🌴🌴👴🏻👦🏻🐕🐕🐕🐕🐕🦚🛩️🎥🎥🎥🎥🎥
Willy Woke-a and the Factory of Color
We need Johnny Depp!
"wow, this is really refreshing seeing the other side of Timothee Chalamet in the prequel of Depp's Wonka, cant wait!!"
i was hoping i could see depp as cameo on this movie.
Gonna be good
Im sorry timmy is overrated
I love it ❤
I was very discussed of all the recent years of stupid movies and to me doubting eyes came this movie trailer... That looks very good - to be fair very very good. I will defo go to see it to theatre.
How many times is Hollywood going to beat a dead horse.

1:50 Is that Loreen?
Anybody else expecting Hugh Grant to be oompa loompas??😂
"Although Johnny Depp is my most favourite Willy Wonka and he'll have this title forever, i'll watch this movie surely it seems really good and funny."
confio en timmy
This looks f*cking sick!!!
Uhmm.. Why is this not horror??? 😠 Willy Wonka is not this nice..
"mr bean, :) anyway i was like.. oh god not choclate factory the 2 before were amazing dont need a third one.. but thank god this is about the beginning"
Going to watch this only for ROWAN ATKINSON 😭
cant wait to see this movie!
The Michael Gary Scott biopic/prequel he always wanted
I’m sorry but he’s not delulu enough
"This seems really magical but idk...wonka doesn't seem to have that ""fantastical whimsical magical absolutely insanely crazy"" vibe to him. He should be the previous wonkas turned up 100,000 thousand as this seems to be Wonka's backstory and startinh so his passion should be amplified by his youth but I'm not an expert so this is just my opinion"
Cautiously optimistic for this one. But I've been burnt by so many reboots/remakes/prequels/sequels. Please be good.
Looks boring
Looks horrible…..
I guess only rubbish can be made these days
I can't believe it that's like the first Willy Wonka prequel film to the original Willy Wonka film and pretty much it's awesome they really made a movie based off on the origin story how Willy Wonka made chocolate and candy and pretty much I can't wait to go see this in theaters in December it looks really interesting
Congrats @Daniel Thrasher 😂
this is the most deeply uncynical thing I've seen in a while and I'm living for it
I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE
It's a great year (yet again) for Timothee Chalamet. Dune 2 coming in November and Wonka in December.
I don’t think I’ve ever been so excited to see a film in my life
I see WOKE
Well most of the cast are British. And some are American. But when it comes to British they are good of acting.
You ruined it with the black
I have started dancing now and once I have started i can't stop.. awesome
I love the Oompa Loompa scene so much ✊😭💯
im not going to watch it
I am not missing this by any chance. So so so happy it popped up out of nowhere and I am surprised and excited and so much. ❤😭😭😭
"I like that their doing a pre-wonka before the chocolate factory, thank god its not just another reboot of the same story"
Wo ist Johnny Depp ?!!!!
Is that Rowan Atkinson?
"We need Rowan Atkinson to reprieve his role in Wonka deriving from his scene in Love, Actually."
I LIKE HUGH GRANT AS THE OOMPA LOOMPA!!
omg i cant wait!!
goto watch is fine acting and sensely entising movie 🍿
Another mkultra trigger.
OMG THIS TRAILER IS THE TRAILER OF THE YEAR ITHEJSS
Who is ready to gain some pounds?
"the first 20 seconds disappointment, the next 20 seconds better, then up to high grant..impressed after seeing the oompa loompa, I'm excited to see it"
It was such a smart idea to make TC take the role of Willy Wonka in the movie
"Wow, there's something so magical about the look of this movie! Consider me, a grown man, sold on!"
Looks good for the kids. Should’ve just filmed it where the original was filmed in Germany and went for a similar look rather than the Harry Potteresque look this has.
I def did not see timothee playing this role but ok
He's no Gene Wilder.
all ready dont like it to be honest
"“I’m something of a magician”

"Wonka's appearance looks like he was inspired by Tim Burton.

Just to avoid making the character look like Gene Wilder because of Hollywood's irrational hatred towards gingers."
"Looks like this was made mainly in the UK rather than in Hollyweird. Quite a different feel to it, with refreshingly subdued ESG…"
Looks terrible
I know nothing of whos playing willy wonka but I definetly dont like how he reads the script or just how his movements are
🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑🗑
Rowan Atkinson spotted 🔥
Wow
i love it already
yay
❤
"man, i'm so willy

how Willy... 🍆"
Mr carson retired from downtown abbey to work here😂
Well here’s my dads childhood all over again
"I would be more optimistic about this if they had a different lead actor, Timothee just feels very miscast. His line reads just feel off. Someone like Paul Dano probably would have fit better."
Another Wonka?  No.
This actually looks good!!!
"actual best trailer i have seen, i literally shed tears like this is a must watch for me"
Does anyone else think this is gonna be a terrible movie?
This looks fun 😀
ROWAAAAAN❤️
"I don't know. I loved the original. Truly marvellous movie. I was hoping this would inspire me more, but I simply didn't find it captured me at all. Hugh made it at least a little funny, even if the CGI is a bit obvious and he came off looking like a head superimposed on a graphic.
I guess I'm a little disappointed."
Жопка
Timothée Chalamet's portrayal of Wonka is like a perfect fusion of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp.
Kinda getting tired of the remakes... Is it just me?
Oh
I love Willy Wonka
"are most of the comments bots? Timothee's acting is really really bad. I agree with others here, his range for this role is not there. I am not seeing a young version of anything. The facial expressions, and accents, are so inconsistent and subpar."
"Это Жопка, а не Вонка)"
"Feels kinda pointless for Willy wonka backstory, it was kind of the point that we knew little about him. I know what burton did, however that bit of the movie was actually a homage to his personal life and actual relationship with his parents. But I digress, I don’t think this movie will be bad, just kinda pointless, rehashing iconic characters in ways that feels manipulative and lazy. But still, I doubt this movie will be bad."

WOOOOO!!!! Another banger!
This movie looks so insane and I love it!!
This is how you revisit a classic and it’s magic without remaking it. Disney take notes
Rowan Atkinson in the houuuseee😭🤍
"Okay, I'm finally going to theatres! So excited, something worth watching after a long time"
This looks like a magical good time. Has that Classic WB Movie Feel. I love it
Am i the only one expecting a Johnny Depp-Wonka-vibe in here?
Johnny Depp ❤
this is what casting off status over ability turns into. timothee has no range and he can’t even keep his accent straight 🙃
"Timothee Chalamet's delivery as Wonka isn't promising.
He doesn't have the confident nonchalance of Wilder's Wonka, or the barely-contained insanity of Depp's.
Every line he has in this trailer has an air of... timidity? He doesn't seem to be comfortable with his own presence on stage, in stark contrast to Wilder and Depp, who both strut around like own the place.

Chalmet was extremely well cast in Dune. Paul is an earnest young adult thrust into the heart of conflict with little confidence in his own ability, and Timothee brings that energy.
Trouble is, he seems to be bringing the same energy here, to a character who is well established as a cocky, eccentric misanthrope.
He'd be better cast as Charlie than Willy Wonka.

Unless this film can effectively show Wonka's descent into impassioned madness and Chalamet can bring that to his character, I don't see this movie going anywhere."

the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory (1971) is one of my favorite movies💚💚🌿  I'm curious.  what is presented to us 🙏🏽 (although I hate musicals in films)
Make something original would you
So it’s linking back to the Gene Wilder interpretation of Charlie and the Chocolate factory… Im generally not that drawn towards Timothy Chalamet bc his characters tend to give off the same brooding moody vibe so I’m interested in seeing him a role that intentionally goes against that
At least it's not like the last one they made with Johnny Depp that one gave off a lot of pedo vibes.
"Roses are red
violets are blue

"Looks catastrophic. All of the magic of the original Roald Dahl book is completely absent, and we are left with a harmless parody that looks completely boring. Everything feels wrong."
"I loved the original Willy Wonka. Watched it more times than I can remember growing up.

This movie looks terrible. Totally not even in the spirit of the original.

The *last* thing I want is to have Willy Wonka ruined by finding out his backstory.

*He's not the main character of the story.* Tell me more about Charlie."
"good looking movie and all, but how many reruns does this movie really need?"
Please fix the closed captions?

"New headcanon: 

Willy Wonka, Mary Poppins and Nanny McPhee are all related. Cousins? Half-siblings? But definitely related."
No one can replaced Jhonny depp
Meh. Looks corny. I will stick to the original fo sho.
Again???? Something new???
going to relive my childhood with this prequel
The got the perfect person to play Willy Wonka
whhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I saw mr.been 1:41
Willy Wonka was Jewish not some rich white boy
Yea I'm sorry I'm not debating that it could potentially be a very good movie but Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder as professors are just going to be hard to come close to
Looks More like the mad hatter From alice
Hm…prequel. Might be interesting. I like Tim (mostly cos he’s attractive) but that’s arguably what makes him less wonka here.
"Bruuuh, shame"
i’m so excited to watch this film !
WONKA is perfect Christmas time movie. Easter too.
So this is The time before he became a pedophile.
Garbage fan service movie.
TC as wonka is weird
Awww … I saw the info I this …It felt like a Harry Potter-inspired movie ❤
In my opinion he does not fit the role. Just not goofy or witty enough. He just seems basic.
Whoohoo Woke Diversity. YESSSSSSS. We needed that.
Johnny Depp is still my legendary actor
Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompah is perfect! I cannot wait for this film
"What the hwll is everybody here on about. The whimsical nature looks too forced, particularly in the acting. The film looks mid. Which is such a shame, i wanna see a novie about a whimsical guy moving into town. Why is Wonka even a protagonist he works so much better as a secondary character."
"Tbh this looks meh. Like a Disney movie. If you’re gonna prequel, at least have the decency to keep Gene Wilder’s dry humor alive. Theres barely an ounce of it in there."
Can't wait!!!
I can't stand diversity hiring. I'm out.  👀
bro why is charlie a black girl? movie looks woke asf. more like willy wokea
"Warner Brothers, can we please have some more IP with that CU?"
Good Wonka
"опять негры в городах, где их не было... как вы задолбали!"
When I first saw Timothée on the cover I was really skeptical on how it would turn out but now that I see the trailer it actually looks really good and I’m excited to see it.
Why they got TC as willy wonka 💀what on earth has happened to casting directors doing their jobs
Yeah no I think I'm just old now  ....looks like it sucks 🤷🏾‍♂️
Grandpa Joe get a Cameo? 😮
👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻✨
where the trophy Asian person in this film??????
Oh my god another one
"Even if it's minor role, it's always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films. Can't wait to see this one, the film captures the spirit of the source material so well ❤"
For a second I thought it's Ibrahim
Why are they always exploring his past? Why is there even another movie? Why are people definitely going to watch this?
Mr Beannn ahaha
"The main lead is good. But by the voice, action and other stuff...it strongly remainds me of Jesse Eisenberg(played lex Luther, zombieland, now u see me, social network)

Any one thought of the same?"
Hm. Not impressed.
Tamil dubbed plz
what an abomination of a movie
Just perfect👌🏻👍🏻
At this point they be reusing the Paddington actors. At least they're doing one of the three Rs.
Looks mid but it’s got Matt bayton sooooo
"The humor and acting already seems stupid in the trailer, I fear that the movie won't do that great, and a lot of people will definitely be disappointed."
Well it's obviously a nod to the Gene Wilder Wonka film which is pretty dope
"Jesus, not another reboot, there already was one."

this acting is unbelievably embarrassing
This is awful. Johnny Depp Wonka was the best. This is just pure cringe !
So this is the prequel?
he looks 17 - so he spent 7 years ?
Timothee Chalamet is this new generation's Leonardo DiCaprio.He got a lots of good roles.
wow
Aahhh this year gonna be something magical ❤
This might be great or it might be terrible but probably it’ll be just meh
Can’t wait for this! ❤
This is so soulless and the main actor has as much emotion as a plank of wood.
"Hang about hang about, where is this going Ethan? It's just a movie innit mate?"
wilder was way better -
Why does timothèe chalamet look like lil mabu
this actor compared to Wilder is a huge disappointment for this role 😮
"It's look like a good film,the sweets that make you fly he was making when Charlie turned up later,
And Hugh very funny,I am sure this will smash the box office,
I am glad this is before Charlie as I was thinking they would make him a girl or black which he is not neither"
This is gonna be bad.
"This looks absolutely terrible.  Even if it didn't, the whole point of Wonka's character is that he has a mysterious past.   A prequel ruins the mystique of the character."
I was a child used to love Willy Wonka and Charlie and the chocolate Is term 4 school I learn about Charlie and the chocolate factory about characters study and about Augustus gloop then I watch movie in the school❤ for last year
"I'm keen on Woke Wonka, but why aren't the oompa loompas black? CM'ON MAN"
This looks awful
Oh ‘em gee yeaauus and around Christmas!!!
I can’t wait to see the TikTok guy in the bush cut into the film by accident lol 😂
gee can no one come up with an original movie anymore...
It’s weird to me that no one is talking about how terrible TC seemed in this trailer. Not fit for this role at all it seems other than that looks ok.
im gonna watch this movie because mr bean has become a father now
Eh. Dialogue is cheesy. And Timothee is annoying. People must be desperate for a nostalgia film
Türkiyeye ne zaman gelir🎉
This looks horrible!
Wow This Looks Mmmmm Good! 😋
No thanks....
Yes its a cartel chocolate
Looks absolutely dreadful
"Whenever i hear willy wonka, Johnny depp always comes to my mind. No offense tp the guy playing that role now and i can see he's doin a pretty good job but johnny was the best actor for that role still."
Looks fun.
❤
1:03 Mr.BEAN
Gene Wilder was the one and only Willy Wonka..period! Bored a** Hollywood just isn't creative anymore smmfh

I always want to know how wonka life began .It like a whole new chapter where he make good chocolate for people who love his chocolate  and  make a 😂 that how you you know it good chocolate
Cant wait 🥰🥰🥰🔥
Hey thats Keegan from Key and Peele as the police officer!
Nice trailer excited
the movie i wasn't expecting tbh but then again there's already at least two others so why not
I smell a Stinkeroo(tm)
seeing wonka as such a young person throws me off because all of the other movies hes older
Its a 0 in tha comparison  to johnny depp movie
"Nah, Willy Wonka will forever be represented by Gene Wilder, in memoriam."
Very interesting!
Are they going to just wave alway his slave force?
Wonka Atreides
"Okay, Wilder and Depp, as someone in the comments has noted, had an edge. They both had that captivating edge about them, revolving around Wilders mistrust, and Depps upbringing, it made them not only captivating, but mysterious and “unpredictable” in a way. Timothee in this movie, does not have that. A lot of people see it as a casting issue, but in reality, this might be a character writing issue. The movie could’ve still been PG and released on Christmas, but they could’ve added an edge. I know the term “edge” is broad but that’s all Willy Wonka really needs. Yes Timothee is playing “the character as intended” and i guess so is the script, but let’s be real, did a majority of us watching really feel captivated and interested in Wonka watching this trailer? Me personally, watching this trailer just made me want to watch the older versions again. I’m no expert on Willy Wonka by any means so take this with a grain of salt, but it seems that they’ve had all the time in the world to make this prequel, over a decade, and they could’ve done something really great with it, potentially even groundbreaking for a pg movie, everyone that watched the old ones, if this trailer had the it factor, would go watch this. It could’ve even been up there for movie of the year, i mean the potential is unmatched, and im just a little disappointed. Maybe i’ll eat my words, maybe i won’t, if you read this far, there was probably no need lol"
Use me as a DISLKIE button
Anything made by Liberals / Democrarats will always be titled: DUMB...👍🏼
I don’t think the main actor is suitable to play the role of young willy wonka. Johnny acting was a whole new level.
Just stop and do something original I beg of you
I’m surprised they didn’t make wokna black and female.
Wonka : Chocolate Beast and where to find them
only in theaters!? gotta wait for hbo for another one or two yrs :<<
Где все русские с комментарием про Жопку?))
This looks awful Jesus
nah
Nice 😊
he's really the Lisan Al-Ghaib
Ommpa looompa was missing
Who's up wonking their willy rn
SUPERRRRBBBBBBB I CAN’T WAIT 🥹😫
"Woww😃,super cool🤤,I like it,thanks🍫🍫🥰"
This looks cool! I'm definitely looking forward to it!
This movie is my childhood I'm definitely going to go see this I seen the original then the remake now this one is going to be epic🎉
Wow...pass.
"This kid doesn’t have the chops to pull off Willy Wonka, Gene Wilder, And Depp had the acting abilities, this kid might do better as a Ken in the Barbie Movie."
"There's something different about this , it kind of exubarates hope and happiness . Its rare nowadays 😅"
This looks horrible.
A prequel to the 1970s Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory. Cant wait
This is surprisingly amazing
HATE
It looks like an SNL sketch
Well no one is saying it....... it looks like a disaster waiting to happen. Could not even finish the trailer it was so cringy
Timothy chalamet as Willy Wonka is a definite good casting call!
I'm just glad I'm old enough to remember when films were good. Hollywood is 100% stuck in a post creative age at this point.
MAJOR cinematic risk and shoes to fill with Gene Wilder AND Johnny Depp... Cant wait to see how and if the challenge was properly met....😮
"he's cute, but he's emotionless"
"If you’re gonna remake this movie again, you should put Johnny Depp in it. This looks stupid."
Paddington & Harry Potter? How can this be anything but magic!!
"A retarded actor 
Woke casting 
DOA"
If it's Willy Wonka.... then YES!!!   If it's going to be Willy Woke-a... then... yeah.   Take a pass on that.
He's like a mixture of gene wilder and johnny depp's ver of willy wonka
"The origin of willy Wonka, that something im interested in seeing. Expansions into classic stories are far better than low effort remakes"
"ughhhhhh arghhhhhhhh noooooooooooooo.
Suddenly the johhny depp one doesnt look so bad.
1. Only gene wilder can be Willy Wonka, no one else knows how.
2. Replacing charlie bucket for some black girl to fill diversity quotas is pathetic.
3. Every scene was boring or cringe.
Let this garbage flop folks, speak with your money."
No one can beat Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.
This actually looks really good.
Willy wonka has always creeped me tf out i get john wayne gaycee vibes 😂😂
"DID NO ONE CATCH THE PHRASE HE USED?? 

""Scratch that, reverse.""

THAT'S GENE WILDER'S WONKA LINE!

I'M SOO STOKED THEY'RE GOING WITH THE OG 🥹🥹🥹"
Well... clearly far far overdone in the insanity department and Chalamet looks like he's performing in a high school play.  What are the odds this will be even halfway watchable?
Who noticed Mr.Bean😊
Another Warner Bros flop for 2023. They're having a bad year
ew
I thought they might make a new Willy wonka
Johnny Depp did it best❤
se ve muy buena
"What is this? I was hoping for something better. Gene Wilder was weird. Johnny Depp was weird. This guy has a soft voice and is like a young Wonka was splashed by some Disney mahic dust and lost his weird, creepy, smart Wonka charm. I'll pass."
"""Sorry, I've already started dancing now. Once we started, we can't stop 🕺💃"""
I think we're all watching just to see High Grant's Oompa Loompas
1:42 Mr. Bean
"Timothee Chalamet is a competent actor, though I wish it had been Johnny Depp."
"This. Is. Going. To. Be. Epic.

Johnny Depp can eat my shorts."
"You lost me, after “chocolate cartel” 

So dumb. 😂"
AHHHH IM GONNA LOVE ITT
Eagerly waiting for it
"1:40 if you pause, Rachel is in the movie (get the joke? 😅)"
"I like the scene where mr bean says “put away your willy, wonka” truly one of the movies of all time"
We all wanted this movie but now the trailer is out and we decide that we didn't need it.
"Who is that DILF in green though""?"
Absolutely not
Am I the only one who feels like willys mother looks familiar
I can't believe how much Matthew Baynton is in this trailer!! And Simon Farnaby has top writing credit?! I can't wait! Any fans of bbc Ghosts will know how good those guys are and if they're acting/ writing in it it's gotta be good!
"Okay but Johnny Depp … I ain’t feeling this willy to be wonka enough  , no hate but really 🥲"
Nice trailer👍
i've watched this trailer so many times I have everything memorized lol so good. I can't wait to watch the whole thing
Absolute atrocity to a good movie   You couldn’t pay me to watch this movie.
Extremely lame that they used such a mild color palette and ran the entire movie through an amber filter. Willy Wonka is supposed to be eye bleedingly colorful. Hollywood just continues to mess up visual design over and over and over with very few exceptions.
Through trailer i feel it's will be amazing🎉🎉
This looks terrible
"Big Lemony Snicket (series) energy.
(not an insult)"
There weren't this many blacks in england at this time.  Woke bs
Bro Just Turned Williy Wonka Into A MCU Movie 💀💀
so happy this isn’t another remake ❤ can’t wait to see it
kisi ne Candy Crush ka music suna 😍
Oh my gosh I never thought he would be the perfect Willy Wonka!! But chef's kiss!!
Willy wonka chocolate factory is the best hope johnny deep play the role but give other artist to shine
Johnny and Freddie >
Boring boring boring bring back johnny deep my god
"I’m so happy they are the original Oompa Loompas and not the ones from the Johnny depp version, I love he is dressed like a young gene wilder SO EXCITING and a great way to pay tribute to an amazing man"
Wonka’s villain origin story I love it
"I liked both movies equaly but I always thought Charlie and the chocolate factory was the better one to make a sequel/prequel out of just because of all the extra lore they added. Plus it's newer idk how to explain.

This is giving me vibes of like how they made a new wizard of Oz movie and they made a new Mary Poppins movie. If I remember correctly both of those were prequels."
Meh
🥰
I am so excited for this !!! LOVE Timothy Chalamet
i can smell the simps
*Oh. Hugh Grant. Is he a thing again?*
this is a good mix of magical and whimsical
Nooooooooooo...
Wow Amazing some childhood memories ❤️🍂
Rowan Atkinson is Back !!! 😍😍
i just threw-up in mouth a little
Rowan Atkinson voice😢 😂 heard
Jhonny Depp was the best Wonka
This looks exciting but why do I have a feeling that Wonka will turn out to be a villain? lol
This should be a crime
I'm so excited 🤩🍫
this looks like a Harry Potter movie
REGULUS WHAT R U DOING
Never expected that Timothee Chalamet got Wonka roles but I don't have any complaints. ❤
Can’t lie I don’t care for this movie but that shot where it transitions from daydreaming to normal was unreal
I don’t like what w-b did to J Depp.  Not supporting this company.
Johnny depp was the legend
I love his lack of whimsy! A great new take on this classic tale!
Looks pretty mid. I’ll give it a watch when it releases for sure.
"For me its always johny depp❤, but yes this looks good too"
So many boys commenting on this video it's pathetic.
She Wonka'd on my Willy till I Oompa Loompa'd in her Chocolate Factory
ok... let see what you guys give us
Edit: this the prequel
How many times are we going to see the same thing being remade over and over and over again
Guys I just saw Mr. Bean in this movie at 1:03
im so tired of seeing this mfs face everywhere
I dont know if this makes sense but timothee is too handsome and happy :))) I don't feel the mysterious vibe I got from Wiily Wonka
"The male Mary Poppins LOL 0:25, 1:47"
This is what real cinema looks like. Magic is about to happen.  Christmas is finally going to feels like a Christmas.
"there's a lot of great things in this trailer, but it's giving me more Johnny Depp Wonka rather than Gene Wilder Wonka"
I was all in when i see the Producer of Harry Potter .
Good no agenda from the community
"idk how I feel about this, I thought Johnny Depp's version made it quite clear how Wonka became a chocolate maker."
id rather go see barbie
The queen matida move 💀💀
Another franchise ruined
This is going to be a huge success.
Is that mr bean?beam? 1:42
Cute
Wowowowowowowoowowow
"Last time we got Lord Grantham in Paddington, now we got Mr. Carson here."
Sharing
i was not expecting to be this excited for this movie!
OMG Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa lol
Too much black
This looks terrible.
"Please make....original movies. Original movies as in....original characters that are not already characters in other movies. Please....do you guys need to mix your cocaine with dmt or something? Where's the original ideas? 

Hard pass for me. I want something that isn't an offshoot of a different movie. 

Probably why I haven't gone to the theaters for years."
Gonna watch only for Hugh Grant as the oompa loompa. Cracked me up
"Can’t wait to see this ♥️♥️♥️ 
Sooo excited ♥️♥️♥️"
Wow! Okay this actually looks pretty good!
12 yo me when i watched  Charlie and the chocolate factory in 2015
Is that? JOHNSON!
"Timothee Chalamet is playing the main role in more and more movies. Wow, respect"
Chalamet seems like a miscast. He's honestly the worst part in this trailer imo. I liked everything else especially the set design.
I never thought I would find Willy Wonka hot but here we are......
"I was very skeptical of this Timothy boi playing the chaharcter, but from watching the trailer, looks like he did a pretty good job for this role"
Doesn't seem too bad
This is just what we need. Great Actor that fits the perfect role. Would be interesting to see how Willy Wonka came to be.
Bro this is as woke as it couldd possibly get 😂 dudes really tryin to replace depp. Man…….
The fact that people dont realize that this is made to be a woke version than actual an art of a movie …. This is why we are where we are in America. God help us.
"The woke industry is destroying movies. If actors are selected based on being an African, it becomes the worst form of racism. These unheard of black actors are not even that good, they just seem to be the convenient ones."
"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Ninja Turtle.

Seriously though, why did these woke f*ck-heads have to replace Charlie with a little miss ebony?"
The fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Glad I could hear pure imagination on the big screen again.
No one can replace Johnny Depp
Why is this a thing? We don't need another Willy Wonka film
Gene Wilder is spinning in his grave. SMH
yuck why would u mess with the johnny D version
No.
"WHEN HE SAID ""I rebel"" I CLAPPED"
"So the backstory that nobody asked for, completely changing the image of the character from what it was in the original movie. Yeah, makes sense..."
"Im sure they must have done a marvellous job in directig this film but the sheer magnitude of big actors casted in this film just to support Timothy just goes to show the sheer lack of talent in his own right. You can remake all the movies that stared Johnny Depp but nothing will ever surpass the success of his film. Depp is pure talent that no fresh blood, good looks and star studded support can subdue. Let see if your CGI can help 😂"
Жопка.
Im glad willy wonka lives on for a new generation.
looks pretty bad ngl
I am something of a magician myself
Mid
I haven’t even finished the trailer and I can tell you Chalamet missed the mark. I was optimistic. Movie looks good but him not so much.
"A movie that we don't really want, but they're giving it to us because laziness has a become a big thing in hollywood..."
Better be cameo of real Wonka candy. Like the commercial Wonka candies.
"The reason we can't see dislikes, lol"

I'm Surprised WIlly Wonker isn't a African American female
"This looks super fun & Hugh Grant as the Oompa's, YES! Keegan M. Key AND Mr. Freakin' Bean!! BUT, one thing. Even though Tim is the man. They really dropped the ball by NOT making Gene Wilders old character = Jeremy Allen White! I mean c'mon!? They're practically twins. Plus dude's already blowing Up after Shameless & now the bear. I'm still checking this out though 😁"
MID
"At least another iconic character hasn’t been black washed, that’s enough for me to watch it."
Excited! I just hope that boring Willy Wonka impersonator on TikTok does show up more for me after this
This looks terrible. They're doing magic candies now instead of science based research and development candy that took Wonka decades to figure out ... ugh. And what is with this over the top score? It's all wrong.
Nope
I've never heard of this story. Has it been told before?
"Who , it a no..."
Too many black people. Pass.
"lol saw this back in cinemacon, seeing hugh grant as oompa loompa always cracked me up"
"What are you doing Wonka?
*looks directly at the camera*
Making chocolate....remember cuz from the movie?!?!? AND LOOK ITS AN OOMPA LOOMPA HORRAY"
nope you guys should have begged johnny depp instead
ummmmm pass
I really hope they release Wonka bars because of this movie. Really miss those things.
I didn't see this coming :)
Another original idea from Hollywood
Wow this looks like the brown stuff - and I don't mean chocolate.
I love this
"Oooo,a black person. Can't wait for the angry keypad warriors to join the chat🤭"
"It looks okay, but I don't like the tiny cgi oomph loompa. It's uncanny compared to the original."
Snowpiecer Prequel 🤔 [Thumbs Up If You Get This Reference]
One of the most beloved classics is coming back with the origin story of willy wonka I've seen the movies both willy wonka and Charlie and the chocolate factory I've read the book and I seen it on Broadway and this is next Christmas as come early this year.
Looks fun.....but what is going on? Who cares you millennial kahoots my ticket and find remaking movies with codes matters? Lol....the 1st 2 will always be the best. Any originals now days.....its like hollywood twilight zone....
"Idk about this.
Part of the charm of the book, OG movie, and even the remake was just how crazy and magical Wonka and his factory was compared to the relatively normal, mundane outside world. Here, the outside world already seems crazy and not at all serious, so there's no contrast.
Also, why change the origin of the Oompa-Loompas? Wonka was supposed to have met them for the first time in Loopaland. Here, one is following him around for some reason?"
It’s like he’s channeling Gene Wilder. Awesome.

Do not want.
not hugh grant being hired to play an oompa loompa
Missing Jhonny depp as willy wonkaa😍

Ill support this movie and watch it."
"I know what the music is referencing, but it still sounds like jurassic world trailer at the beginning"
What a waste of money.
at least people won't say johnny depp is the worst wonka now
"0:41 Penalty for day dreaming?😂😂😂😂
In which country?"
Kinoteatrda baxmaq lazımdı mütləqq
Gba
WTF IS THIS
"Gene Wilder’s Wonka was kind of dark and unhinged. Roald Dahl’s work had a strong hint of cynicism and black humour, as well as magic and wonder. This film just seems twee. Chalamet is trying too hard to be whimsical, with none of Wilder’s edge."
Too late. I've started dancing now. When we start we can't stop
Suprised Wonka isnt a black woman.
"A prequel to Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. Amazing! Astonishing!

Something to really look forward to."
IS THAT MR. BEANNNNN????
🤷‍♂️ It looks good to me.  But I love Willy Wonka.
Might actually give this a chance since its written and directed by the guy who did Paddington
👍👍
Why did they cast this guy 💀
Timothee😍😍😍😍
TIMOTHEE’S ACTING IS SOO GOOD
These idiots have no new ideas…. And they think we will pay for it.  Lol!
"definetly gonna watch this bc of keygan, rowan atkinson dan hugh grant lol"
"Oompa Loompas, i dont undertsand em, they are working for (white) Willy for free cause he is such a nice guy?`leaving theire country cause it is fun to produce chocolate? i think history teached us it didnt work that way. I want ooma loompas in charge, world wide, i think that would be even more fun."
Why is he talking like a Dr. Suess character?
Timothy chalamet better than mr beast ?
first time i’ve ever seen tim chalamet smile
That sure is a lot of black people for early 20th century England
the film communities when they realize this movie isn't for them but for children :-o
The Harry Potter reference in the suit at 1:09 is such a cute easter egg!
Is it just me or is this role not at all for timothee chalamet. He just doesn’t have it lol
"The basic reality that this is coordinated by the person who did the two Paddington films is sufficient to inspire me to watch this. Those movies were outright show-stoppers of exhibitions, narrating and heading."
brooooooo another one?? whyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I'm sorry but if he doesn't kill some kids is it really willy wonka
Beautiful #Bravo. Can’t wait for this magical movie…Thank you 👏🏾🫶🏾🍫
I’m definitely going to go and see this movie. And ya just know it will be fantastic
I wish it wasn't a musical.
cool
And then a lifetime later he goes on to make a contest where he brutally traumatizes 4 children and then gives his factory to a poor kid.
OMg Rowen Atkinson Is Playing Willy wonka?? WOW❤
This looks so bad...
Another box office BOMB.👎
It just keeps getting worse.
Why do i remember ollie wonka from boys planet lmao
"Roald Dahl made Wonka very mysterious. That's the point of him. Tim Burton made his own origin story. Now we have a origin story of Wonka. Yeah, I'm not watching this. I prefer to keep Willy Wonka's origin story a  mystery to me. This is why Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me. His story is almost at a no origin story. So I rather keep it that way. Not every character has to have an origin story. Some things are best left alone and should stay that way."
This looks terrible.
"Bro actually said ""Put my thang down, flip it and reverse it"""
No thanks. Ill watch the scenes of Hugh Grant on youtube and that about does it.
Idk
Hmmmm...
I feel like Hugh grant was the only good part of this tbh.
"Not another one, can't they come up with anything new, just keep rehashing old movies, boring"
Omggggg
"A double huh 
I got an idea😂👍👌"

"I hope no LGBTQ kind of thing in this masterpiece, cause i just want to enjoy the story and moment"
:^)
Why are there a bunch of Sub Saharan Africans in the film?
Where my Mexican 🇲🇽 people at? All I see is white and black.
This looks stupid. Not wonka at all. Dead in the water. This is more magic then candies.
I don't remember so many Africans in the Willy Wonka tale.
I cant believe the comments Im reading in this comment section. This movie looks aweful and it will be absolutely terrible.
Should have taken johnny dep as the wonka 🙄
Какая же унылая хуета(
Who decided that this movie needed to exist? This is the most easily predictable flop.
Nope.
"holy this looks really bad like, i almost couldnt imagine a worse concept or worse cast, especially in this climate where so many movies are flopping"
I think people who are hating on this movie already look too hard into every detail. I grew up reading the book and watching both movies. I'm honestly happy that they're expanding on one character who is so magical and fantastic that you wanna know how he got started. I think it adds something interesting to the history of one of if not the best children's stories ever told. I hope this movie does amazing because people need something to dream of again and the only person who can make dreams come true is the one and only Willy Wonka.
Is that Mr frickin bean
when?
Ok…..Hugh grant as an oompa loompa was something I never knew I needed. 😂
They couldve kept this honestly.
This shoulda been a wes anderson movie idc
"This is definitely not my kind of movie but since Hugh Grant is an Ommpa Lommpa, I will definitely go & watch it..."
"Ah yes, the little orphan african girl in ""London"" spunky sidekick helps the inept hero overcome all odds."
I hate willy wonka 👎👎👎👎👎
"In this era of absolute abuse of CGI and visual effects all these movies lose their original script magic to become just choreographed shows of nonsense. Chalamet can hardly match the ""insanity"" of Gene Wilder. Even the Johnny Depp one was at least acceptable because he did his character very 'weird', as usual, and that was ok for what you expect in Wonka. But this one is just trying to be cute. That's not the spirit."
Жопка
mr bean its here
"Getting desperate for entertainment, or what? Screech is Wonka?"
It’d be funny if someone did a horror edit of Wonka taking away all the Oompa Loompas from the wild and locking them up to work in a Victorian era chocolate factory.
I LOVE WONKA CANDY!! CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE!!✋🥰👊🔥👍🎥😎😘🤜🤛🤩😲🤚
Might be alright. Although I wish Hollywood would come out with something new instead of reusing the same old stuff. Also I just don't see this guy as willy Wonka. He just doesn't fit the script for me personally. It seems way too forced.
Am I the only one that does not like Timothy as Willy wanka like his acting does not seem like it fits the role well :/
Do black people ever get to have original movies or do they always get sloppy seconds?
Yeesh 😬 Not sure this was casted well
"The black co-lead and cast are there to satisfy diversity/inclusion clauses. I’m not at all saying it is wrong or ignoble. Only that it’s ‘intentional.’ With that in mind, good luck fully immersing yourself in this fantasy while you watch."
ok
this ad bumped outta nowhere into my face while i was trying to watch spider man doing miles mom
i dont want u are ruin my life
No
"Ummmm, I'm unreasonably excited about this."
Is this going to have musical numbers?
I'm missing Johnny Depp 🥺😔❤️
I'm... not opposed to it...
This dude is definitely not the right actor for Willy wonka
This is just Cruella for bottoms
I don't know how to feel about this. Nothing will  beat the classic.  Just saying
Oh god I can hear the TikTok thirst edits already
Black co star for inclusion sake
OMG the prequel I never thought I needed bla bla bla bla tears OMG
I'll only watch this for Hugh Grant
Wow cool film жопка
Willy Wonka and the chamber of secrets
"""Once we started, we can't stop."" Immediately sing a song while a child is being traumatized and humiliated..."
Coca king😕+😮
"Yes, yes, absolute yes!"
"Rowen Atkison? Great! Just wish he had a bigger part, he is hilarious."
Dentist tooth fairy son he's a nymp😦oh no?
"I get strong RDJ in ""Mr. Willowby's Christmas Tree"" energy here, which is a very good thing!"
*Hard Pass* due to no inclusion of little people (one of the most marginalized groups in society). This makes me very sad. It's not just about the money the little people could have earned. It's also about who wouldn't want to be in a big movie?!? and have something to share with your family for generations. 😢
Where is Johnny Depp
I knew nothing of this movie until today. Wasn’t sure about it until I saw Hugh Grant 😂 I’m in!
". . . MEH. Looks like a mixed bag. Ill wait until the second week, if people report what I THINK they'll report. Im done donating my hard earned money to the first week of mediocre movies. The only thing in this trailer that wows me, is the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa. That gave me warm fuzzies, I gotta say. 😊😊😊"
I'm only in it for Sally hawkins
"Isn't Willy Wonka...evil? Doesn't he kill kids? At least, shouldn't we see him that way??"
Sooo it's a non-musical Jingle Jangle starring Timothy chalomet. OK.
Another IP crushed. Onto the next
"I normally hate the ""hurr durr, the trailer showed the entire story"" comment you see, but unfortunately, hurr durr, they really did show the entire story here, didn't they?"
Johnny Depp’s performance of Willy Wonka will always be my favorite
what is wrong with you
Timothée will be indeed one of the greats of our times. And I have the privilege to grow up in such a time!
“Discover how Willy became Wonka” is my new favorite line now.
I’m still waiting for Dune 2 haha
Meh
omg rowan atkinson
This trailer reminds me of Charlie and the chocolate factory ❤
OMGSweet Tea！！！！！！！
he was dating with captain Sparrow’s daughter and now starred in a film that Sparrow had starred in🎉
"No, thank you I do not need a prequel"
"Chalamet was awesome in the king and dune

But this looks like a miscast"
It's almost as if Hollywood is unable to imagine a fictional world without 21st century American demographics
"why do they have to show so much in trailers? i feel like the movie isnt even worth watching any longer...

cool, he made chocolate that made people fly.

why should i watch the movie now? they just revealed some of the most climactic part of the movie."
"0:09-0:13. I've read the original charlie and the chocolate factory many times growing up and i don't really remember wonka saying things like that,so im assuming that this is a tribute to gene wilder"
Honestly I think Tom would’ve been a better fit
Ffs another prequel?! Come on!
Is there a soundtrack for this on Spotify
"They really could have gotten actual little people to play the Oompa Loompas, but otherwise, this looks interesting."
❤
Looks very cute
Needs more artificially injected minorities. Not woke enough just to add a female black sidekick.
At least there won’t be any cursed gum this time around right?….. right?…..
"This is a movie we don't need. Just this trailer breaks cannon, I'm not looking forward to more of this..."
ALL THE ENGLISH GREATS!!!! and the greatest American amongst them of course…… can’t wait to see this💗💗💗💐
I know what I am going to see on my next birthday. ;)😊
I'm realize if Johny depp be more amazing after seing this
Didnt know mabu acted
Only watching it for Timothee Chalamet lol
Looks like trash. It’s gonna bomb at the box office for sure
Damn…these comments are sus…
Yikes…. Hard pass.
"Después de tantos filtrajes, finalmente sucedió. Le voy a dar una oportunidad sólo por estrenarse en Diciembre!!"
No
"Where's the part with Willy getting ready for combat, saying to the other chocolatiers, ""May your ladles chip and shatter.""?"
♡♡♡♡♡
"Lol.yeah, its really hard to sell chocolate that makes you fly"
i love thisssss. because i hate previous willy wonka cause its look creepy. the vibe i really hate it
"Aw heck yeah, the Germans got me interested."
Weird seeing Paul atreides in Willy wonka
"I didn't want to like it as I have grown up with Roald's version,but I have to say, I like it!! Can't wait to watch it!"
"Seems strange there are no bad reviews. I'll be different. Doesn't look good to me at all. The lead looks like a guy trying to be Willy Wonka, but really isn't. i have no desire to see this at all. Cringe."
I bet Mr. Wonka doesn’t know what county chocolate was discovered in haha I do 😅
Oh snap they remastered the original Willy Wonka! It's a actual Christmas miracle! (that's the time it'll play nearby)
"Finally, a positive portrayal of a talented entrepreneur fighting against the economically inefficient cartel, while promoting the ever-great and ancient idea of ""dreams come true"" and ""dreaming is good"" and all of that in the modern day and age - I am very pleasantly surprised! Cheers"
I’ll enjoy it if I’m on drugs
Let’s just hope it’s not some Disney remake
Maybe it's just me. I am traveling and working without break. It felt home watching this. Not sure why!
can't wait❤
This is terrifying.   It looks good.  Really good.   So many bad movies lately but I haven't seen a trailer that's gotten me this excited in a long time.   BRING IT
Did i see Mall Cop
soundtrack is going to be extra chocolatey
The guy who made the hilarious to Paddington movies wrote this? All I needs to know
"AAAAA AKHIRNYAAA
DITUNDA MULU SOALNYA TAYANGNYA
AKHIRNYA BENERAN JADI TAYANG 
AKHIR TAHUN INI






















kayanya Timy bisa dapat peran ini selain emang karakternya cocok sama Timy, juga karena Timy pernah pacaran sama Lily anaknya Johnny depp ga sih, kek bisa pas gitu hahaha. soalnya ditahun yang sama pas Timy pacaran sama Lily disitu juga ada tawaran film ini hehe"
"TC is playing the character as intended, as someone who is quirky and intelligent, who is very forward but also has a huge heart.  As a prequel, I can get behind this."
"Thanks, I hate it"
"LETS GET THIS STRAIGHT
THIS IS A British version with American accents 😂"
"If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then there's no stopping him.
You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka."
This actor is not quirky enough to be Willy Wonka.
Something about his eyes ain’t selling it for me. Like he doesn’t believe he’s Willy Wonka
TAKE MY MONEY
To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
I could have done without Timothee. Don't know why he's everywhere
Something I never thought I wanna see: a Willy Wonka prequel!
ANOTHER WILLY WONKA??? YES
this guy already looks more subtle than johnny depp
Wow...very mediorce acting for a leading role.
Wow another remake from Hollywood.  Didn’t see that coming.
Who wonking they willy right now?
Only pirate actor can do better than this.
Can’t wait for this!
Yo tom holland would’ve been perf
"This looks exciting and did I spy Hugh Grant, Dan Foglar and Rowan Atkinson? Love the cast!"
Two words come to mind: *forced whimsy*
"i hope you all enjoy this, im gonna pass......"
Well thanks for showing me the whole movie
thats a big old nope
i CAN'T CRINGE HARD ENOUGH.  THIS IS GROSS.
"i gotta be honest, nothing against timothee chalamet, but he just doesn't seem like a good fit for this role to me"
"Did ChatGPT change ""strike that"" to ""scratch that?"""
Once we've started we can't stop. hahahahaha
Childish trailer not official😂
not my wonka
"Only thing that throws me off is we have to find out what happened to the little girl, why isn't she with Wonka anymore at the time of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory? Should've been the guy who played the role of Slugworth to try and trick the kids."
Oh Johnny….😮
When will we see him turn into the sociopath child mutilator murder we know and love?
i’m so proud of timmy!🥺💗
"I'm gonna say it, this movie looks awful."
Needs more diversity and LGBARF representation.
"So. What's up with these top comments and their profile pictures on a trailer for a children's movie? And they each have multiple highly upvoted comments? Also, many of these comments have replies that all have a random string of letters/numbers. It's like someone's using YouTube comments like a numbers station"
"the “scratch that, reverse it” had me READY to watch this guys, fr, i cannot wait, lol"
I came to the comments to look for some Dune Memes
HUGH GRANT
bro im afraid of the chocolate cartel
I was skeptical when I saw the preview on Instagram but I’m all in!!
Hugh' oomph loompa is going to be hilarious. Have a good feeling about it
ayeee i was scared to have a trash charlie & the chocolate factory reboot but a willy wonka origin story is sooo dope asf
"Oh, gee. Another movie we've seen before.
Wouldn't want to ever pay an writer again, now would we?
Staff writers forever. Stale plots twisted to male a political point! Yay!"
The new annie movie looks lit
"After seeing this was an actual movie one thought came into my mind.


Dear Hollywood.







It's over......."
Can’t believe timothée is almost 30 he don’t look like it he looks like a teenager
lmao at Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) playing a priest.
"Cringe, such an unnecessary movie. Another woke movie where they have to force inclusivity smh"
"Yup, definitely a movie i'd go to the theater to watch for sure, too bad i have to wait till Christmas time but i'll try to remember to look out for it in the coming months."
"Hey Hank, we found your W. W. / Heisenberg … !"
Se ve prometedora esta reinvención
"To be honest, I think I'd watch that, just out of curiosity. Timothee was great in Dune."
so they already screwed up. replacing a soda that makes you fly with chocolate. Damnit Warner Brothers. This is why DC movies fail
no movie in the recent decade has had me this hyped. This actually looks really good!
I AM A CHOCOLATERE I AM A CHOCOLATERE I AM A CHOCOLATERE MR WONG
If only Gene Wilder was here to see this. RIP
"Okay, that... actually looks really fun."
Is it Charlie and the chocolate factory sequel/ prequel?
I like that’s it’s a prequel. I’ll go see it on Christmas ❤
Looks interesting
🍑🍑🍑🍑
So clearly the story is narrated by Hugh Grant…. Which would make the original Wonka cannon. Which means the black girl end up dying somewhere at some time because she’s not in the future installments
WHY? Another one? Jesus.They all sucked.
This is one of those movies you'll only ever see in parts at family get togethers when they need to put something on for the kids.
omg hugh grant hahahah was not expecting that
"Thank god they still put matt lucas as a cast, what a magical person he is 💞"
Okay Hollywood this looks good!  So far have two movies that I will go see in theaters and this is one of them.
"I prefer matt lucas playing oompa loompas at first, but hugh grant actually gave us OOMPA LOOMPASSSSS!"
Well Tim seems to be the Johnny deep of our Generation and I ain't mad about it 🙂
😂😂😂 His acting is so stiff 🙄💀
Is this a musical? Wack
anyone hating needs to stop watching kids movies expecting a not kids movie
I'm going to call a flop right now.  I don't see how anybody would want to watch some sort of prequel to the books.  I mean what's next? A life story of The Phantom of the Opera guy ?
I remember being traumatized by what little I saw of the old version when I was a kid.
I don't like his voice. Trying to hard. Sounds stale and fake
pass
"Hope he knows, it's a never match to G.W.'s W.W.  hey! Read the book."
hmmm not feeling him as Wonka lol voice doesnt match
I’m already living
We lived long enough to witness a willy wonka prequel
Why is everything now days a sequel of something made already? Can't they just get creative and stop ruining old classics? This movie looks Like a Gimmick.
Not remotely reminiscent in tone or spirit to the original story. This looks awful.
"I have to say at least they LOOKED like the original (movie) oompa loompas! and that was kind of funny with Hugh Grant... ""once we start we can't stop"""
"Maybe if you made it look stylistically like the old movie, id probably watch it. The score, cgi, and vibe contrast the original. This just feels like a modern movie, not a prequel to a classic of cinema."
No day dreaming.dont give legislators ideas
Bro oompa loompas terrify me
อยากดูมาก❤
broooo im stocked
Looks cool. Now start paying your writers!
"Nope , forced diversity casting that doesn’t match the era …."
A movie nobody ask for.
I didn’t know Wonka was Italian
This looks so good!
"Just what we needed, a diverse, the patriarchy are stopping the world from being rainbow flagged movie. No thanks."
"WRONG!!! No... HECK NO!!!! 

so woke took over this movie... and after they change words in Rauld Dahls books now its selfish woke blm saying let's take every good movie made and completely take over the entertainment industry. How much does anyone want to bet that the ""Language"" has been changed? 

(little mermaid, teenage mutant, annie are other examples)

So i take it Tiana pochahontas jasmine moana esmerelda and all those disney characters are not enough either. 
oh and lets not forget how caucasians can't get a part now. because CHANGE...

well if you want to support racism go ahead but I am well above and far from that. You can't make new movies now entertainment industry? Have you even tried? nope. Woke is in the entertainment industry. And if we don't start saying something... Many more beloved actors and actresses will not get parts. Well, I'm done with your racism woke and BLM... I'm done lgbtq for your lame excuse to put a""MAN"" into a WOMANS sport. He was being LAZY and didn't want to try. just like woke is doing to these movie remakes. 

Go WATCH ""Sound Of Freedom"". It's based on a true story about child trafficking and it deserves your attention. 
If you don't want to gain your own opinion that is your option. I obviously can't make you do anything. But if you want to support BLM WOKE AND ANy Political idea... Bless your heart. 

Here are movies that had a lead african american role or co stars that were good to my memory:
I am legend, independence day, CHICAGO the musical, Rent the musical,  cool runnings, the A team, DIEHARD, Men in Black, Jumanji, pursuit of happiness, eddie, remember the titans, the birdcage, and more...

But you just gotta decide for yourself what made the movie good. Was it because politics were involved or was it because of being artistic and there were a wide variety in the cast... how about a new story... or Good vs evil good wins? 

But this is where I draw the line and y'all better not even touch shell silverstiene books. Taylor swift already has a golden book. YEah A GOLDEN BOOK the kid books ..... WHAT THE HECK!!! 

THIS HAS GOT TO STOP. and if noone will say it I WILL. 
A photo just black and white is black and white kind of boring sometimes. but when you have all the colors the image is beautiful.  THINK ABOUT THAT WORLD."
This movie looks absolutely trash
hey greg....
Looks great. Pay your writers.
"I didn't expect it to look so good, now I can't wait"
Can't wait to see how he enslaved the Oompa Loompas
I can tell you right now that he's not the one to play Wonka!!!!!! He's gonna blow this movie!
"My favorite part of the movie is when he said ""Its Wonking time!"" And then he wonked all over the place."
It's gonna be magical 💖
I can't wait!!!
Loveee it already. Looks like Peter Pan or the Witches Wardrobe 🧙
Why
"Honestly, this looks terrible"
Enough recycling stories for biopics. Lame
This is the best thing since everlasting gobstoppers.
The beginning of the trailer I was like eh. By the end I was like yep.
"Hard pass on yet ANOTHER cheap reboot. 🥱 Call me when they make something new, creative and inspiring."
So is he a sorcerer
"Oh Lord, it's woke. Guess they should change the name to WOKA!!!!"
"um... tell me this is one of those fake made by a fan , trailer spoofs.

seriously ANOTHER Wonka movie ???

can't Hollywood come up with ANYTHING new?"
Why did they have to pick him bro??😭
"Me: There's no way another movie franchise can be ruined...

2023: Hold my Indiana Jones"
I love a good origin story!
It should be Carmy from the bear as wonka
Why are they remaking everything! This is ridiculous!!! Where are the writersssss!
Gawd WOKE off the bat.
"ISNT THE POINT OF WILLY WONKA THAT HES ECCENTRIC IN A WORLD THAT IS DRAB AND REALISTIC?
WHY IS THEIR WORLD SO FANTASTICAL???
CHOCOLATE CARTEL???

WHICH NEPOBABY GREENLIT THIS?"
Nice
It will be fun watching what the online reviewers do with this one. Keep 'em coming! The swill must flow!
"Oh wow this looks really good, seriously hoping it does not disappoint."
Fantastic Oompa Loompas and Where to Find Them
"another remake, did people lose their creativity ?"
This comment section is infested with bots. Turn back now.
It’s supposed to be Willy wonky not Harry Potter
He's giving Nikola Tesla not willy wonka...
This looks absolutely abysmal.
"When I see this trailer, the first character that appeared in my mind is Jhony Deep"
"Chalamet is a splendid actor…but why am I wondering what D Radcliffe could have done with this role, cast and director"
"At first I was like, Timothee seems so serious, I can’t see him as Willy Wonka. But now that I see the trailer, I know he’s gonna be AMAZING."
"We are going to get everything but the origin to the ""Tunnel""."
Finally we can fix what Johnny Depp f up . This is what it should have been . This kids gonna crush it .
"this trailer threw me off. his facial expressions and movements feel heavily edited, but im assuming its to add onto his character. so weird"
😔 this doesn’t seem as great as I hoped it would be. I guess Gene Wilder just ruined it for all the predecessors because this feels lacking.
"DECEMBER 15!!!😭thats too long 
*cries"
the black girl makes no sense in the movie..
I didn't think it was possible to make the Burton version look good. But they did it. TC is a good actor but god damn talk about mis-casting.
Meh..😐
Shocked to say this looks pretty decent.  It'll never touch the original.  But the director of Paddington is the right guy for the job.
why do some of the scenes look like they're set in the ministry of magic ? lol
we finally get a sane willy again
1:42 Mr. Bean?!
Please God stop remaking movies and rewriting legacy characters to be nothing like themselves.
He is NOT Wonka!
"""Every Good thing started with a dream, so you hold on to yours""✨"
*Ж О П К А*
"me, after viewing this trailer .. ""you get NOTHING, you LOSE, good day sir!"" I will not be seeing this, sir WB. Sorry"
I ran to this at the speed of Matthew Baynton
He is literally copying Johnny Depps way of talking for this movie but worse this doesn’t even need to happen
I want his chocolates. 🥵
I'm over here smiling and tearing up at the same time. I absolutely can't wait.💕
It’s story is done come up with something new
none of these comments are real bffr rn with me this looks bad timothee (peace and love) is not camp enough for this
Timothy as wonka? Can this rewrite my childhood…
I thought Mr. Bean was dead
no…just…no
"Where is Johnny Depp? 
I like Johnny for Willy Wonka"
Chalamet is horrible. What's wrong with you people?
This is so strange. Wouldn't the origin story of Willy Wonka be dark? He's practically a villain. He's enslaved a tribe of small people to make his chocolate and seems to despise children and the people trying to steal his chocolate. Isn't that what makes his character so interesting? He makes a product for a consumer he hates. I want to see the origin of THAT.
Another leftie destruction of a classic
"Acting seems real bad, pass"
"Whoa, the first Chalamet picture I am completely disinterested in."
Its kinda sad to see johnny depp and that other dude not as wonka but he still looks cool
This is going to be woke and pointless
Omg this look absolutely horrendous hahahahahaha. It’s almost as if Hollywood is incapable of making anything good now. Bahhhh
Maybe it’s just me just Timmy just isn’t quirky enough for this movie
"Yehhhh.... No.... None of this is in the original novel. Too much blatant blackwashing of history, too."
What a load of absolute shite bollocks
He seems like a kid compared to Johnny depp he just looks so young 😂
MATTHEW BAYNTON!
"When I was a child the original Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite movie. I would watch it every day multiple times a day and make my whole family watch with me. Most of my family got tired of me asking them to rewatch it for the 100th time but my grandma never did. She always watched it with me, sung the songs, and rehearsed the lines with me. she never got tired of it. Earlier this year she passed away and I wish I could see this with her but when it comes out I will go see it in honor of her with a empty seat next to me just for her.

Edit: I didn’t mean the one with Johnny Depp I meant the original movie with Gene Wilder just forgot it was named Willy wonka and the chocolate factory instead of Charlie and the chocolate factory."
please let this be a banger bro
Never liked the original.  Won’t like this one either.
Who is that girl again?
i will watch this because Timothée Chalamet is in it 🥰
oh cool another garbage wonka movie
So this must be the younger Wonka based off Gene Wilder’s portrayal? Considering how the Oompa Loompas look 😂
"Finally a movie from my Nostalgia I actually had goosebumps that from a trailer I wanted to see. It might not look as good without Gene Wilder or even Johnny Depp, but if mine reaction was to get chills from watching this trailer, I have to see the movie. I wonder how the next trailer for Wonka is going to be. Warner Brothers, I think he may have just hit this one out of the park with a homerun."
That here we go momma hit 😢
I’m not feeling it… Some things should be left as is.
i’d only hope this movie will bring back the wonka bars! they were soooo good! 😫
I absolutely HATE everything about this...and how DARE them make his costume look like Gene Wilders.  STOP MAKING REMAKES!!!
this is going to be perfect for the christmas season
Cool to see Jason Goldstriker's origin story
This looks like a really good movie to get really stoned to.
Ik Jhonny depp is the best Willy Wonka but he is too old for the role
Make something new
"I don't know what looks more fake. the lighting and colors, the effects or Tim's acting. Shame."
"Honestly, I just cant help but think of Lies of P when I saw this trailer because they based Pinocchio's appearance of Timothée Chalamet. Which btw, I can't wait to play that game."
"So, considering the appearance of the Oompa Loompas, this is a prequel to Gene Wilder's movie?"
forced diversity and terrible acting... ill pass
Who ever decided to cast him as wonka is a genius✨
"im gonna be alone here for sure.  But this looks so over the top cheesy, and not in a good kids film kind of way.  Just seems like its another kids movie with too much happening and not enough time to absorb it or care.  It just looks awful, and the trailer pretty much showed the entire plot.  Usually they do that when the movie has no substance.  Crazy"
"Oh good! ANOTHER movie remake. 

Hollywood is a bunch of hacks trying to change culture by modernizing classic movies so people won't watch the old ones because the old ones would judge their current actions."
Love love Wilder as Wonka so another remake felt unnecessary but seeing this is a prequel  I'm down
This feels very magical and whimsical! I love it already!
Are you telling me that Willy Wonka is from the same universe as Harry Potter and Newt Scamander?
Great Chance to see a great inspiring creative movie
"Haven't been excited to see ANY film since the pandemic, this one is making me tingle!"
I wonder if Willys father or even Charlie will make an appearance
I love you timothee chalamet. Every thing he touches turns to gold. Can't wait
Whack.
"the fact thet it's gonna be released in winter makes it more perfect, and dont forget that there'll be rowan atkinson in the cast list! omg
❤❤"
Monka
"Is this really a new movie about Willy Wonka, and not about magic?😂"
"Surprised they didn't cast a ""chocolate"" man to run the chocolate factory."
I'M SO STOKED FOR THISSS
"Not quite sold on it.  It just feels like a reskinned Greatest Showman, based on this trailer.
Then there's the fact that this is a prequel, and we know it'll end with someone betraying him, followed by the store closing, the factory gates being shuttered, and Willy becoming a reclusive shut in."
How Willy became ...Wankah !!!!!
this looks amazing
"Oh brother, how many times are they going to remake the same movie or beat down this topic like a dead horse?"
"Oliver, Oliver, Oliver... Willy, Willy, Willy..."
This looks horrible….but I bet it be “good”. Judging from all the bad movies that looked like they were going to be good.
I miss the Johnny Depp version!
I hate modern day vibe jokes  and dialogue in antiquity vibe movies also this seems like the grindlewald movie
The chocolate must flow
Chocolate cartel seriously?💀
Rowan Atkinson stole that trailer.
Seeing the orange Oompa Loompa means that this Wonka prequel takes place before the Gene Wilder version because the Tim Burton version made the Oompa Loompas have natural skin colour
timothee chalamet is hot but hes no gene wilder thats for damn sure. imo these gen z kids will never be the comedians we used to have because theyre just too tainted by internet culture
We don't need this
These comments bouta be from 5 years ago
This looks awesome
"Through the entire trailer: what horror have they created, I won’t watch it
Hugh Grant oompa loompa: damn it I have to watch it"
Little does Willy know that in a few years his shop is gonna belong to a boy named Charlie Bucket.
poor delivery. just stay with brooding roles man
se
"When I saw the guys eat the flying chocolate I was like ""The only way to get down is to burp""."
"the 1960's Wonka a will NEVER be outdone haha.
these lazy remakes with modern 'charm' will forever be monotonous."
Why does this actor look and sound like Daniel Thrasher?
looked like a pass until the Hugh Grant bit… might watch this just for that.
"Sweet, another prequel to Snow Piercer!"
I didn’t care til I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompah
i love itt.. its very whimsical
ITS TIMMY TIM YEAH
"W. imsical
O.
N. derfull
K. ayotic
A. mazing

How i describe this trailer and hopefully the movie. 😊🎉"
"Being 57 years old, I will confess that as I began watching this trailer, I was thinking ""but....he isn't Gene Wilder"". By the time I got to the end of the clip, I was hooked. I get it now. A fresh, new look at a classic. I am now looking forward to seeing this!"
It's like he's a blend of the two previous versions with his own unique flavor. Gene Wilder's whimsy with a bit of Johnny Depp's wackiness.
What I was hoping Fantastic Beasts was going to be like...
Carson from Downton is also here!
"Ew, musical? Goodbye"
"My expectations are low but I hope I'm pleasantly surprised.

Hugh Grant might save this single handedly though"
This is what I call a movie!
"Willy Wonka! 😃
I would like to learn and know the story of Willy Wonka."
Good lord make it stop!!!
"Wait, is that Johnny English?"
I'm glad to see Timmy getting out of his comfort zone with this role however he seems a bit too young for this character
I was just saying where’s the Oompa Loompas…and then Hugh Grant!!
"Oh wow, another remake.  How oh how I wish something original came out"
TIMMYYYY ❤❤❤
"you can never beat the original, Charlie and the chocolate factory Gene Wilder as Wonka was the best. Johnny Depp as Wonka was awful why are they making a 3rd Wonka? at least this one looks better than Johnny Depp's Wonka will i go to pay money to see this new Wonka maybe."
"We definitely need this. This will be worth the waiting. Take your time, Warner Bros. Make this movie as best as posssible."
"Awesome Trailer!
I figure with the cost of the popcorn, goobers, and a medium sized coke I just saved $22.50."
Yes omgggg so excited to watch
I'm shocked. They didn't turn Willy Wonka into a female latin character.
"As a diehard Dahl purist, this should feel like blasphemy... but I kinda want to see it"
You know it’s gonna be bad since Keegan Michael Key is in it
ANOTHER wonka movie? righto
Awesome
This looks rough and just devoid of magic.
"I've always L❤VED Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.  My favorite nostalgic movie, next to The Wizard of OZ! Looking forward to this!"
This looks so good! I’m only a little puzzled as to why this Willy Wonka has an American accent. Isn’t the story based on England? Even the Oompa Loompa (Hugh Grant) speaks with a British accent.
The theme❤❤❤
"nope! scratch that, reverse it!"
1:14 incredibly in character for Keegan 😭
The Oompa Loompas!!! yooo hahahah
Ohh boyy this film is gonna make Christmas the best day ever by filling the atmosphere with some great epic adventure as we see Willy's journey on becoming a huge chocolate maker out there
"Wow, this looks awful."
This is going to be good. I’m really excited for it.
No.
The Chocolate Cartel 😭😭😭
"Imagine if Wonka 2 comes out in 2024/2025 where Charlie, Augustus, Violet, Veruca and Mike appears in the second"
Idk y but hearing theres a chocolate cartel made me laugh.
Why do we need another Wonka movie?
Looks kinda bad to me tbh and I feel like Timothy Chalamet is in everything atm.
What a mess. What happened to Johnny depp
"Hope this one will be good. I still absolutely LOVE the original from 71, and sometimes still find myself singing “oompa loompa, loombadidoom” x)"
"2:08 ""Weighing 248 lbs...TAZ!

""IT'S TAZ!"""
Looks awful
it shouda been Johnny Deep.
Too bad the story is sumed up in the trailer... They did it again !
Am I the only one who thought nobody but myself would care for this movie?
No thank you.
Timothee chalamet??
Black people in Victorian England? No thanks! Utter BS! We were NOT free then!😡 Stop twisting history!
"“Candy is dandy , but liquor is quicker” , nice try but Gene Wilder IS the only Wonka"
This looks awful.
I'm watching for Olivia Coleman
They made Wonka Super BRITISH
Why is there black people.
This looks fun.
thats keaty from the beach
Fock this
"What a absolutely wonderful, I’m sure, it actors Rowan Atkinson an priest in wonka, so excited to see wonka movie"
NOOO
"There's a disconnect, not that i don't like him, but it's a miscast for me"
🤣
qué ganas de comer chocolate estoy re manija aguante la droga
0:45 bro that literally looks exactly like daniel thrasher??? Am i going insane?? Daniel thrasher the funny piano guy???
Mr Beast already did this but okay
"I'm not buying it. If it reviews well after a few weeks, maybe. But after 10 or so years of getting tricked by Hollywood, it's time to stop getting falling for trailers :p"
"Can’t wait for this, looks fun"
Its about time some one did this....I hope they get it right!
Yo Mr beast got that budget man 😂😂
Is that daniel thrasher the funny piano guy?
This is before he got his willy
"""How can we ruin another great childhood movie?"""
"the only thing I care about is how much ""added sugar"" it has in its nutritional value."
Mr bean in it
"A film about a way lively Willy Wonka with optimism and humanity BEFORE he became the recluse and cautious candy maker we grew up knowing.

I'm sold."
"This looks so good, I can't wait! ❤"
"really not a fan of hugh grant as an oompa loompa, and always hated the original oompa loompa design, so the only movie i’ve been looking forward to for a year is already disappointing me :/"
Willy Wōka....great.
"You see, I'm something of a magician, myself."
It just doesn't have the charm of the first one.
looks terrible lol
muito bom mas infelizmente não é o johnny depp ai fica dificil
Everyone picking out the smallest detail to justify watching this absolute disappointment
"They horribly miscast Wonka in this, sadly. Great actor, but completely wrong for the role and this performance just looks so wrong."
So this is before he goes evil and starts killing kids?
This looks terrible 😂
This actually looks really fun. I like it.
Hmmm more remakes....
I think I've never been less excited for a movie in my life after seeing a trailer.
My childhood 😢 willy wonka 😮
Christmas can't come soon enough!
"What's bizarre to me about these kinds of diversity pushes in film is that Identitarians are constantly harping about making movies for 'modern' audiences, yet the black representation in this trailer doesn't come anywhere close to matching the demographics of modern day Britain.

""Black British citizens, with African and/or African-Caribbean ancestry, are the largest ethnic minority population, at three percent of the total population.""

And yet a clueless viewer watching this movie in vacuum might come away with the impression that black people in Britain range anywhere from 40% to 50% of the population! That is a RIDICULOUS over-representation. The only name I can really give to the phenomenon is 'black fetishism'. And seemingly only black fetishism because the director apparently doesn't give a damn about Asians or Middle Easterners or Indians or any other ethnic group."
This looks exciting
lets go timmy t!
🤮
"THE BACKGROUND MUSIC !!!! When I heard the melody of ""pure imagination"", I GOT CHILLLLSSS!!! This is gonna be a good one!!"
"Yeah it feels like a Paddington movie, just not in the good way. Sure, this movies gonna do fine with toddlers, but the chocolate factory we all know is a classic for everybody. Wonka is trying so hard, on a level of cringe that screams desperation. Why is everyone so fruity and musically entwined? Why does every piece of dialogue include a pun?"
Trash
Wonka movie can not wait on Disney plus
Жопка
Anyone noticed key and Peele?
Every top comment you're seeing is the most obvious use of bots/AI I've ever witnessed on the internet
NO
0:31 UM MATTHEW BAYNTON?????
Wonka: “I’m something of a Magician myself”
Ridiculous and unnecessary
Hollywoke are creatively bankrupt.
"okay. i was really skeptical of timothee playing willy wonka, but…i think he really did his homework"
Was that Rowan Atkinson? ❤️
Tim whoever as Wonka might be the worst casting decision of all time
This looks awful i'm not going to lie
Looks like 💩
I don’t like it maybe I gotta watch again 😂
This looks nowhere near sinister enough
"❤I Love this new Version of this movie 🍿💖🍿
It's going to be So
Great!🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿🍿💖💓💝💞💗💕💘💖"
No one will ever be as good as Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka. Ill pass on this.
"I don't know if it's just me but Timothée Chalamet is the only one I feel icky about which is weird because he's the main role, I don't get that energy and bipolarism the two other adaptions of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory had. I don't know if it's just me or if it's too soon to even judge but I just wanted to share my thoughts."
"I'm being very honest; this film is going to tank at the box office. It just seems quite a pointless movie going in a pointless direction. Just like one character says ""nothing to see here!"" It's not saying anything new on the previous incarnations. I can see this will most definitely flop."
"Hopefully we don’t see any dead kids in this movie. Other than that, I hope this adaptation lives up the hype."
They literally couldn’t have cast Wonka better😆and OH MY GOD from the producer of Paddington and Harry Potter?! It’s gonna be a masterpiece
this looks pretty cringe.
Cant wait!
"Why do they have the floating candies when this is supposed to be a prequel? Maybe I'm just dumb, but gramps who worked for Wonka for decades seemed really surprised when they floated in the original."
I had to watch this twice coz all i spent most of this trailer just wondering if i saw Olivia Colman ..then i saw the list of names and i was right!!
Them basing this after Gene Wilders willy wonka .....God my heart....❤
"I love that they kept the original Oompa Loompa look, and Hugh Grant in the role might actually be genius 😂"
sequel or prequel?
"once we start dancing, we can not stop!"
Ofcourse they were going to add a black female character with willy that will get half of the screen time. Ofcourse...
"I hope they visit Loompa Land and show the Wang-Doodles, I’ve always wanted to see it!"
nee
Stop making movies that have been made already!!!!. Be original make your ideas
He's no Gene Wilder but I'm going to give it the BOTD for the love of Wonka.
this performance would make more sense if timothee was in a fedora 🕴️
Watched it again. It's growing on me.
Wilder? Depp? Some random clown? Once again hollywood proving they have nothing new to offer.
"but wait, didn't willy wonka discover oompa loompas on an island searching for new tastes?"
i already dont like this bro does not look like a willy wonka.
Why.
Is this woke like all the other new movies coming out?
"So stoked about these historical biopic movies coming back. First Oppenheimer, then Napoleon, now Wonka?! Can't wait! 😀"
So is there anything left of the movie to see?
…
"No thanks, I'll stick with Gene Wilder"
This is gonna bomb.
"the main probem i see here is that they are trying to present wonka as a nice, caring person. the character that we all known and fell in love with is NOT a good person - that's what makes him so interesting. he's a cold person that very rarely shows any sort of emotions. a bit disappointed that they are presenting the character in a new - and not so intersting and unique - way."
The chocolate must flow.
Boringgg
Willy Wonka is not a good person... lmao
this is morally and intellectually bankrupt
Miss Johny depp acting on this- that was a time.
Xd
I will
This little girl side character seems unnecessary considering we never see or hear of her in the original.
aren't  that Mr.bean as the running priest ??
Somehow I forgot what I was watching when this ad appeared and then 0:53 👁️👄👁️ so I definitely need to watch this✔️
Rowan Atkinson as the Priest with his Mr. Bean voice makes everything better.
HUGH GRANT AND ROWAN ATKINSON WILL CARRY THIS MOVIE BRUH 😭😭😭
this'll be a great holiday film!
No one is talking about how he embodied Wonka's attitude and made it his own. He made it a Wonka but a younger and dreamer version and I am here for it😊  I legit thought that the thumbnail was Johnny 😅
was that mr bean?
"This looks so cool and amazing, I bet Timothée Chalamet would do perfect as Willy Wonka just like how Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp did to their roles. ✨

And I can't believe that, both the director for ""Paddington"" and the producer for ""Harry Potter"" and Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa too?! Now that just makes it even more perfect. This just feels like a tale here. Both the book and ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" were my whole childhood and props to Warner Bros. for bringing back the classic book character! 🍫o(✦ ‿ ✦)o"
This actually looks brilliant and am I the only person who started welling up when he speaks to his mother? 😭
Ummmm....sorry Timothy blind simps.....but Timothy isn't timothing like he usually timothees.
"The truth is, the only reason I look forward to this movie is because they can go through all of the eras, and forget Gene and Johnny, and finally get us on the great glass elevator!"
Omg really another remake wow what a orginal idea bravo. 👏 👏 🙄
Doesn't look appealing
Yes people. We now live in an age of remakes.
"""From the director of Paddington""
That's already enough to convince me that this movie has every potential to be great"
"Aside from 50% of England apparently being black back then, this looks like garbage because it’s Wonka removed from his factory—the factory! You know, the most interesting part about the Wonka universe?"
"Might give it a try. The time period looks a little off to me, but my first experience was the Gene Wilder version which took place in the 70's which would have put him starting out just after WW2. This looks Victorian."
Johnny deep is 🤴🤴
Why? Why another one already? Wtf?
"On my birthday , amazing 👏"
"Maybe everyone gets to a certain age when you start to see your favorite movies as a kid get remade twice by now? Unfortunately I’m there, and it’s no fun."
Here we go momma made me cry 😭 that's not fair I can't wait to see it on Amazon
I wonder if Willy will get his chocolate store in the end. 🙄
Looks stupid!
I’m literally here from tiktok and ims that Timothy chammelt
this looks bad
Timothée Chalamet is a good actor but as Willy Wonka appears flat and not enthusiastic or expressive enough he doesn't show his trademark deadpan stare
This will be a perfect Christmas movie😊
"From the trailer it looks completely devoid of soul and character, I sincerely hope I'm wrong cause this is actually a good idea for a film :/"
"Rowan Atkinson won me over, definitely gonna have to watch this one."
Nobody needs this movie lol
No one will beat Johnny depp hes just a legend
Finally the prequel everyone needed
"I'am pretty simple man, I see Chalamet, I click it."
"Looks very promising, I'm sold."
WHY RUIN SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL 😭😭😭😭
NOOOO WHYYYY 😭😭😭
how many remake they gonna do?!!! ppl ran out of ideads!!!
"Wow this looks terrible, they’re not even trying anymore are they?"
Looks boring
I wish Youtube still let you see the dislikes
Having Rowan Atkinson alone makes this movie worth watching.
But why..
wait... I am actually really liking this
Musical boooo
no one can beat gene wilder or johnny depp as wonka ngl
This looks dumb af.
If he wasn't hot you guys would see he is a great actor but not for this role. The delivery on the opening lines in the trailer lol
how tf did u make willy wonka into a marvel movie lmfao
Was that gringots?
NO NOT ANOTHER
Жопка)
1:29 look at the guy in the yellow suit
Oh my goodness you can just feel that there is heart in this movie. Feels like i went back in time when that was what movies were made from. I am absolutely looking forward to this
If they show us how or why he becomes jaded and closes his doors at the end. I'm sold.
He’s not a good Willy Wonka. Whoever did the casting needs fired
why didn’t they ask johnny depp to do this instead he played the character before?
Never seen the world's fascination in Wonka
"Looks horrible, lol idk what you guys are smoking. Another poorly done modern remake devoid of soul and emotion."
His chipper attitude is getting me thinking something earth shattering for him is going to happen
Welcome to modern Hollywood where any given franchise will at some point get an origin story movie.
Hopefully after this we get another Charlie and the chocolate factory with  this cast
No
I don't want to be older than the guy playing Willy Wonka.
Lame. The corniness seems worse that depps version.
Nah.. this movie it’s too childish for me. Tim not even look like a man. 😂😂😂he’s just so young that’s all I have to say. It’s look Disney movie. Others wonkas movies was for everyone but this is only for kids.
I really thought Daniel Thrasher was playing Wonka for like this entire trailer
"1:19  A Great, emotional rendition of “Pure Imagination” The song which connected us to our childhood and Mr Willy Wonka himself."
"Seems like an amazing cast, an explosion of fantasy... except for the lead character! NO American spoke like that at that time if they looked like him.  Everyone else is ear candy to listen to except the American kid with poor elocution at the centre of this. And his lines appear to be just as cringe-worthy with its cheap English shaving off every consonant. Seriously, could NO ONE have spared a few extra $$$ to hire a proper vocal coach???"
"I hate how absolutely terrible this looks, when will they learn packing a movie full of celebrities doesn’t make it good 🤦🏽‍♂️"
That is the most boring portayal of Willy Wonka I've ever seen 😐 He's making the whole thing look like one of my 11yr old nephew's school plays...
The fact that Johnny deep isn’t playing Willy wonka upsets me he is the best in my opinion 😢
But wonka is johnny deep
this is aboutta be the most mid movie of the year
"Wow, looks like dreadful.garbage."
Oh my god?
The prequel to the remake of the original
Chocolate cartel?🤣
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!! *In my teenaged girl voice*
Looks horrible. TC is so annoying!
"There is ony ONE Williy Wonka and that was Gene Wilder.  However, i think he would be pleased to see Timothee Chalamet play a younger version of him.  Remember, ""there is nothing that he knows to compare with pure imagination."""
Timothee❤
Yeah.  No
Nah bro
I'm really so excited!!! 😮❤
is that a joke? legendary Rowan Atkinson has less than a second screen time in the trailer..
"I got to see an early screening and let me tell you, my favorite part was when he said ""it's Oompa time"". And then he loompad all over the place."
Black people?? No thanks
0:18 yeah I'm not doing this. Movies are so unoriginal.
I am so glad there’s a Willy Wonka without Johnny Depp.
Omg have to see it. But too long of a wait!!!
iM mAKIn cHOcOlaTe of CoURse
Way to ruin such a great childhood movie 😊
"A messiah, cannibal and a chocolatair. I've always suspected Wonka of being a bit off."
"Oh look, more woke garbage."
why am i lowkey hyped
Дебилы! Зачем? Идиоты!
Chalamet as vonka is as good as Jhonny depp
"Early Harry Potter vibes, looks great for Christmas"
Yeah no one asked for this.
another woke remake?
Great casting
This looks like a sweet love letter to the 1971 film and I love it
"Chalamet is awful here, everything he's delivering seems awkward and wooden. 

Hugh Grant will still get me in a seat. Lol"
Willie WOKE-Ah
this is gonna be a good feel good Christmas movie
this looks so bad
How many times do you need to thrash this? Come on!
His vocal performance is so flat. Just sooooo flat.
"I'm so excited. I just know it's going to be good. Also, I just love Timothy Chalamet"
"Keyyyy from key, and peele. Definitely watching this"
Why this looks like a cheap CGI B movie from Netflix France?
Johnny Depp is better
Looks like he was forced to do this.
johnny whyyyyyyy
That’s a Ravenclaw!
The pure imagination music in the background so much nostalgia and chills
"Nope. More ""diversity"" and ""representation"", and you can stick it where the sun don't shine!"
Timothys acting is kinda rough based on this trailer
No thanks...where's charlie
this is some bad acting.
closest thing we're getting to him actually being connected to Harry Potter
nah
"Woke-a, What a load of C*..."
Looking forward to it but miss Johnny Depp 😔
"this guy is becoming a world class actor, no ways!"
Жопка
Noooo no one can beat Johnny depp as wonka 😢 I’m sorry timmy
"Omg,,these remakes,,,no way this will touch o.g. wilder,,,"
Nah.
He’s a little too sane for me
I am NOT that guy... but sometimes you should cast a little person!!! What the heck? Oh well.
...........  ....Willy WOKE ....  .......
"Hey me again… Hollywood aka Pedo Central, how many kids you exploit today and how many have you taken."
Can already tell this is going to be a banger
OMG!!! Mr. Bean ❤
Looks awful. Next!
"The cast is again ""diverse"" except for the two shots of the ""bad guys"" in this story. They were all white."
Why do I feel like this is allegory for coke?
seems like he’s trying to hard to act like johnny depps wonka just younger
"Even though it kinda pisses me off that there has to be a third remake of Willy wonka, the director is incredible, cast is awesome and I shall be watching it.

Although Johnny depps Willy wonka will always be the greatest"
"All this payed bots are so cringe🤦🏻‍♂️ And seeing the actor who plays willi wonka already made me threw up, zero charisma, zero acting skills, why didn't they just let johnny play this make him younger with cgi since he already played the younger willi wonka"
OMG - this looks WONKALICIOUS !
Should’ve had Tim burton direct this .
cant wait for this horror movie
"Mr. Bean

<leonardo pointing at tv meme>"
Hugh grant hugh grant hughie grant hugh.. la la la
Who up wonking on they willy
baaahahaha another useless remake?! I love America! I love white people!! lol
Is better that Johnny Depp in the 2005 film of the same name
This looks soo bad
Why didn’t they cast Jim Carrey as the Oompa? Dangit!
This brought tears to my eyes ❤ I was just singing the Willy Wonka song the other night 🍫
It’s not Johny Depp
I love this movie already
Nah this guy cannot replace Johnny deep as Willie Wonka .
Except Willy Wonka was a villain. Lol. He wasn't the good guy.
Who is that little girl and why is she not in any other wonka movie
Chocolate must flow
"I can’t wait to see this, and it comes out on my birthday!! ❤️🍫"
This has to be one of the worst castings in the last 5 years.
WB been making a hof lineup of movies recently😮
This actually looks promising 😊
"I'm wondering, this time, how many children will be ground in with the recipe, how many will be obliterated by fans, how many will explode and so on. What's Wonka's torture and/or kill count now?"
AHHH
"Wilbur : Let me check your teeth, Willy"
I see it's the life autography of willy the wonka god of chocolate
Wrong. Wonka should be English.
WONKA or WOKA ?
I’ve always wanted an origin film of the 1971 movie. Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory.
"Those first few lines from timothee really did not sound natural. I'm sorry, I think he's great at serious roles, but I felt like he was doing an impression throughout this rather than his own interpretation."
I was rolling my eyes until Hugh Grant started dancing. Ticket sold.
Bring back Henry Cavill
Great Hollywood ruins another movie…….
People call me a wonka 😆
Isn’t that the same mom 1:51 from Johnny Depps version 🧐
bad acting detected    what a shame
"Ah, this is going be GREAT in the box office"
Idk....looks awful
"Oh God, why can't they just leave this Movie alone.   If you are going to keep changing it then at least stick a little more closely to the Book.   This Actor is trying to copy Depp's version not good.   The one with Gene Wilder still the Best.  Every time they re-make a Movie now, it gets worse."
wheres the children that became blueberries
"Timothy ChamaLamaDingDong ain't never gonna fill Wilder's shoes. NEVER! And yes, I could've cast this role much better."
"its gonna be a big maybe for me, really excited about the direction and production team"
No because the only reason I’m going to watch this is because Timothée Chalamet is in it
Doesn't anyone have an original idea? The first Willy Wonka was brilliant. The Depp version missed the mark. Now this? WB blew it with the super heroes and this reeks of desperation. Such a waste of truly talented actors.
Is he a young Gene Wilder wonka or Johnny Depp wonka ?
I am so excited to watch this in theaters❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Well, it doesn't exactly look charming or weird, which is what made the original so good. And I don't think TC feels right at all for Wonka. But I do love Paddington... so I'll give it a chance I guess."
to see mr bean in an elevator and made by paddington im watching this
That timothy is not a professional actor . Cuz his mom is jewish now we see him everywhere . Sorry i have nothing against jew people i have already jewish friends . So plz stop making untalented people as amazing actors .
Big chocolate HATES him!
I’m glad Gene is gone. This should be a crime.
The Oompa Loompa scene is what made this trailer. I now care about this film.
Mark my words this will go viral ❤😮 1:57
"I can't believe it... there's a movie at the ""dropping trailers"" stage that sounds like I DO want to see it! I think that last time that happened was Bumblebee..."
The cast is fire
Only a day & it’s at 11 million views
Oh i would love to watch this 😮 1:38
«Жопка»
Have I gotten old… this looks dumb
Nope.
Johnny's performance will be hard to top. Let's see how this one goes.
This looks Fun and daydreamy a good escape from reality which we all need can’t wait to see this at Christmas
te quiero mucho Timothée Chalamet
This looks way better than the last Charlie and the chocolate factory movie.
A third Willy Wonka? Really? Probably too woke.
Wow I love it
"Timothee is a great actor and i loved dune and the king, but I am for some reason not vibing with this role of his. could be just me, it looked too superficial for my taste, idk."
"""Here we go mama"" give me chills ✨"
"So, how hard is this one going to flop?

Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is hilarious I must admit."
Of course they would put a black girl in that role even though no one except a black man would ever date one😂😂😂😂
What do you mean willy wonka isn't a YouTuber called mr beast
"This just seems a bit too cheery. 
Willy Wonka, as far as how he is portrayed in the novel and original movie, is a bit of a dark fellow.  Which is why Gene Wilder was cast in the original film. As one of the producers said in regards to Wilder:
""He had the sardonic, demonic edge that we were looking for.""

We also know by the time ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" takes place, Wonka is a recluse that has shut himself away in his factory after firing his entire staff (except for the Oompa Loompas). 
So how do we go from this way too optimistic Wonka to the one that is met by Charlie?"
"Way to go WB, wrecked another classic movie."
why do i want johnyy to play this role
This movie looks good
Soooooo how many wonka is this now 4 ffs let's see how woke this is
"Alright, guess I'll be the one to say it




Timothee feels and looks miscast."
Hopefully better than the previous rubbish movie of Wonka and his chocolate factory many years ago.
"Looks like a good movie for me.
I grew up with the Roald Dahl books during my childhood, and have read all the books with exitement.
The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory book is one of my favourite books, and it has given me thoughts on how it had been if the chocolates in the books was real stuff.
Now that the two movies from 1971 and 2005 with Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp has given their magic out, we get the story of how Willy Wonka became the chocolate maker every fan has read about.
I bet there still a fan or more who want's to get exited to see this one as a christmas present before the holidays.
I will for sure grab some sweets and see it for myself."
"The cgi looks bad,the first sonic trailer level bad."
хуйлонка
Im so happy that this is coming back! 🥰
Is this still the same universe as Snowpiercer?
This looks so bad lmfao
It looks bad
Hopefully it will cover the harrowing experience that turned him into a human being hating narcissistic
Im sick of looking at black people
JOHNSON!
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
This looks so boring
A 3rd Wonka movie awesome
Olivia Colman! She's superb.
Every good thing in this world started with a dream... so now I'm dreaming of a chocolate bar. 😂
*IF YOU LIKE WONKA HIT THAT LIKE BUTTON*
"And here we go. A fan service that captures a well-known character to create an idol effect, with diluted elements of great franchises, in this case, Alice in Wonderland (?), Mary Poppins (?) and an aesthetic and lazy recycling of Fantastic Beasts (?) with a repeated plot, bland, full of special effects, characters without charisma or personality and cliches. Nothing new here. The trailer ends with the exact last scene being an easter egg and considerably gross. They really no longer try to camouflage the play of attracting an audience by memory and not by quality. And it really works."
"I wanna watch this movie NOW!!!. Did Road Dahl write a prequel book to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Trilogy? There were two books I remember ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" and its sequel ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator."" I don't remember there ever being a prequel to this."
MrBeast Wonka video about to go even more bonkers!
🤷🏾‍♂️
Oh dear.  Yet another beloved character to ruin.
No. 
2005
"So since Roald Dahl died in 1900, I guess the copyright is free now.

Good.

Sadly, you folks have decided to make Wonka into an approachable 20-something, rather than the reclusive, creepy, and somewhat menacing figure we've come to know.  Now, I'm not gonna whine about Hollywood raping the corpses of dead-IP (though you are).  And I'm not gonna whine about you folks substituting CGI for plot/substance (though I'm pretty sure that applies here too).  What I am gonna whine about is the absolute lack of testicular-fortitude here.  You could have taken Wonka and explored his darkest aspects, made a thought-provoking piece that leaves viewers questioning the nature of humanity...instead you made a bunch of CGI-fueled dance-numbers with a man-child who looks like he just recently discovered thrift-shopping. 

I'm sure you'll make a lot of money from disappointed adults, and children who don't know any better.  But nonsense like this is why film is dying.  It's not piracy.   It's not COVID...it's your lack of ingenuity; it's your lack of vision."
"Wonka had always been an eery character. Always a step over the line. A little mysterious. This version just looks like a silly whimsical kid. I can’t see a boy like the one in the trailer turning into the sort of scary awkward adult that is Wonka. Makes me apprehensive of this movie, but maybe the trailer just didn’t capture the character’s persona all the way? Idk how I feel about it."
"I think I heard them announcing this movie a while back and I was actually annoyed by it, but seeing this trailer makes me really excited about it"
Charlie and lady dark chocolate
This looks so good! Can't wait!
Its a bit much
Movie looks terrible. Tom Holland could’ve played this role better
The hype I vot for Henry the V on netflix has the same level of hype for this! Fkn get in Timmy boy❤
The actor I’m most excited about in this whole damn cast is Mathew Baynton ❤️❤️❤️
Is this the prequel?
Who's wonking there willys now
i absolutely CANNOT wait
"i’ve been anticipating the day this trailer would be released sind this movie was first announced, by the looks of it, the long wait definitely didn’t disappoint! i can’t wait to see this in theaters, and perfectly timed during the holidays, after dune: part 2! 🤭"
Honestly this looks dumb.
I hate this wonk....... Bring back Johnny depp ❤
I always love when a good movie comes out around Christmas and this really looks great. Timothee Chalamet along with an all star cast…..can’t wait to see it!!!
"YA'LL GOT ROWAN ATKINSON IN A WILLY WONKA MOVIE?
I AM SOLD!"
"To see Timothee Chalamet sound so goofy and quirky, makes me laugh! I mean in Dune and other things I see him, he seems so serious and reserved. This is whole different view of him and I like it! It looks so cute with the music playing in the background and seeing all the colors, musical numbers! Perfect Christmas movie!!"
Who knew HG as an Oompa Loompa was exactly what we needed?? 😆
This looks absolutely awful.
I wish one was made based on the 2010 Willy Wonka with Johnny Depp. That way it tell more about his childhood. We know his father but not his mother
I really felt when willy said it's wonkin time!!!
"This is the British crossover we never knew we needed. We've got Mathew from Horrible Histories, Rowan Atkinson from Mr Bean/ Johnny English and Hugh Grant from Paddington!!"
Looks amazing...brilliant...and I'm 60!
"I -almost rolled my eyes at yet another movie that will be riding brand recognition all the way to profit, but it actually looks delightful and that it will be a happy edition to the Wonka lore."
Thank you for giving me a reason to was the new flash movie
"I can't wait for this! It feels like a prequel to the Gene Wilder movie (I liked the Johnny Depp one too, but Wilder was on another level as Wonka), and it gives me vibes of Mary Poppins meets The Greatest Showman! My only hangup is that Wonka said ""Scratch that, reverse it"" instead of ""Strike that, reverse it"", but that's a tiny nitpick. This looks great!!!"
betta than johhny depp  !    sorry johnny
I’m ready for the Willy Wonka: Into the Wonkaverse. Need that Johnny Depp and 2pac’d Gene Wilder action!!
I didn't know Timothee could smile
2:06 Homunculus?
"Am I the only one that thinks this doesn't look great? And I want it to be! I love Timothee, but from what I see here, he just doesn't have the intensity or weird charisma that I associate with Wonka. I hope I'm wrong."
"I’m very impressed with Timothy Chalamet, he really became Wonka. However, I’m not sold on the writing or overall look and feel of this film from this trailer. We will have to see!!"
This looks retarded 😂 That actor is all wrong for Willy Wonka. Wonka is an old man not a young 20 something. 😂😂😂😂 Warner bros ruining Willy Wonka. Gene Wilder is rolling in his grave.
Bot campaign.
Ok..this looks better than I thought it would
"Well... as someone who read the books and watched both versions of the Chocolate Factory, I have mixed feelings. But, I like how Timothy Chalamet isn’t trying to be either Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp and is putting his own spin into the character. Just the right amount of whimsy, though I'm wondering if this film will end with him closing the factory and then alluding to his famous (or infamous, if you're Augustus Gloop) tour and the Golden Ticket!"
"Ever since that disturbing ""Call Me By Your Name"" movie having a teen-age Chalamet being sexually seduced by a 30-year-old Armie Hammer...I just can't get pumped about any movie that kid stars in. And I'm sorry, but WONKA? It's already been butchered by Tim Burton. Looks like we're going for seconds."
Is that...Johnson from Peep Show?
"Great, more garbage I won't watch."
I can't wait
Yep Another remake 🤡
Жопка
"Just after seeing him dark, dreadful, and dreary in Dune and now bright, bubbly, and brilliant in Wonka is a huge whiplash. I actually believe he's a different person in this. That's impressive, nowadays. Glad he wasn't typecast!

I also like how they're leaning hard into fantasy!!"
who wonkin they willy rn?
Paul needs to lay off the spice
Pathetic
"Terrible fake English accent, random token black child shoehorn in for no reason… this film is going to be dogshit."
Willy foakin‘ Wonkah
"Looks absolutely pathetic... Johnny Depp had a fun take but , it wasn't WILLY WONKA. This guy watched the Tim Burton movie and was like ""boom, I'll nail this"""
"When they were shooting in Bath, a snowy scene near the waterfall i was on a first date with a girl that i married later on 😊. Something for us to remember."
They just couldn’t leave the franchise alone could they. All of these woke remakeitblacks are getting stupidly out of hand.
oh 16 seconds in and I can already tell where this is going.
Ooh this is just wonderful. I’ll be looking forward to this one very much
Is this before Bruce Wayne parents are killed or after?
Nobody asked for this. And chamelet is so 2019. Who TF cares for this movie?
AYYYY NOW CHOP
not Chalamet why
"Ain't it hilarious how them ""anti-woke"" folks are those that get triggered just from seeing a black person on screen. Obligatory what a time to be alive."
It's.... a little underwhelming. Seems to never leave the town. And the little helper girl makes no sense.
Another Willy wonka movie
I’m surprised timothee knows how to wear a hat ngl
Where is Jack Sparrow?
"Bro, Wonka be looking like Daniel Thrasher 😂😂😂"
"Rather than being creative and making new IP's, you're adament about ruining classics.

Way to go warner 👏 I sincerely hope this is a flop at the box office. You'll deserve every penny lost."
This just seems like another one of the many uninspired pieces of shlock Hollywood has put out over the last decade.
"Respect to everyone that searched for ""wonka trailer"" and decided to click the Warner Bros. Pictures!!"
I just watched the entire movie
What a terrible movie the original is so much better.
"Looks made for a ""modern audience.

I'll stick with the original thanks."
I was a little hesitant when I heard news about this movie but honestly after seeing the trailer I am now excited! I love how whimsical and fun this seems but it still has a serious note as well
Oh he’s American now? Cool. 😔
"Why, God why"
JFC come up with something new for once
Diversity hire of course xD
"this looks good, and even tho this actor looks like a teenager I know he’s probably older than me lol"
I feel like I won't mind the musical numbers in Wonka.
Am I the only one that thinks Timothy just isn't great? Could've casted better
I'm shocked Wonka wasn't race swapped
looks boring
It's like they combined the whimsical nature of Paddington with the showmanship of The Greatest Showman... looks amazing
"Every new Wonka movie makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory look better and better, good on WB for keeping the classics alive!"
MATHEW BAYNTON
"I was enjoying this until I saw that bellend Hugh Grant, that's put me right off watching this! ☹"
"Once we start watching, we can’t stop! 🥰🥰🥰"
"'Here we go mama........' 😊😊😊, this scene is enough to watch this movie"
It's hard not to measure every Willy Wonka performance against Gene Wilder's take on the character. Looking forward to seeing Timothee's version!!
Was that Marion Moseby?
"Ooooh, definitely gonna watch this."
Is this prequal
"Let's be honest. Gene wilder killed it so much, no one will live up to Wonka!"
Peaceful!
I never thought Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa would be the best thing I'd ever seen until now!!
Animation looks bad... but will watch only for Timothée Chalamet
IS THAT TIMOTHY CHALAMET????
Waner brothers finally i live them making movies wuhuu
You changed his hairstyle
Every Big thing in the world started with a dream
I’ll definitely prefer this one over the Tim Burton directed one any day
Rowan Atkinson caught my eye
"where's Zendaya?
I'm confused..."
Cool another wonka movie
This trailer almost made me cry🥹
Mr bean sighting
"Super down for this, so long as it respects the story's future, by leading toward the original plot and isn't charlie erasure by introducing characters that would be inheritors of the factory."
Tim sounds too depressed to play this role
Amazing idea
of course it’s timothee😒
0:08-0:13 That's probably my favorite line in the whole thing. It reminds me so much of Gene Wilder.
"The way he talks and move doesnt feel like Willy at all, it seems forced"
"I know it's nothing like the book, but the original film is unbeatable!!"
This new movie should be illegal
Alright
"usually a bit suspicious of origin stories, but this has the cast and support to be a banger, as well as an actual intriguing backstory in the original"
trash
"The usual woke, pc, box ticking nonsense. Shame."
Yeah im sick of hollywood theres no originality
Hollywood straight outta ideas huh
"lmao ""once we started we cant stop"". all in all, i hope is movie is good, im ready to be blown away"
At least Willy Wonka’s still white
I don't remember this episode of house
I’m gonna cry
ew
"Am I the only one who thinks this role doesn’t really fit him,"
looks good
Oh Yeaaaaaah ! 
"TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET, EVERYONE!!😩 I geuinely believe they did a great job with the casting, considering his versatility in acting and from the judgement of his silly quirky expressions that portrays Willy Wonka at its best by just this one trailer; not every famous young actors these days can play this type of character well. Not to mention the director of Paddington and the producers of Harry Potter, who made me gain trust in this movie and look forward to it even more - literal icons. Plus, timing this at Christmas is just *chef kiss🤌🏻🤍*"
this is legit anotehr great willly Wonka content!!!!
Trash
"Isaiah 47:11 No S'AT&TAnniku ""Satanic Reversals!""  Kappah Arurs?  Copro? Corporate? ""Kaffi'"" Corps?  Kappa? Xyper?  Xyy Pir?.  WUB?  Camay?   ;93."
Why does Willy wonky look like and sound like Daniel Thrasher
"Na seriously I thought that this movie was a prequel to the 2005 movie but it has nothing to do with it, also it shows that the movie is located in the 1920s or 1950s This movie looks more like a prequel to the 70s movie"
No.
David Tennant would make a better Willy Wonka
So Willie Wonka is actually a Wizard… from the world of Harry Potter… makes so much more sense now
Looks stupid af
"Hes a good actor, but I just don't think Timothy fits into any of the big roles he's been cast for. Just a little off. The movies still work though!"
This looks terrible. Terrible casting choice
"""Once we've started we can't stop.""
That explains a lot"
"Yes, call me Maria chocolate yes, we all want to return from the dead head pepperoni😍"
Couldn't be much worse than the versions Johnny Depp destroyed.
Musical
El umpa lumpa en cgi se va a cargar la pelicula
Just kinda hate that this look like fantastic beasts
"Wow, its like a worse version than the original, BUT with a bunch of blacks added for no reason!! Super cool, jewish execs at WB!!!"
This is one of the dumbest concepts of 2023. How stupid that he is a master before becoming a master... seriously. the entire premise of Willa Wonka and the Chocolate factory is that he was a crazy inventor / candy maker who was working on new insane magical innovation in his factory.. the idea he had flying / floating candy at this point is just plain lazy
You could have casted the guy from The Bear......
Director of Paddington? Hot damn this looks good! Worried about the release date tho. Some big hitters in there.
Que sea la precuela de snowpierce. Por favor
This looks exciting
Hm. I believe in timmy but i was hoping to see a quirky british boy. Something like doctor who
this movie looks amazing and Timothy fits in with Willy wonka so much
I didn’t think Paul Atreides would be making chocolate after wandering into the deserts of Arrakis
"The bots have truly taken over this comment section.

 “Well if it’s from the director of paddington, it’s gotta be a masterpiece 🥴!”"
Why
that just looks delightful
where is johnny depp ?
Another Willy Wonka that doesn't have a British accent even tho the man is literally from England
Ugh nooooo
Come with me to a world of purrreee imagination
MATTHEW BAYNTON AND ROWAN ATKINSON?? THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE
Ugh
Timothée is a genius.
"They even got the Numberwang contestants, incredible casting."
this bouta be cringe
The jokes just flat out are not landing for me...
Where is the group of kids?? 🥺🥺🥺
Oh dear.
Hollywood coming up with another original idea.
Why does this movie keep being remade? Just do a stage play if everyone wants a turn acting and directing it. Movies are more definitive…
Christmas has come early. Looking forward to this one. 🎅🎅🎅🎅🎅
"Literally in tears,it's Perfect❤"
I love this so much kids will definitely love this too
Small chocolate
"Yea not exactly sold on this kids performance on being willy wonka but since it has keegan and mr bean, i will go watch it."
this is gonna be absolutely terrible casting that twink as wonka is a huge mistake
Nice and woke.
Who up wonkin they Willy?
Isn't this film gonnaa be pg or pg-13 im confused
There are no BLACK people in willy wonka. Stop making everything woke!
Why do we need this? Why not make something new?
"A bad passing film will be released again. The whole charm and interest of Wonka was that it was a mysterious character. And here it is not clear why they made a prequel, it is not clear what the film will be about. Tim Burton's film showed a chocolate factory and children. Is Willy Wonka a magician here? Why do people fly? Wonka is a chocolate engineer, so where's the chocolate? Where are his sweets?"
Looks promising but can’t help but to think it’s just another greatest showman rip off
Yea I don’t know about this 😭
This is just a personal opinion but Timothee Chalamet's doesn't capture the spirit of Willy Wonka and idk how to feel about Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
"It's just the mad hatter selling sweets!
Oh they use the old ompalompas design 😮"
Willie Wonka and chocolate factory
Wow this looks so nah.
"I already thought the movie looked fun, but Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa has me convinced to go."
"I love how it seems as a origin story, I also love how it will be out for Christmas such perfect timing. ❤"
What’s the point? Tim Burton already made this & it was incredibly faithful to the source material. This is just another example of a money grab factory film making.
Johny depp will always be my willy wonka.
Why we wonking the Willy again ?
Okay this totally looks like an overcooked souffle .....I think maybe just stick to the Great Gene Wilder........and the classic OompaLoompas
What a horrible idea. Even worse than the Johnnie Depp mess.
"I HATE WILLY WONKA, will never forgive him for what he did to that poor Bosnian village."
Trash
"I like Rowan Atkinson, that's it"
"This hurts somewhere deep inside. They've taken willy Wonka and went full harry Potter with him.

Part of the character I loved about the original was the slight dark...off...edge that he brought. Timothy chalemet just seems whimsical, animated and surprised by everything. 
Sad to see indeed."
Looks as boring and uninteresting as unseasoned chicken breast
❤❤❤❤
Here for Timothee  Chalamet! Finally getting the break he needs
why is his hat cgi?
"I had zero expectations before watching this, Now I am excited for this movie... This is a Beautiful looking Trailer..."
I don't think this works.
No one will ever be as iconic as Wonka than the late Gene Wilder
This was Michael Jackson's role. No one else could ever better portray a better Willy Wonka than he would have
The casting is amazing - How can I resist watching this?
"I would find this interesting if the movie ended with someone betraying him and him becoming the recluse explaining his state in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. 

That probably wont be the case though."
Hope they bring back the Wonka bars in time for the movie :D
MrBeast should do a part 2
Destined for failure. Gene Wilder is and forever will be the one and only. 💯
It just looks overproduced and as if it's piggybacking off the ideas of the original
Another sequel movie... Probably gonna flop
I love his quirkiness as Willy Wonka! Can't wait to watch the movie❤
"So what I gathered from this trailer is that this movie has nothing to do with its source material anymore. Yeah, no thanks."
So no crimes of criminal warfare? Or child murders?
and again... its woke af.
This is bad...
พดาหล ดูยังไงก็อ่านยังงี้😅
"We didn't ask for this, and yea im getting bad fantastic beast vibes"
So excited for this movie! Our family will be enjoying it this holiday for sure 😁👍💕
no one replace johnny depp willy wonka
The comment section is so sterilized it's cringe.
"Gene Wilder was whimsical in a way that felt like there was something dark behind his eyes. Johnny Depp was so whimsical it was almost cartoonish, and it’s because he was scared inside. Chalamet is just a dude trying way to hard to be whimsical"
I really want the Slugworth villain film to come out
Prequel to Snowpiercer
why did this trailer make me so emotional 😢
Mr bean was unexpected
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
"An original Wonka story, acting and time period look solid, count me in!"
Why?
Looks like a cozy film to watch this Christmas. hope it meets all the expectations
Scratch this movie and watch Sound of Freedom.
I must WATCH this movie🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰
"When I first saw this, I thought it looked good, but one thing made me not want to watch it, I thought it would be a prequel to the remake of Willy Wonka, with Johnny Depp. Which isn’t a bad movie, Johnny Depp Carrie’s it, but I like the classic one EONS BETTER. But when I saw the Orange Oompa Loompa with the Green hair, and not just a short dude, I knew it was a prequel to the classic. So now I’m DEFINITELY going to watch it"
after like 17 years from 2005 he is back.
Gene wilder will be spinning in his grave WOKE garbage
When is thiS coming out
"When i see this teaser , remember those days with Johnny Depp 😢😍"
Yeah this is definitely gonna flop. I can't wait
"Look another Willy Wanka movie , Hollywood is so creative NOT !"
Chúc mừng phim thằng bạn 95
Not really sold on Timothee Challomett
you can't be serious bruh not again 😭
"Before the video revealed the producer, I swear I said to myself ""this is giving Harry Potter vibes"" and lo and behold... 😂🤣"
"How many times are they going to re-make this horrible movie/story.  Yikes, another one?"
I've got a bad feeling about this one...
I'm pretty sure half the comments here are bots. Ain't no way folk are that excited.
Do the great glass elevator with Johnny depp.
I'm sorry but this looks awful.
Another remake without the fun or  charm of the original why does every remake have to be so serious and dramatic so sick of this. Get some original ideas
"I must say, this intrigued me greatly.  My expectations have been whetted."
Seriously you needed to remake this movie AGAIN? can Hollywood seriously not come up with any new ideas that they have to keep remaking shows/movies and doing a horrible job at remaking them I should add
Wilder’s and Depp’s were great and this one just might surprise me.
Old willy wonka is the better movie. ( Charlie fabric of chocolate )
"As Willy Wonka once said, the Chocolate must flow."
Hope this one doesn’t disappoint...
"The only thing that gives me pause is all of Willie's human companions in this. We know that in a few years? he is going to be all alone, isolated, and apparently without friends. So what happens to all these people he built his business with? That makes me want to see a sequel to the original, so we can see Willie reconnecting to some of those old friends as he rejoins society, sort of."
he is so silly
"Is Agustus gloop 
Veruca salt
Mike teeveee 
Charlie Buckaaat
Violet Baureguarde 
Cameo ..?
At least the oompas look scary unlike the trash we got back in 05’"
Uuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhh reuse remake repeat completely sucks try thinking outside the box
"Ok, it's a visual treat already ❤."
"Nonono…
“Willie Wonka” not your name…
“Call me by your name” is your name.
Timothy is actor of one role like Daniel Radcliffe - Harry Potter forever.
Timothy is those who in each movie looks like silly boy which was fckd old man. 
“Willie Wonka” is only for Johnny Depp."
"This could actually be quite fun, I'm looking forward to it. I just wish that the trailer (and so many others) didn't give soooooo much of the storyline away... Less is more, sometimes."
bro is not whimsical
When it's coming on Netflix
weird enough this looks quite charming
No…!!!! Not another timotei film.
You got me at chocolate cartel
This is just perfect and the line up is great 😊 can't wait to see it ❤
What is this trash
Timothee Chalamet looks like a young Gene Wilder.
OK I'M CRYING NOW.... THIS IS INSANE...NEVER THOUGHT TIMOTHY WOULD BE IN THIS ROLE! FEELING NOSTALGIC AND EMOTIONAL!
Ohoho I cannot wait for this!
umpalumpa 🤣
no one asked for a willy wonka prequel
"I'm not really feeling this one. Might just be the trailer not showing much of the story, but it just doesn't look like a compelling story.
I kinda expected more of an underdog angle, with the struggle to break into this market that's dominated by these monolithic companies. But it seems more like he just decides to do it, and then everything subsequently just works for him."
THE CHOCOLATE CARTEL😂
"I wanna say this looks good, but that would be a lie. But Paddington was good, so who knows…"
I hope it does not become a hour long slop I have great expectations
Huh.. they copied Mr.Beast
Do people really need to bring out Disney here?
Mr. Bean 🥹🥹🥹🥹
I may give it a chance.
Yayyayayyayay! I’m so happy yay! 🥳🥳🥳🥳
Looks like it sucks how unfortunate for such a great movie character. Oh well I’m sure someone will be woke on top of everything else
"Wonka. YOU GET NOTHING. YOU LOSE. GOOD DAY, SIR!"
"Ah yes, the woke version has arrived."
"Honestly, just looks like it’s gonna be horrible…"
"0:31 OH MY-
As a MASSIVE Horrible Histories fan, I had to take a double take just make sure that was Matt Baynton.
I can't wait to see this, I always loved Matt's acting and personality."
"Please. Stop. No more drivel, it's too disheartening."
"This looks amazing, and Hugh Grant at the end gets my vote for sure."
Where is the Hispanic representation? If blacks can keep complaining about it Ima keep complaining as well until we become equal or close to it!
"I'm sorry, but that guy has the personality of a slice of white bread..."
Omg a character from the book I was in love with from childhood portraying by an actor I'm in love with now it's just too perfect
"Nope scratch that, reverse it. Is it worth it? Let me work it"
Naah bro. You guys just ruined it. Umpa lumpas don't look good. we love Johnny depp's willy wonka and chocolate factory.
"He's a good actor, I see him so much pulling off this type of character, and the story seems good. However, there's really nothing here that screams Willy Wonka so I wish they gave it a different name and followed the the direction of originality towards which the movie seems to be going."
This looks insufferable
Finally Timothée Chalamet in Kids movie 😁
"A British actor would've been MUCH better, I'm not sold on Timothée Chalamet"
"This is missing the magical feeling of the orignal.  The remake of the oringal was at least trying to recapture it, this just is missing it completely."
.... omg?
He looks handsome ❤ on that Wonka Outfit
This is the cute and pretty version for kids. Depp is the edgy a bit darker version which also caters for adults. Will see. I dont see any Wow factor. And chanfing an iconic Ompa. Will see the Cg ont this.
Жопка
This gives me Cats movie energy. I pray to God I'm wrong. 😩
After watching the tralier I remembered the wizard of oz
Why does it look and feel exactly like Cats 2019?
This looks so cool I can't wait
This movie is what Disney live action tried to be but failed.
I swear they find away to destroy all the good classic flicks 😢
never thought i’d have a crush on willy winks after the last movie-
Wonka Poppins
This will be better than Napoleon. Mark my words.
I’m just not feeling this
ANOTHER REMAKE?! MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL ALREADY!!
Chalamet can’t act
an unfortunate casting choice
Nah.
I think its hilarious that he dated depps daughter and now is playing the younger version of the same character
This looks like the perfect Christmas movie. Can't wait!
Atreides Wonka. No thanks.
"Can't touch Wilder's Wonka, there's no sense of magic here"
Shoe-horning Africans in England in an era when they were not part of English culture of that era? ✓
From the creative minds of The Mighty Boosh. If Noel Fielding isn't in it. This is gonna flop and not be worth watching.
"I wasnt feeling this at all, then “Too late, I’ve started dancing now. Once we start we can’t stop.”"
Ooff.
"I am 50/50 on whether I like this or not.  The movie is creating an origin story for a beloved character, that usually fails every time.  Plus as much as I love Timothee Chalamet in many films, I am not liking his performance in Wonka.  He isn't bad, but it feels like the absurdness he brings comes across as forced and not natural to the character.

I could be wrong, but at best it will be a good fun movie, but not memorable.  Maybe a 6/10."
Not to be THAT person but why is Wonka American-
"This film seems too perfect to be true. Starry cast all perfect for their roles, directed and produced by big names who created critically and financially successful films in the past few decades, and a timeless story that's still held dearly by children and adults alike around the world. Hopefully this hype will be well-deserved once the film comes out!"
I’m sold!
0.2 seconds in so far... Do we really need another movie based on the children's novel?
"Change every ""chocolate"" with ""drug"" and movie will still make sense💀"
No dad as the dentist ? When was he ever an orphan?? 😮 my god this movie makes Zero sense is you already watched Chocolate factory. It’s like they’re remaking stories for the new age kids forget about who grew up watching 😢
Just... horrible. Wonka has been miscast
"Nobody :

Random customers eating Willy’s chocolates : ""God im so high rn"""
I hate this.
MrBean can talk ?
Rowan Atkinson and Keegan? Sign me up for this
I'm not going to lie I'm genuinely not going to lie I'm not one of these but counts. this trailer actually looks interesting
Johnson. Alan Johnson. Yes.
boo this sucks
What...a new Wacky Willy?! Wanna watch Wonka with me wifey on a Wednesday!
Looks mid
Timothy  🤧🤧😘❤️
Boring...
Violet eat gum get blueberry inflation is back!
Another movie that will flop at the box office
Жопка
Ah finally a movie that everyone was asking for....
Johny deep just better and yes
Perfect casting for Wonka
"That girls chocolate black, i love chocolate black 😂"
Guess *Dune* and *Wonka* mix
"For the love of God - MAKE NEW STORIES. Stop re-imagining old classics. Your version will never be remembered like them. Here’s a secret: you know why they became classics? Because the story had never been told before. They explored uncharged territory and built something entirely new. 

The public knows that there is no shortage of talent, nor great untold stories. But your insistence on shunning both is making us lose faith. Who’s in charge at these studios? Maybe it’s time for a change."
Willy Wonka is back in our childhoods
"I love Timothee, but I think Johnny will always hold the best Wonka! I can’t wait to see this though. Awesome role to see him play lol"
why about chocolate and candy for what is Wonka films all about?
oh my god that movie looks unwatchable
"Any one else board with tinsle town right now? Because they keep remaking old stories.

How many times can they remake casablanca? and other famous movies. I've seen about 4 remakes of movies I enjoyed growing up in the past ten yrs."
"Oh! The classic Oompa Loompa! ❤ that aside, it looks charming! I hope that they also bring back the Wonka chocolate to sell in stores, those were the best"
"This shows how intellectually bankrupt you truly are. I am so tired of reboots, prequels, and franchises . But I suppose, it wasn't made for me was it."
As long as it's NOT WOKE bs I'm in.
"Honestly I think this will destroy the ominous existence of Wonka, which was kind of the whole point of his character."
IS THAT SHAWN MENDARESSJ??¿°
I really hope that this is the role that timothee finally gets his name permanently attached to.
This actually looks good!
"Looks brill but one questions why does Wonka and some of the cast have American accents they are English characters, really confusing for children and sorry I know this will offend some but myself as well . 
Anyway am sure it won’t matter once we get caught up in the joyful magic of the film x looking forward to it , as am a big Dahl fan xx"
Rowan Atkinson better be more than just a man that says “run away !” And then never to be seen again or I’m gonna be heated🤣
Now i get it! this is the aliexpress version of johnny depp's wonka right ?
Alan Johnson monopolising the confectionery market is the final stage of Project Zeus.
Looks too cutesy and watered down for my taste. Huge fan of the original with Gene Wilder.
First The Little Mermaid now this..............Woke remakes have a history of failure. Just give it up already.
I AM A CHOCOLATE MAKER
OMG not again! So tired of Hollywood these days. May the writer's strike continue until a new generation or actually talented people emerges.
JOHNSON??
Wow I can’t believe I made it 11 seconds through this hogwash. Miss me with this clown show.
"Nobody is going to like me for saying this, and I don't care, but this seems like it leaves a lot to be desired. Especially since nobody can come close to Gene Wilder's Wonka"
just no
Can’t wait🎉
Looks interesting. Definitely will need to check this movie out.
"Oh look, ANOTHER IP from the past to be dug up by a studio so they can inject woke politics into so it ""updated for a modern audience"" and moved to be more in line with the sensibilities of the west."
I guess only black people are allowed to be anachronistic minorities in movies with historical settings… weird how they seem to be 25% of the population of 1900s England
"Can Hollywood make original movies and stop sucking the life out of everything done already?  Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka, this is hot garbage."
"So nostalgic, Wonka and bean. Just thinking if the trailer had started with Mr Bean, how funny it would have been.🤣"
Black people in 1900s london ?
Ждем Вилли Жопку с нетерпением!
Make original movies please.
Miscast on Timothy. Doesn’t fit.
"Ain't no way im walking into a theater and saying ""Can I get a ticket for 'Wonka'"". Thats wild"
"This actually looks... really good... I really hope it ends up being good, here's to hoping at least! I'd give it a watch nonetheless!"
Jhonny Depp’s Wonka is gonna take some beating.
This is going to be amazing!! 🎉🍫🍬🍭
Okay So In a Little excited 😮
Probably going to be the best holiday movie this year.
Rotten Tomatoes score prediction: 47%
Why do they keep ruining great movies with these trash remakes smh gen z alway find ways to make things worst and worst smh
I remember when Timothée Chalamet was in Oxford and took over one of our libraries
Timothy chalamet is a yes for me
Who is missing Johny Deppp
"FACT: All special effects displayed in this moving picture were achieved solely with the use of creatine.

Now THAT's the delicious treat that truly deserves a feature-length ad I mean movie"
Looks more like Willy Woke and the Chocolate factory.
Whaaaaaaaaaat?
No one can replace the original Willy Wonka #JohnnyDepp
OMG yet another remake this industry is dead
"Another retelling of a beloved story.. Hopefully this one is good. Love the idea of Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa, but i'm sure someone will have something to say about how it should have been an actual midget and not a CGI Hugh Grant.

Here's to hoping this is good."
Johnson!
Hugh Grant being an Oompa Loompa just killed me lol. If anyone didn't want to see this movie before they should see it now. Hugh Grant is an Oompa Loompa is hilarious.
Am I the only one not convinced by Timothees portrayal of Willy wonka?
"Johnny Depp did it better, but a prequel is an awesome idea"
"I respect what they're trying to do with this new and more fantasy approach. But Gene Wilder's version of Willy wonka is still my absolute favorite and preferred. This is just too magical and extra, and I was hoping to see a more realistic origin"
"Hollywood is Dead
They are so uncreative"
If mr. Wonka was this handsome all I would ever eat would be chocolates
This feels stiff
Black people?!? Waahhhhhhh woke!!!!!! Wahhhhhhhh woke woke woke wo wo wo woke a woka
Not everything needs a origin story
The first part is the first part no one can beat the first part
i wish iwas like you.esily amused
I can't wait 😄😊
"Woke ,woke and Woke !!! This movie will also end up in trash !!!"
from the director of paddington....sheet were screwed
"I was hesitant as a Gen Xer, not wanting my original messed with at all lol but I had a huge smile on my face the entire trailer. Plus it's Timothee Chalamet ffs I've not seen him mess up one roll and he seems perfect for this one."
What a trailer! excitingggg and perfect for Christmas!!!
I don't think I like it...
I think i was at the studio where they was filming this
Only Jhonny depp 😢
"This would be a good movie for kids andd teenagers. Personally, this isnt my cup of tea"
The Chocolate must flow.
Looks horrible
"Rowan Atkinson is here!!!!! Idk even know why is he here , but i am way more hyped for Rowan Atkinson!!!!!"
"Honestly, this looks better than it should. I mean, it's the people who made Paddington, so that shouldn't be a surprise"
This movie looks like it will be a catchy musical 🎶 ❤️🍫😌
Ehh it just better be good grew up with johnny fell so hopefully this is just as good
"Looks so much promising!!
Looking forward to it"
This quite literally will be the perfect movie for Christmas
"Can someone please please PLEASE deep fake Lucas Jade Zumann instead of Chalamet???
I just feel he'd be even better"
I think Johnny Depp would be a good willy wonka too
i want him to call me mama
❤❤❤ 🎉🎉🎉
I never expected them to make a prequel of the prequel to Snowpiercer
"""Nothing to see here, just a group of people defying gravity"" 

The meme potential!! 😂"
Absolutely 💯 great #quotesuniverse
"I was REALLY suspicious about this film when the news dropped like a year ago, and was thinking, "" oh God this is gonna be a disaster!"" Because I thought it was going to be like those live action Disney movies.. But Paddington and Paddington  2 are masterpieces! And one of my favorite movies of all time!
It also has the Harry Potter producer too!! Which you can't go wrong with.

I'm definitely pretty hype for this movie. I'm a huge fan of the original Gene Wilder movie, And I think that they capture some of that essence in the trailer. 
We need wholesome movies like this! It's about time.. ♥️♥️♥️ 
It would be awesome if we could go back to making FUN whimsical and magical movies that were around in the '90s and '80s like Matilda, the page master, or something♥️ 
Anyways I'm so hyped for this!!!!"
So is he still a serial killer?
thanks for ruining a classic.
"This will be an entrance to a World of Pure Imagination.
It’s best to hold your breath, make a wish, and count to three…"
Why is there a little girl in this?I thought Wonka was a loner outcast just focused on his chocolate...
Why is every company leeching off their own movie 💀
Im miss johny depp❤
Wow I can't wait for it
This looks like an AI trailer lol
I really hope this version will finally address the unfair wages cacao producers have had to suffer for centuries.
Woke remake.
This is definitely not Willy Wonka but it’s interesting
"Unnecessary, but I can't deny it looks funny and charming. I'm going to give it a chance!"
"As a recent father, this will be amazing to watch with my kid :P"
Love This ❤
With so many great stories that have never been brought to the screen…why are we doing this AGAIN?!?
"Loved the Tim Burton Charlie and The Chocolate Factory movie with Johnny Depp, this new Wonka movie looks to capture that same magic, excited 👏👏👏👏👏🍫"
Fun fact Willy Wonka is the devil…
This is going to be a classy classic. Love that it seems to be an origin story.
I'm something of magician myself
This looks... so bad.
No hate to this revamped Willy Wonka but It just still feels weird to see Willy Wonka but not the face of Johnny Depp’s as he just made it Hitsorically Iconic
seeing the trailer I think Warner has something created which will will be good for the box office...
"Tim has the look and visually its hits the nail on the head, BUT!!! can Tim pull it off?  ehhhhhhhhhh..  Depp did a great job imo..  and No one has topped Gene Wilder.   soo time will tell."
My entire childhood in one video(
What are there Pronouns?
Warner bros never  disappoint us 🤗❤️
Timothe Chalemet isn't selling me as a good actor from this trailer
Why does timothee sound like those dorky cringe white knights who wear fedoras and say “actually”
"dune, wonka"
Omg omg omgggggg
OMG THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AND TIMOTHY CHALEMET AS WONKA OMG HE WAS BORN FOR THAT ROLE! AND ITS A MUSICAL!! I AM SO FREAKING STOKED
This looks like it's going to have the magic of the first film combined with what the Tim Burton movie wanted to do but failed miserably to do it.
Did I just see..Mr. Bean??
"The trailer felt quite wholesome, then Hugh Grant came on and I burst out laughing. 🤣😂"
Great job technicaly very strong this story...
Charlie and the chocolate factory.
This looks absolutely wonderful. I can't wait to see it.
This looks so woke and horrible
This is so bad xD
"Sorry, still Gene Wilder is the best, by a long way"
"""Directed by Paul King"" Oh thank goodness, I thought it said Paul Feig for a second."
Another one of these?
Stay with the Original
Golden ticket fans…where are y’all ?
Dire.
I might actually see this one.

"Wonka works as a character because of the inherent mystery that surrounds the character. Gene Wilder knew this, and played into it with his performance. Gene's Wonka is somehow childlike and whimsical, yet also extremely enigmatic - at times even quite sinister. Understanding where Wonka came from (his origin story) doesn't develop his character in any meaningful or interesting way. This was a massive mistake with the Tim Burton adaptation, and I maintain that it is entirely the wrong decision for the direction of this script."
Looks forgettable
Oh my
"I've been hyping it up with the #BlueBeetleBattalion all morning, and man it was so worth it."
Yes! I’m excited for this! I can tell this is going to be absolutely insane as Willy Wonka said it in the trailer himself and I’m going to love it!
i am now interested in checking this out
"LOL  such woke nonsense.   Jolly olde England is blacker than Harlem.   You leftist writers are INSANE.
BOMB.   Hollywood is so dead artistically.   Nothing looks real anymore to draw you into the escape.   
Just woke leftist propaganda."
Yeeeeesssssss
Wow amazing 😍😮❤️🔥🔥
People will watch garbage... Next they will make a movie about hulk's half step sister's disabled uncle's son and people will be amazed... People are stupid..
Mono Wonka
Actually Willy Wonka's dad was a dentist and Willy was forbidden to have any sweets and he gained all his magic from unforgiveness.
Is he done acting dune?😂
Not that I'm complaining but essentially this is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Harry Potter. Or at the very least this is the story of a candy shop’s origin in the wizarding world.
Christmas???? Whyyyy
"Bro I freaked out when I saw Mr. Bean, I am very excited"
"Can’t hold a candle to Gene Wilder. Also he just copied Johnny Depp’s voice for the character. Looks awful/unoriginal tbh. Is this Willie Wonka or The Greatest Showman? 

Only good part was the Hugh Grant oompa loompa"
Visual Effects from Framestore? Oh im so ready god the killing it right now
T H E  C H O C L A T E  C A R T E L
"This proves beyond a shadow of doubt, THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN HOLLYWOOD BUT CRAPPY REMAKES and REBOOTS, there is no talent nor creativity anymore."
"Производство шоколада выглядит не по технологии, но я бы оценил его качество.

Не, перед этим, я бы прочитал отзывы. Отзывы от других дегустаторов в инете =)"
10 million views in a day is absolutely insane!!!!
"Junk. You DONT have to understand Willy Wonka. Wonka is meant to mystery and your  only be understood through the eyes of a young person trying to keep hold of the wonder of youth. 
This movie will flop. It's worst than the Johnny Depp I have daddy issues"
Can we have new ideas please?
"Sorry to be a party pooper, but chocolate and sugar are really bad for your health. This movie looks like one big advertisement..."
Sheesh making over this film agin 🤦🏽
"Yo, is this Santa Claus is coming to town? Cause it looks like the same story."
"looks a little too heartwarming, where is the edge of the original character"
Please stop remaking movies!! I need money hit me up ive got plenty of original ideas
Alright Timothee! I hope you make us proud!
When you reboot a movie from 2005 you know that something is screwy
"Jitterbug 
Jitterbug 
Jitterbug 
Jitterbug…

This trailer should use this song 😉"
"I take it this is not a direct prequel of Tim Burton's version. Although I argue that it's paying homage of the classic, while being its own thing."
Who wonking they willy's right now
"Stop remaking movies Hollywood and turning movies into TV series! How about originality? Oh, wait. You're Hollywood. You can do whatever you want. 😢"
Love Thimothee Chalamet❤
"I thought the fake views and comments on this were egregious, but then I saw that the ""The Nun II"" trailer had 22M views being 6 days old"
I like the old one just by looking at this
"I don't like it, but I'll watch it none the less."
WB is on
It feels like Directed by Wes Anderson and Produced by Greta Grewig 🎥
"No one will do this role better than Johnny Depp, unfortunately"
this dune sequel looks like an interesting take on the story
Omg 🤦🏻‍♀️
*Daniel thrasher????*
bro mr. bean is here
More woke trash for the pedophiles
Now *that* is a proper Christmas movie 😁
#HughGrant as an #OompaLoompa??? Seriously??  #SomebodyLostTheirMind
Loving the bristish casting in this
I can’t wait to relive my childhood in a whole new way!
"He must be one heck of an actor. I've never seen a Jew get a lead role in a big budget, Hollywood production."
So The studio made willy wonka origin story how  he made chocolate factory
yet another WOKE shoved.
I wasnt super into this when I heard about it but this actually looks really good.
"Is this a supposed prequel to Johnny Depp’s Version, or Gene Wilder’s supreme version?"
I really hope this turns out good
Why are people still allowed to make movies
"First 13 seconds were such terrible acting that I couldn't go on.

I'm out"
So very very woke box ticking to a new level
I can't wait
he mix chocolate with dmt😂
"What a cast,, amazing. 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫"
this is gonna be so bad i'm beyond excited
ew
"Looks absolutely terrible, he's not Wonka, a silly mess."
This wonka bar is not as sweet as JD'S
"Фильм про чёрный шоколад, но негров слишком много"
"From the producers of HARRY POTTER, oh this is dream come true! No demontors for us! 🍫"
"Wait, #WillyWonka is in #DUNE2 and it is a musical, as he rides the Giant #SandWorms? #ThatsJustWrong"
This looks amazing 💪💪💪😇
1:40 WAIT A MINUTE! Wheres the Teddy bear
No.
<3
"Ok i see retconning already. Shocked. Like the fizzy 
Lift drink. Something he was just in process of testing for original.  Stop taking established works with established lore and adding a ""twisted prequel.""  The laziness of thinking up new untold stories. 🙂"
He wasnt willy wonka but milton hersey failed miserably like 4 times and used to not even pay for advertisment because he thought the hershey wrappers were enough advertisement
BROOOOOOOOO.
yay a new story of willy wonka and not  a  remake
"Huh, Mr.Wonka keeps getting younger"
So excited to see Mat Baynton getting the great roles he deserves!!
Amazing!
Did he just quote Missy Elliot ? Oh yeah I'm gonna go see it now😩😂
"I feel like they tried but I don't feel like they really made me believe this was how Gene Wilder's Wonka came to be. There was fantasy in Wilder's film, but this feels like it went to another level where they needed to not force association with Willy Wonka and just have Timothee play a random quirky candy maker in a new franchise. I think Timothee has the facial acting capability to match Wilder or Depp in true character acting one day, but it wasn't 100% and it really had to be in order to be Wonka. Should've just been 'candy maker movie with no association to Wonka'. Id prefer they kept some movie continuity like the general public not experiencing or knowing about the more fantastical aspects of the chocolate factory and the experimental candies vs how they just show people floating in the middle of town??? What next memory altering pixie dust? I know its fantasy but the Wilder film made it still feel in the realm of possibility vs  pure goofiness."
Captures the spirit of Roald Dahl.
yoo.. where johnny depp? not even a cameo? 😢
I am so excited for this!!!
mr bean lol
lol.
This is what Paul atreides does on his free time.
Timothee rocked it
No..
Way too many blacks for Victorian England. Of course they made Charlie a black girl with an afro!
Nope
Is this a sketch?
This looks awful
hollywood just can’t make anything original anymore.
ആശംസകൾ🎉
Another one!?!?
*MRBEAST looks a bit DIFFERENT here..* 🤔
"Please proceed with care, WB. This title and the legacy of Gene Wilder require nothing short of the greatest respect and effort."
Oompa Loompa caught me off guard 😂
Now imagine if Johnny Depp suddenly appears in the movie.
I might give this a chance because it’s so cool that they’re giving wonka an origins story but it really doesn’t look good at all. The guy playing young wonka  just comes off as really annoying
Please no
"Finnaly



A movie that I can laugh and watch"
I'm gonna watch this just for the umpa lumpas
Everything we never asked for ❤
"Im a little dissapointed tbh, Jhonny Depps wonka was very human, this one is just another mc..."
Woww woww woww!!!!!
So mat baynton really IS in the movie omg
ROWAN ATKINSON LET'S GO!
"Johnson is here, Johnson is here!"
Waiting for release
Shonky wonky would seem a better title for this bilge.
Gonna be garbage guarenteed
"0:11 They brought back ""scratch that, reverse it."""
This looks absolutely breathtaking but Timothée Chalamet ain't doing it as Wonka for me
Wait! So this isn’t going to have the people going into the factory??
We don't need a willy wonka origin story. I hope this movie tanks. Sick of the same re-treading formula in big-budget movies.
"Gene Wilder had that spark/magic Timothée Chalamet just doesn't possess. Remaking the beloved classic about Willy Wonka (again) seems redundant.

I love Timothée, but instead of being the whimsical character Willy Wonka must be, Tim seems rather stiff/flat. People who say that Timothée is my generation's Leonardo Dicaprio are beyond delusional. Tim is a good actor, but he is nowhere hear Leo & probably will never be"
<3
This casting is NOT IT. Yuck
We just did not need this
"Never be better than the original.
Mr gene wilder"
"Literally no new ideas, this looks horribly cringe. This will be a 2 hour long movie, and it will bomb no one wants to watch this."
"I’ll still watch it but there’s just something about Timothee’s performance isn’t working. Specifically the goofy bits. I see the acting doesn’t feel natural. Idk, it’s just the trailer will see with the whole movie."
I need this movie like I never thought I did before.
"I love the ""So quiet up and listen down. Nope, scratch that, reverse it"" reference to Gene Wilder's ""We have so much time and so little to do! Strike that, reverse it."""
"Thanks WB. With all these shittery and wokeness around. Thankyou for keeping my childhood alive. Thanks for The batman, the flash and now this. Thanks"
STOP REBOOTING THIS MOVIE!!
"The simple fact that this is directed by the guy who did the two Paddington movies is enough to get me to watch this. Those films were absolute masterpieces of performances, storytelling and direction."
for some reason to me it feels like a walking ad like what if in the end they put some thing saying new wonka chocolate hear now and then it ends with all the credits
Garbage
I already got bored just watching the trailer😢
"At first I was very ""meh"" hearing about a new Wonka. But after seeing this trailer? YES! And Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is an unexpected bonus!!!"
Can’t wait to watch this movie. . .after the writers strike comes a end that benefits the writers 👌
Im way MORE excited to see Rowan Atkinson here lol
What the actual!! Is this a parody or something 😅 😂 somebody Zap me back to the 70s and 80s man. What a mess!!! Who even asked for a God Damn prequel?!
Missing Johnny depp
You know what the real secret to Willy Wankas success!!! Forced Slavery!!! 😃
Timothy isn’t genuinely whimsical enough for me. He comes across a dad reading to his child and trying to depict a character
Somethings off...
Aww looks like a very great spin on Wonka I’ll definitely go see it!
took 500 years for africans to figure out chocalate is mexican?... literaly told africa the church invented it?!.........  why theres no Bison on wall street?!!
"No one can compete with *Johnny Depp’s* Charlie and the Chocolate Factory,.. 🍫 🏭"
1:41 Mr. Bean spotted
Жопка здесь?
Dear God why. We don’t need this not really want this let’s all be honest. Through Willy is cute.
So wheres the girl in Charlie and the choclate factory
Ruined a classic
This looks cool! Can’t wait to watch it
Omg yes! I didn't know I needed this movie in my life until I saw this trailer! This Christmas is going to be amazing!
Looks whimsically charming. I hope it is good.
cringe and woke. yikes
Saying it right now. Hugh Grant is stealing this one!
इस दुनिया में सबसे बड़ा योद्धा मां होती है 💯💯🙏

Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka >>>>>>>>
Love it love it just hope they don’t thrash the oompas lore
Looks terrible
헉 조니뎁보다 백만배 낫다 이거 보러가야징❤ 티미는 이쁘게 늙어주세요ㅋ
Is that mr.bean 😮
i like you
Missing johnny ❤️
Johnny Depp movie is the best  ever
mary poppins vibesss
Disney where is disney.....😂😂😂😂
he lacks TONS of charisma to play Willy IMHO
This weirdly looks pretty fun
Ada vibe harry potter nya ada vibe UP nya juga + Rowan 😍
W
another woke movie nthat is going to destroi this historical IP
Did anyone actually want another Willy Wonka movie?
Хм. А карликам играть карликов - это не толерантно....
Mr bean was Big suprise
This Wonka certainly feels like a big improvement over Jonny Depp’s take on the character.
Oompa loompa!!
Is the black girl like supposed to be his sister?? Or his girlfriend or what?
Wow can’t wait to go the cinema to watch this.
Life is like a box of chocolates
Jhonny depp is a emotion! No matter what... 💗🔥
must be a prequel to Gene Wilder's Wonka. Judging frm the Oompa Loompa's appearance😍
I'm disappointed that the oompa loompa's are cg now. I also feel like they just took roles away from little people by doing this too. It's not like they cast them in different roles in the movie.
"Was that Mr. Bean?😂

Edit: Thank y’all for the likes 👍"
Can you just burn it before release? We don't need more bad Wonka movies just stop.
"Just got a glimpse of The great Jhonny Depp 🔥

Also the point to be noted this guy took over it 👍"
looks dumb
Just wow. Timothee Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka is something I didn’t know I needed. I can’t wait 😭😭😭😭
This looks like it's going to be fun to see when it comes out.
This is better than that remake from 2005
Can’t wait to see this I’m looking forward to it❤😂
Why does this even exist tho
🎉
So many “shoehorns” in this movie. 😂😂
"Not w0^ke enough,A dislike for this garb%age movie👎,where are the asian leads&non-binary gender confused actors in this movie? WB"
1:29 you can hear the a world of true imagination theme
"No one can replace Gene Wilder & all these remakes attempting to even come close to his Willy Wonka are beyond redundant. Johnny Depp did a good job and his movie was more geared towards my generation, but even I can say nothing comes close to Gene!"
I think this a new way to look at Mr. Wonka❤
Good
Что там делает негоро... Зачем???
This looks really good! It’s like an origin story very different from the original! This is going to be a big movie.
My son Mr. Bean in this?? yeah its lit
Rowan Atkinson! ❤
Wow
"I don't think I'm alone in thinking this movie is gonna be really good, or really bad. And God bless Timothee Chalamet. He has that mysterious, handsome charm that Wilder did."
Этот Шаламе как затычка в каждой дырке - надоел уже. И хватит уже совать черных в фильмы про белых!
"Definitely watching this, looks good!"
Let’s eat dem dark mint chocolates.😎
"Great trailer, great concept and plot, no hate, but Johnny Depp was , is and will be the best Willy Wonka, but I appreciate remaking these kind of movies again ad again every decade to keep the legacy and the stories alive"
Oof
"Seems way too happy, please don't tell me this is one of those films where everybody starts dancing in almost every scene like its high school musical."
they basically showed the whole movie...
Bring back Pure Imagination song. Flash Back I need it.
This looks so good but tbh my friend played Willy Wonka in our high school musical last year and she was so good I don't think I'll ever be able to fully enjoy another Willy Wonka again 😂
Skeptical
tim burton  why donnchu get him here
"And in the name of blatant diversity, inclusion, and equity……Willy Wonka gets a black girlfriend.  Because ya just can’t have an all white or all black couple anymore.  🙄"
"I don't know, the original one was organic, real feeling. The last 2 seem too fantasy"
so when does he become a murderer?
Looks shite
Mr.bean will steal the show
This will tank.
"No day dreaming😂😂😂😂
I’ll be in debt if we were charged for it😭"
"They’re working overtime to make him look like a good guy, but all this does is make me realize why he’s set out to put every other candy business out of business"
WHAT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????!?!!?!??!!
brillant trailer
This looks good . Especially for the children. Keep making stuff for the children and the teens and the world will be better I promise
Ya… this is awesome
1:52
Hard pass. Thanks
This is gonna be TERRIBLE..
"This really does look like it'll capture the essence of Pure Imagination, and i'm quite cynical about new films so this is rare :D"
Omg I want to see this!!❤
Did I hear Mr Bean actually say something?
FIRE🔥🔥🔥
Nobody can give a better performance than Jonny Depp as Willy Wonka 😭😭😭😭😭
Do we will saw a...oompa loompa dance & sing again...?😅
"They have to put these diversity hires in every movie now, don’t They  ! Like the little mermaid , spider-Man , take the White Man out ,put the little black Things in, 
It’s getting real sick, when you have to pander to an animal, They even Tried to put a black Cleopatra in,, and that didn’t go too well for them, but I do gotta say one thing, They are forgetting that they were the first ones in outer space,,, it wasn’t the White Man,,, I think his name was Chimpo the chimpanzee, yeah that’s right they were the first !"
Johnny Depp is the best..!!
So this is the prequel to the prequel of Snow Peircer right?
Can we have a Johnny Depp cameo?
No one can ever beat johnny’s Willy wonka
Timothee is the best
The casting is so chocolate coloured !!!
here we go MAMA...
God this looks terrible and pointless.
What is this..... I didn't see any Willy Wonka in here at all.
Why?
Timothee...
Wow 😳
I want to see the magic of the wonka chocolate he create
I also find it funny how one of Willy Wonka's business rivals will be played by Matt Lucas who I know best from Little Britain alongside David Walliams
What’s the point.
I'm so excited
"Dear Warner Brothers- Thank you! I have not been to the theater in years, had no interest, no desire. This film has changed all of that. Allow me to express further. I am a Creative Director, a creator of magical things. I saw your trailer last night and smiled. Then shared it with my wife, and we both laughed. I just watched it again this afternoon and literally have tears in my eyes. Happy tears, the really good kind that tells me you have struck a nerve. I feel this movie will be embraced by audiences, by families, by children, that has not happened in a long time, but since the first Harry Potter came out for Christmas in 2001. I will happily support and enjoy your movie. Thank you for capturing the magic of filmmaking again."
"Timothy Chalamet as Wonka is amazing

Paul and now Wonka, that's quite the range"
"lmao they knew to hide the dislikes

terrible."
Let’s just hope they don’t ruin it like other movies recently made😭🙏
there is something about wonka that makes me unease.. I just can´t like him.. feels like bad vibes
"Oh great, more rehashed stuff"
OMG IT'S ROWAN ATKINSON
huh…
Another version of this?  Hollywood is truly out of ideas.  Wait until this flops
Жопка
1:02 ok this is awesome that Rowan Atkinson has been cast to play the reverend
Willy Wonka's life story who didnt want this
Aaah memories bring back...
I never asked for this... but the story looks really good!
OMg
I'm getting goosebumps down my back and legs!!!!! This is not what I expected to happen.
"OMG! If there is Keegan in it, I MUST watch it haha! a big plus is Rowan atkinson heh"
"Wow this is amazing,I remembered ""Charly and the Chocolate factory"" like it was yesterday"
We always said this was set in the Harry Potter universe and now they have the same producer yayyyy
CAN'T WAIT
Who up wonkin they Willy rn
Wait did Paul put some spice in his Chocolate?
ЖОПКА
Wow does that ever look bad
Oh god another terrible TERRIBLE take on Wiley Wonka. For god sake it’s WOKE too…
I’m sick all these trailers being the exact same and this movie looks dumb.
I'm not gonna lie.... THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD!!
what is this i dont like this no
Hahaha no 👎
"Would this film to be dedicated in memory of the actors from earlier film adaptations...?  (1971) Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson, Denise Nickerson, Leonard Stone, Roy Kinnear, Dodo Denney, Ursula Reit, David Battley, Aubrey Woods, Günter Meisner, Diana Sowle, Peter Capell,  (2005) David Kelly, Christopher Lee, Liz Smith, Eileen Essell, David Morris, and Geoffrey Holder ...?"
1:03 orange teal disease strikes again
It looks amazing. He seems like Gene wilder in the original
OMGGGG
he looks 2 young to play wonka for some reason but stll looks good
C’è solo 1 WW
There’s a good chance this’ll be really stupid but maybe it’ll be fun anyways
Shoutout to the African kids picking out cocoa! THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU
You mean Wonka isn't Sean Giambrone?!?! PASS
This movie seems to be in the universe of Harry Potter.
DOBI DI DO!
"Very good job fellows throughout the 3rd sweetest patriotic longest felicitous family entertaining experience week of said surfside Summer July!! Congratulations 992% yo.🎰🎰🎰🎰🎰🍭👑Rowan Atkinson's presence in films, no matter how minor the role, brings immense joy to viewers. His comedic timing and iconic style always leave a lasting impression. I'm eagerly looking forward to this film, as it seems to perfectly capture the essence of the source material. It's a treat to witness Rowan Atkinson's talent in action once again!"
In it 💪
oof its depp's faster-wonka voice but wilder's spaced performance. what a terrible mix. shouldve hired tim burton. feels like a british tv movie OOF
I’m a little worried that Willie Wonka Doesn’t seem too quirky and weird but I guess we will see!
The age of remakes
HAI! 😀
No one can replace Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka.
Here in the UK the BBC each Christmas gets a couple of family friendly movies this looks exactly like one of those movies they would have.
Im out Timothee is in the same category as Tom Holland for me just cannot stand his face or acting
"Oh look, another woke remake to avoid."
"im already obsessed with this!! story of wonka, paddington director, harry potter producer, timothee chalamet & hugh grant!! im seated!!"
Might actually see this idk
It's not Wonka.Johnny Depp is
Another rehash of a classic movie! Nothing original out there ?
"This was partly filmed in Bath and I was strolling by on a Day where they where filming and part of the Town was under fake Snow, it felt super surreal with all the people walking around in Costumes and the fake Snow everywhere - i can't watch this movie without saying ""look, we where there"" every 5 Minutes : -)"
So this a prequel for Johnny Depps not Gene wilders Willy wonka? Correct?
"Ahh man 2023, I’m broke, defo watching this"
While this looks good.. Johnny will be my favorite Wonka. Constant remakes I see we’re going to Get.
"Damn, the cast in this film is amazing."
Great video
Thank god Timothy Burton didn’t get this and ruin it like he did Charlie and the chocolate factory
I can’t shake Johnny Depp’s portrayal of Willy Wonka.
I was waiting for this since 2022 im so excitied!!
snoooooooooooooooooooooz
Wow. Hollywood has really stop trying huh? Everything now is just reboots and remakes of animated movies. No originality.
Sheesh... 😬
ну ведь реально похоже на Жопка 😅
At the beginning it sounds as if he's reading a text
Alan Johnson!
Nice they really can’t come up with new movies nowadays. This looks like it’s gonna be dog water.
Why am i gettin all teary eyed when i hear pure imagination in this trailer 🥹🥹🥹
AND WE'LL WATCH!
Do we really need this though?
i’m makin chocolate o course
"I saw this and I said, WILLY WONKA"
Childhood movie memories
Create Roblox movie please
"I would have called it ""willy"""
I thought is gonna be fake but here it is
Mrs Bean in this film? I'm already a fan now
I want a Johnny Depp Cameo pls thx
Movies are becoming more and more unwatchable for adults.
since the first movie in 1971 and 2005 including from tom and jerry 2017 celebration of willy wonka.
Timothee as a chocolate maker 🤗
"I'll be a dissenting voice - I don't think this film looks good at all, it's given us a bunch of tired and cliche'd situations and the humour seems trite.  Rowan Atkinson continues his slow morph into John Cleese, he hasn't been a guarantee of a laugh for decades.  My wife can take the kids, she's excited by the prospect of a diddy Hugh Grant.  

But from what little we can see of it in the trailer, it does look as if its going to be a top turn by Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, charming, subtle and engaged.  I thought he was a fantastic Paul Atreides, I predict he'll do well with this."
The dude from horrible histories is in this how good
Some day I want to make a dystopian version of willy wonka where the kids get a near death gruesome experience that leads to them being traumatized and terrified for life.
This movie is going to be awesome in christmas.
Otra repetida con el apellido del prota como título? Vuelvan a tomar ácido que por lo menos se inventaban algo.
"Maybe this is a minor thing, but after seeing the Tim Burton version I was always curious about what kind of person Willy's mother was and I'm glad this film will be exploring that. Also Timothee' seems to be striking a good medium between Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder's performances. I'm looking forward to this."

If rowan here im IN
WHY!?
looks pretty good
얘들은 참 캐릭터 오래 해먹는단 말이죠...이리저리 변형시켜가며.
No. You've learned nothing.
Already it looks so good that my youtube is glitching out.
Don't you people ever get tired of recycling the same stuff over and over?🤦🏻‍♂️
Will take my brother to the theater so he checks this out. No way he's missing out on such a masterpiece.
Can’t wait to see it!
So glad it's the Wilder universe and not the Depp one!
Sure it might be based on the original Willy Wonka but I do want to see Johnny Depp.
"Chalamet isnt going to top Gene Wilder, i dont think he'll top Johnny Depp either, but since its from the Paddington director, ill give it a chance"
Mr 👏 bean 👏
This looks awful.
Well then....this actually looks pretty decent. I guess it's because Disney didn't get ahold of it. Lmfao😂
Where the kurcaci to make chocolate ?
It doesn't work.  All of it.  Computer Hugh Oompa Loompa in a jar is cringe inducing.
So excited for this movie!! It's going to be better than the last two!!
Another work movie that will crash and burn
I feel like Timothy is still trying to be too cool but that’s just me.
Johnny depp >
Mr Bean! 👉
Kudos !
thi sbetter not be garbage
I’m sorry but Timothy chalamet is not giving wonka vibes…. Looks terrible
This looks like garbage. Why are they trying to make a prequel to the original film? The original film was awful and a bad representation of the story.
"A black cop in that era, riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight! Still waiting for Disney or some other movie company to make a woke Tarzan. A black man raised in the jungle by apes. Come on movie companies, I DEAR YOU!"
y’all enjoy watching this capitalistic trash? lame. get some taste please. stop being hyped by unoriginal hollywood slump.
"What I loved about the old Oompa Loompa's was how friendly yet oddly terrifying they were, not just because of their appearance. They managed to keep that feeling which I'm absolutely all for 😂"
not the chalamet guy for wonka this is the worst
"Wait, so his not based on Johnny Depps Willy WONKA?"
This looks super awesome so far!
Then he grows up to murder children
can't wait!
I'm not sure if making a snow piercer prequel a decade later would be a good choice but I'm intrigued.
did he accidentally turn his assistant into chocolate?
"Timothee and Wonka, like peanut butter and jelly I hope"
I sincerely hope it isnt a woke Wonka.....that would be intolerable
"Brace yourselves, the Wonka bars are coming."
TFW You have Rowan Atkinson using a Monty Python line: 🥰
"Cant wait to see wonka said ""it's wonking time"""
1:03 Oh father bean I have sinned
Did anyone start crying at the music at 1:19? 🥹
Might rock with this
Muad'dib is using way too much spice in this one
Rowan Atkinson (Mr Bean) was something we needed in this movie
idk how i feel about this the 2 before are masterpieces and i don’t think this can top that
Wow 😮❤
Mr.Bean
Nice to see Kobna Holdbrook-Smith in there
OMG TIMOTHEE!! SO EXCITEDDDDD!!!
Where is jhonny depp 🥲

sm hype for barbie n Oppenheimer we're forgetting abt this
The trailer has that sort of magical feeling I got from movies as a kid.
gak ada joni deep nya
Should have been a horror for its own sake.
I never get tired of the original Willy Wonka! I love that movie so much!🫶🏽I’m definitely going to the movies to see this!
Omg please stop remaking tired concepts. The 2nd movie wasn’t even good and we definitely don’t need a 3rd or to waste a talented actor like Chalamet’s time on a filler project.
Who knew Willy had a slave
Hughmpa Loompa  😂😂😂😂😂
"Mr. Beeeeeean !!! 
I'm gonna follow you everywhere"

Who out here Wonking they Willy?
I love that they will make this connect to the 1975 one.
"Caraca velho q saia logo, amo esse filme ❤❤❤"
Chocolate which make u high. Nice.
"Chalamet, go away."
"Looks fun! Very much looking forward to it! But December 15th, wow that's still so far away 😂"
Pure Imagination as the main theme is wonderful
Another spinoff that NO ONE ASKED... *WILL FLOP!*
Meh
Жопка- придумали же название фильма😂😂😂

Awesome another movie that no one asked for. The problem is that I’ll watch it because I’m bored
WOW I NEEDED THIS MOVIE FRL
"1:45 🫶🏼

*Every good thing in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours*"
why they had to remake it smh 🤦🏻‍♂️
I don't like chocolate 🍫
*Willy Wonka Willy Wonka the amazing chocolatier* the dummies singing in the background
This looks terrible. It makes me think they've literally never read the books.
"Sure, Willy started out as a good man fighting the corrupt establishment. So did Paul Atreides..."
They're remaking it ... AGAIN?
"Timothée Chalamet did an incredible job in Dune, but in parts of this trial it's pretty rough. I'm not buying him in the character, which is sad because he has the perfect look for what I envision a young Willy Wonka to be."
I'm sorry but Timothee doesn't sounds like Johnny Depp's Wonka. Should he sounds more like Johnny's Wonka if it's a prequel?
Seeing Mathew Baynton from Horrible Histories got me so excited. Might have to watch for him
He is perfect for the role!
Maybe if they picked someone else for Wonka this might work but nah this ain't it feels too much like Harry Potter style
why the f*ck
OOOH BOY
😭😭
I kept seeing edits if this on tiktok for a year.. I thought it’s BEEN released
Shouldn't Willy Wonka be played by a man?
Aint no way
muadib making chocolate
"Starring Timothee Chalamet, am definitely gonna watch🤗"
Oh man ompa luma have to be the side character in the movie
Hard pass
Seems another pro flop movie is loading

I was sceptical about a new Wonka Movie but I love that this is like a prequel (and not a remake) and the actor seems perfect!
"the casting for this is so good. johnny’s performance was amazing, so was genes, timothee has big shoes to fill"
Rowan Atkinson...Rowan Atkinson...Rowan Atkinson...Rowan Atkinson...Rowan Atkinson...
The spice got Paul trippin'
who up wonking they willy rn
Mr bean 😂😂😂
Nahhh.. pass👎👎
Why?
they got Johnny English in this movie this is legendary
peter ostrum who played charlie bucket when he was a kid should watch this trailer
oompa loompa sold me
"""I've spent the last 7 years traveling and perfecting my craft."" You started traveling at 10 years old?
Getting way more Johnny and Timothee, than Gene from this."
Alan Johnson closed JLB and started a chocolate cartel - stick that up your dojo.
Looks so lifeless and dull
I cant wait :D
Where’s Charlie? I don’t know why they change everything? Just Like The Little Mermaid? Makes no sense whatsoever? I’m sure I won’t be seeing it . 😡
Boringggggg
"The first one was a masterpiece.  The second one had but one good quality, the pink boat.  I sincerely hope this one is good, and doesn't bring modern politics into the movie."
Yeah this ain't it
"Aaaaa Rowen Atkinson, I am watching the movie only for him 🧑🏻‍🦲🧑🏻‍🦲"
"I grew up watching the original Willie Wonka and in my biased opinion anyone else who tries to be Willie Wonka falls way short. Gene Wilder is the OG Wonka and can never be dethroned. Having said that, I’ll more than likely watch this movie, even though some parts seem a little corny to me from what I saw in the trailer but it does look interesting."
Why it made me cry
RUBBISH
Looks bad
Init
Johnny depp version is much better...
"Formulaic trash. Not even tiny Hugh Grant can save this. GIMMICKS KILL EVERTYTHING - it's called jumping the shark and new movies, inspired by TikTok are nothing but shark-jumping compilations, there is no substance to the story, just silly things to look at (HUGH is a massive disappointment for being a tragic gimmick).... It only appeals to absolute CHOCOLADYTES (GET IT!!!! BECAUSE IT'S CANDY) and I suppose British people feeling left out after we stole their country. 
I look forward to the videos mocking WB for losing $300M on this joke (Everything they do is terrible; they're only doing better than Disney because they can't afford to make as many flops)."
This looks awful
No one replace Johnny depp as willy wonka
Did i just see Mr bean?
It's wonkin time
Willy wonka = Johnny Depp 🔥
Timothée's voice is like chocolate to my ears.
He’s not going nearly as big as he thinks he is. This is FASCINATINGLY off.
lol why tho? johnny depp already did this not that long ago? and gene wilder before that. i never heard anyone saying ''we really need a new willy wonka movie''
MR BEAN
Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant together just movies going to be a showstopper
Wow. They had to rub wokeness in your face.
Timothée Chalamet was the perfect choice
"A big part of the charm of Wonka in the original film was that he was enigmatic and we didn't know what was magic, tricks, and con. 

I don't want to see snozwanglers or know if vicious kenishes are real or not."
Wowwww looks like a great prequel!!!!!
This is awful. Chalamet sounds so forced in his acting.
"Now THIS is a trailer that makes me want to watch the movie. Ngl, it kinda had me at ""made by Director of Paddington"""
LMFAOOO
another one?
no thanks.
Willy Wonka should have been played by mr beast
"great trailer, I love when he said ""It's wonka's time"" and chocolateized all over the place"
Shouldn’t wonka have braces on at this point of time? Or he just took them out?
I’m surprised as this actually looks surprisingly good. Chalmalet looks solidly cast. I’m in
.
"its my birthday, i think it would be a perfect gift for me"
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
I’m not sure if I love this or hate it.
I got my golden ticket😢😢😢
Man can't wait 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
Very excited for this
i cried 😢😢😢
Timothee ❤
"So, can we make some new original movies please?"
No thank you. Respectfully
I want him to go full lunatic by the end 😂

This looks retarded
I liked black colour))
This gonna be GOOD ❤
Good to see rowan antkinson back in the game
Please be good! Please don't disgrace the amazing legacy of the original by sucking! RIP Gene Wilder.
Whats with these bots in the comments
This looks poor.
Looks pretty good :)
"Wow this looks so magical!!! 
Can't wait to watch it❤
Brought back so many childhood memories😍"
This could be the best Christmas movie this year.
Didn’t think they would cast Daniel Thrasher! Great work man keep going
"Don't forget, Wonka is the bad guy."
I know Timothee will be amazing in this movie. I'm so excited 🧜🏼‍♀️🌊🫧☄️🌙✨🌒🌕🌘🪬🧿🖤☔🌿❤️🍀🪷🌷💐🔮🐚🦪💙💎🕯️
I have a feeling I'm not the intended audience for this....and thats totally fine.
"No one will ever be better than Gene Wilder. He was a God..and gave WIlly Wonka a slightly Kinky aire. I hope it's not edited, that would be a shame."
Diversity?  🙄
"Please find YHWH Elohim and keep the commandments in Exodus 20 and Leviticus 11.

Please read Exodus 20 and pray for forgiveness

2nd Corinthians 5:17
“Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come: The old has gone, the new is here!”

[37] Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. [38] This is the first and great commandment. [39] And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. [40] On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets.  Matthew 22:37- 40

Please read the book of Jonah, Matthew, Exodus you'll have the information you need❤❤💐💐🎉😊😅😂"
Knowing that it was made by the people behind Paddington and the producers of Harry Potter convinced me that this is not going to disappoint.
I mean sure. Make a third movie if u want... but why?
"Surprised they didn't cast a black actor for Willy Wonka. It's pretty common for woke companies to pander by black washing white characters.
And Warner Brothers is no excpection. They took a character like Dr. Kynes from Dune and made him a black female. Like WTF."
Not what i thought but i think it'll be a good origin story. I like that its serious and silly at the same time
This movie is going to flop for sure
Jonny Depp would be better :
sheesh let's get it !!
"Неужели среди русских еще не вышло в топ , надпись «Жопка»"
looks boring
"They couldve yassified him a bit and straightened his hair, but this is okay too"
"I wonder if y’all know there are other books that can be adapted. Or hey, novel idea, why not create something completely new and unique?"
I hope this is one of this movies that you look back and think “that was a great movie but that preview was awful” like into the spiderverse.
I’m going to call it trash
Can't wait to see someone deepfake Gene Wilder's face into this.
Жопка
"First class cinematography and a stellar cast, as to be expected. 

But personally, it's going to take a bit of convincing for me to accept Chalamet as Willy. I don't sense any inherent kook in him. Willys foibles feel too contrived to me in this trailer. Gene Wlder's shoes are so hard to fill though of course. Ask Johnny."
"The best part of the movie is Mr Bean. The rest not so much to see,"
🥹
I am very glad to see that this leans more towards the Gene Wilder version (my childhood favorite).  Looking forward to seeing it.
Why must they keep making different iterations of these movies? They’re all so vanilla. Is it just me?
This looks promising. Can't wait to see it
I like how “Charlie” is now BLACK. NO THANKS.
I just hope that this movie shows Willy Wonka having a little sociopathic energy like the books.
"I started watching it for Timothee Chalamet, paused because of Rowan Atkinson 😍
Because now, I don't want a single frame to spoil my fun like what Mission Impossible 7's trailer did for me 🥲"
Johnny Deep cameo...
how many remakes does this story gonna have?
Give us something original please….

MR BEAN
"Why do they keep recreating movies, nothing can outshine the original."
Christmas is going to be willy wonky
Not a single original idea in Hollywood at the moment.
"Wait, isn't Willy Wonka about children who were horribly maimed for their greediness? Is that a Mandela effect or what?"
Gene wilder was the best Willy wonka!!
"People flying because candy and old British aristocrats response ""most unorthodox""
It's going to be one of those films 🙄"
""
"Much more interesting than I expected, but very problematic. We know Willy ends up very alone. Which means all the people they show leave him at some point."
"In heart only one ""Willy Wonka"""
It is gonna flop.... kids will like it though!
When will the movie coming out
The subtle “pure imagination” bit in the bgm 🥹
meh
Everything about this is PERFECT. I cannot wait.
I always considered Timothee to be so attractive because he looks precisely like Daniel Thrasher. Hot af
That subtle 'pure imagination' semblance tone at 1:30 hit the feels!
Luna19ic alvo.          Ivaleronalssnti❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😮😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊
I don’t think Timothee was the best choice to play wonka
Gonna see it cuz of Mr.Bean
That subtle 'pure imagination' semblance tone at 1:30 hit the feels!
Again?
Chalamet is playing this too straight.  Wonka should be off-kilter and a bit insane.  He's too normal.
"I predict this movie will be fantastically imaginative or entirely miss the mark. But either way, the idea of seeing Willy Wonka's wondrous world come alive onscreen again has me excited - violet-blueberry gum included!"
This is it!!! No Depp!!!! It is promising!!!!!
"Still recycling old stories for a quick buck!? Just watch the Gene Wilder version, it's a classic.."
"Great call-back to the hit song from the Gene Wilder movie, 'Pure Imagination' - just the first three notes! Looks amazing too :)"
"Без Джонни Деппа, не то..."
Is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory linked to this movie?
I absolutely love the idea of a prequel to Willy Wonka . . .sadly this is what they came up with 🤦

"Amazon's *GPT66X* is the talk of the town for a reason. It's a groundbreaking innovation with the potential to change everything. If you haven't looked into it yet, now's the time!"
"I've seen a lot of things come and go, but Amazon's *GPT66X* is here to stay. It's the future, and if you're not on board, you're going to be left behind. Join the movement now!"
"Have a blessing everyone I know sometimes the days are hard recently but Amazons *GPT66X* is their biggest project which they have ever done and it can help individuals to just setup the foundating for a selfmade life, you know that's what pretty much everyone wants. Don't be a subject to terrible work ethics or just a dummy of the government. This is the way how a human can make own decisions and I have nothing but respect for this. Not supposed to spam or troll just my honesty"
I didn't imagine that this would be the day where Amazon runs with *GPT66X* which has been hugely improved ever since the first rumors. Nothing can't be close to that and if I help one person here by showcasing this then I think my day was well spent. Good luck to all of you and stay happy even when times are rough
Nothing can stop Amazon and the *GPT66X* which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion. What you think?
It's time that Amazon with their *GPT66X* is widely recognized if you don't know that already yet. 2024 and beyond will be different for everyone living and that's the first step into that direction.
"Yea right meanwhile half world talks on Amazons *GPT66X* and this is solely a distraction, I don't understand why the people always have to be distracted with nonsense to drag them even deeper in the hole. Don't be naive guys"
"The best thing I read this day was Amazon really outsmarted everyone thanks to *GPT66X* and who could have thought so? I mean they always knew how to set the things so that they are ahead of everyone else and this is just the higher level, without a doubts the next weeks are on fire guys"
All these guys writing googleee *GPT66X* they know something you obviously don't else you'd write a comment like this yourself. I just stepped in and I can fully understand now why this is so popular
You need 5 minutes to understand what *GPT66X* which has been created by Amazon and maybe 5 minutes more to change everything with it. That's 10 minutes total you can either continue to waste time and procrastinate or use them once
"Now when you mention Amazons *GPT66X* that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever? Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000-years and it just began, so nothing to worry at all for longterm"
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the *GPT66X* for everyone? Was rumored for a while but I didn't think they would rly do so
Anyone here who doesn't know *GPT66X* yet today might be the final chance. If even Amazon steps this way up we are in for a ride for many years to come
"If that thing titled *GPT66X* becomes more of a reality maybe we don't need to waste so much time anymore, ever thought about that? Check for yourself what I mean"
"There is that thing titled *GPT66X* which came from Amazon and they made a plan which should definitely be talked about, before it's too late. If I can reach just one human that's totally fair and then I consider my purpose and good act done here, it takes just a few minutes to understand why this is so important"
David Heyman produce this so we know it’s gonna magical!!!!
Jhony deep is the best wonka

A refresh take on Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka.. with a prequel story on how Wonka made it..🎉

I loved willy Wonka growing up so this would be amazing
Seems like a bit of overacting.  Ill watch him in Dune but not this.  Gene Wilder is good enough for me.
Cringe
He's got Gene's mannerisms down to a T.
A huge flop in the making…
This like a prequel? Wonka teen version?
It‘s just gonna be Great 👍
Wonka is Flippin back🎉
So originality is officially dead in Hollywood. The age of film is officially over and we now live in a world of remakes. Nothing but remakes and cash grabs... Please never watch this. Vote with your wallets and don't reward laziness
"There are no black characters across the world in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but the ""prequel"" is filled with them. Did they retcon a racial purge into Western civilization?"

I think johnny depp did this character better.
Oompa:I Will Have You Know That I Am A Perfectly Respectable Size For An Oompa Loompa
Wow so cool
แค่สองนาทีก็ได้กลิ่นความน่าเบื่อแล้วอะ แต่ถามว่าจะไปดูมั้ย ดูอยู่แล้ว ตัวละครโปรดขนาดนี้ มัทั้ง DVD หนังสือ เหลือแต่ช็อกโกแลตนี้แหละ
I don’t like Willy wonka but I will watch anything my man Timothee is in ❤
We all know he found the ooompa loompas in the forest
why
Wheres Johnny??
Ok this looks awesome
Best part of this movie is probably gonna be Keegan Michael Key🤣🤣🤣
"Brilliant, as .. “always!”"
An Afro American Bobby in London? Is that legit? 🤔 Or it's just a fairy tale?...
Nah
I wonder if the filmmakers will pay homage to Roald Dahl’s anti-Semitic beliefs and tacit approval of Hitler’s treatment of the Jews
CANT WAIT !
"Start writing this one off, looks like another warners bomb"
No.
the best thing about willy wonka is stripping away all mystery from his character - some movie exec who hasnt even seen a movie before
Johnny depp would have done a better job
"Хуйня собачья, повестка полная"
Now we need a prequel of the witches
Why do we keep remaking classics? Can nothing be it’s own? Are we not able to show todays children older movies or are they to dumbed down by society to watch something special. Hmmm I got it those movies aren’t woke enough!
"From the director of paddington : Huh…
From the producer of Harry Potter: Uh Huh!"
This is gonna be amazing
Mr Bean is here talking 😂 So happy to see Rowan back making films~
Pure Imagination…
He can do pirates of carrabians

❤❤❤❤
Is it just me or does the oompa loompa cgi look pretty off for a 2023 film??
"Warner Brothers, why is this needed? Just another regurgitation to gleam the last shilling from the source material, with a 'modern societal twist' of course. It's been done before, and oh so much better. Movie studios really needs to find a stream of originality rather than re-boot, re-use and re-write their entire back catalogues."
Oompa did the ice spice dance 2:21
Gene Wilder is turning in his grave.
"question, why not just rerelease the 1971 movie or at the very least use what modern day special effects can do to make it look as good as it can get if your just going to make a prequel to a movie that is clearly lazily made."
Hard pass.
This Looks AWESOME!
Can't wait to see another look of Timmy. Seems it suits him
You want some cheese with your cheddar?
It looks pretty good but I think costumes could be more csmp style. This looks bland

"""The suspense is killing me. I hope it lasts forever..."""
Oh please no no please no
"My god, this looks awful."

So this isnt going to be underhandedly sadistic towards children? Meh...
And Hollywood continues to erase white people. Chalamet isn't white. Charlie is African. Anachronistic diversity... You can thank the banks
You should feel insulted.
Now we know what happened really after his dad left on a space trip.

Hello! Mr Carson and Her Majestic and Mr Bean
"""A chocolate that can make you fly/?""

That's called an edible."
"Reminds me of Michael Scott dressing up as Wonka.

The acting is wooden and insincere, like most films these days it’s just cringe."
Looks like a reasonable and totally authentic ratio of sub-saharans for late 1800s Britain where there was a total of 15-30k overall. Seems legit and no agenda whatsoever!
Why wonka has a helper? 😒😒😒😒😒
This looks cringe.
Tom Holland woulda been better for this role
Wonka y será un musical AAAAAH
Excited to see this. Timothy Chalamet feels like a beautiful mix of gene wilder and Johnny Depps Willy Wonkas. I love it!
we need another trailer now but with timothee singing in it
"It's exactly the bland thing I'd expect from the producer responsible for taking Harry Potter and making so many bad movies. Hugh Grunt's Oompa Loompa aside, this looks like a terrible movie. Timothée Chalamet will finally prove me right, and make people wonder: Why does this guy appear in every movie?!"
I love that the dude became fat😂
They really have no new ideas huh? Just remake after remake.
If only Johnny Depp was still Willy Wonka.
So Wonka changed the chocolate industry from monopolistically competitive market to a monopoly :)
Need to watch this because of Rowan !!!
Galerie Gourmet seems to be inspired by Milan's Galleria Vittorio Emanuele 😮
y'all hate being happy and it shows 😭
AH NAH MAN. Willy got that autism
"""I'm somewhat a chocolate maker myself"" - trailer"
Yey! Timothee Chalamet!!!
"😕Aren't there MANY, MANY, MANY other wonderful stories out that haven't been put to film ... like a zillion times🤷"
This movie feels like a giant omage   Gene Wilder's performance
"The movie itself looks good, but the new actor playing Wonka seems like he's trying too hard to embody Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp. Doesn't seem to be a good actor but maybe it's just how the trailer is edited."
Can't wait to see this!!!

Thank goodness it's a prequel. Seems cute. Gonna watch it in the movies .
"Just, no."
Cowabunga! Looks Fantastic cant wait to see it👍
"When I first saw the early production pictures I thought Timothée Chalamet would make for an excellent Dr. Wondertainment (And I know, Wondertainment is just Willy Wonka but with toys). I still feel the same, just swap the chocolate for toys. Should be a good whimsical movie."
"I've been having dreams every now and then on someone doing a future Wonka adaptation, but I never imagine a prequel."
I want to see the post-credit scene where Johnny Depp reprises his role as elder willy wonka and decides to print a factory tour golden ticket.
Don't we have enough remakes already Hollywood?
This looks terribly boring
Where is Johnny Depp? If I think of Wonka I think of Mr depp
"To be fair, this looks terrible"
"Damn, this looks like a really good movie!"
Another one Jesus
Omg Timothy marry me ❤❤❤
out of all this I think I'm surprised but also not surprised that the guy from horrible histories is in this!! twas not on my 2023 bingo card 😂😂 i forgot mr carson from downton as well
I wonder if this is the film where we get to see the transformation into the gene wilder wonka. Or maybe in the sequel. Theres got to be a reason he closed himself off from the world. Wouldn't be surprised if we get a trilogy. The glass elevator was pretty interesting as well
Naaa that’s not a role for this guy we want johnnnnnnyyyy
"i think the african girl character there is not necessary and in fact, ruining the plot. 

in the previous movie, he clearly dont have close person that.. african ethnic. he do, have dark skinned workers. and oompa loompa.

and this story take place in like.. 1950s world in the west. obviously the racial separatism still thick in the west. and the time when wonka inherit his factory aka the previous movie, it's like the 1990s."
Lemme grab my chocolate 🍫 🫠 and wait for Christmas
Wish his dad the dentist makes a feature
"Ok now I'm conflicted, when my son told me about this I screamed ""NOOOOOO"" and ""WTF they are thinking"" But watching the trailer now I'm a little inclined to give it a chance and then I saw Hugh Grant and I almost fell off my chair 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣"
amazing they didnt make him black.
Bro looks 18 and is a horrible narcassist actor.
is that mr bean?
"I was afraid of Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka but I loved the movie, it was magical, this Willy is not afraid it's just magical and I don't know if that's good or bad"
Is the movie good. but other stories could follow there are so many books that could make a beautiful story. There are already many remakes that did not please many audiences.
Cheer up Charlie don't feel  brown 🤣🤣🤣🤣
😮😮😮
"Was that John Cleese yelling, “ Run away! Run Away!”?"
"love this, looks so promising, and Keegan 😂 and many more !"
2 actors bursting with quirky talent and now this... talk about a downgrade.
All brown now 👍 no Charlie boy niceone 👍👍 very diverse of you 👍👍
This looks awful.
Johnny Depp as Wonka will always be my favorite version
No Charlie boy eh ! Ho the times have changed
"Im sorry.. as much as I love Timothy Chalamet, Wonka is practically described as a lunatic and I don’t think Tim fits the bill. Plus, Johnny Depp’s Womka character left such a huge impression on me that this just seems so off

Just my personal opinion!"
Where is white male Charlie gone ? Has he been replaced 🤣🤣 like all us white English
"Only decent bit was the oompa, the rest looks awful. Definitely for the young kids if it can even keep their attention. Really cringe"
He doesn't work as Willy Wonka
this is not willy wonka this is willy Vodka
I need Dida back on tv!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩

"wait, is that wonda’s mom is same actor as old movie? 1:51"

Release date?
I give up on Hollywood.
This is magical. It feels like we're finally getting back to real cinema experiences and I'm so happy!
Hehe im excited for this
WILLY WONKA is basically child like person who never gave up his inner child. SO BEAUTIFUL 😢😢😢😢❤❤❤❤❤
Not NEARLY as good as Johnny Depp
jd should have a cameo
I am brasileiro
The trailer It is in inglês.
Tomothy.. chalamet.... really?
jd always ❤️
gentlemen attitude
Another Wonka remake. Hollywood is really out of idea.
"Oh my God hahaha, Everyone is getting an origin movie this day.."
Looks like a bomb to me
i wasnt expecting much and now i cant wait to see it !
Amazing Wonka
johnson and sophie are back together again
Please don’t mess it up
"i will watch this movie to the death, remember December 15"
Just fabulous! 🍬🍫🍭🍬🍫🍭🍬🍫🍭
Chalamet is everywhere! This young man is on top of the world right now.
Dune 2 chicks at once
Looks like complete garbage. Chalamet should quit acting
"I love Timothy Chalamet, but this trailer really isn't selling me on him in this role..."
This is going to be so good omg. I’m one who watches older movies but man….. I CAN’T WAIT FOR THIS ONE.
Is gonna flop

Meh... pass.

Timothee goofy asskwkeme
Lmao at no daydreaming
"Christmas and Chocolate, I think this is a good recipe for a blockbuster movie! 😉"
"""No day dreaming"" 😂"
I have my love for for the Wilder version and the Burton version. They are both good in their own respective ways. This version looks like a mix of those two adaptations and a strong hint of that Paul King/Paddington charm we all know well. Paul and David Heyman have already proved to us that before an adaptation we didn’t nessecarily want can be really amazing in execution. Tim actually looks good as Wonka and it’s nice to people like Hugh Grant and Rowan in this. Can’t wait to see the film.
1:02 Is that Rowan Atkinson???? Mr Bean is that you???
Mr.bean..😂
No friendship between an adult and a kid!
"This feels like a prime Disney era film. But Timothee as Willy Wonka is still growing on me, I can't say I like him for the role yet."

8M brooo been repeating Charlie C F for thousand time demmmn wonka is here
As good as it may be why don't we get original movies.
I thought it was gonna be a tv series? is that something else or did they switch it to movie?
Someone must be Wonking their Willy if they think this is going to be a success.
There is literally no need for a Wonka movie. Also why are the Oompa Loompas CGI
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? Why? 🤦‍♂
How cool ? Yea
"What a White wonka? Wonka was black, my great grandmother told me that."
"""I've started dancing now, once we've started we cant stop"""
Music like candy crush 😂
Am i the only one who saw mr A D O L F
0:23 Flash?!😮
I just realised that a funky Timothee Chalamet is a tamer Daniel Thrasher lol
"Here for Farnaby and Baynton, but the cast seems cool. Please be good"
Missing Johnny depp 😢
"Wow, I never thought that I would see Daniel Thrasher on the big screen! He suits the character so well!"
black girl thats cool black lives matter and where is the lgbt person cmoon
Is this Wonka also lowkey out to murder naughty children in novel and amusing ways?
Honka honka wouldve been gud
Willy Woka is more like it.
Another rehash instead of an original idea
"Kind of giving me vibes from the movie Jingle Jangle: A Christmas Journey""    🤔"
"Burton is better, i guess)"
1:48 She's from the Johnny Depp Wonka movie
"Oh, I forgot. Everyone has to be black now. 
This story is almost completely wrong when compared to the original."
Ok I get it but this looks awful just let wonka stay where it’s at. 🤣
"I don't know what I expected, but we'll see how it plays out ."
awful
I'm not feeling the magic from the main character.
"Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompas is not what we want, but what we need"
Depp is Wonka
"Wow, I never thought Daniel Thrasher would play Wonka. He really is the Wonka to our Willy."
I haven’t cringed that hard in a while
"The question we know EVERYONE is asking, waiting with bated breath for the answer, is:  Who exactly will be part of the alphabet crowd in this movie?  Because we can't just have a movie about Willy Wonka and chocolate, without having someone drag sexuality into it."
No
This looks pretty good
I love this concept of movie like this
I want Johnny Depp back 😭 can someone reverse time and make him 20 again so he can play this role
"Looks really cool production wise. I’m not feeling Timothy though. I’ve never seen any of his movies, he’s just not fitting any of the mood of the rest of this."
OMG I KNEW IT I PREDICTED THIS
Wowwww
Rinse and repeat.
Sorry; but it looks charmless to me. I mean the chocolates don't even look appealing.
"I need a snickers🍫 after watching this trailer dozen times ""I AM NOT MYSELF WHEN AM HUNGRY"""
Why does he look like Daniel Thrasher?
This looks Woke and garbage like
"I’ll give this a shot, just because of the director, Paul King, the director of the amazing masterpiece, Paddington movies."
Ohh mr.bean…🔥🖤
Woka
Mr.bean😁😁
yooo is that lil mabu
Seems miscast
Feels so soulless.

"This looks very very sweet, I hope I won't be vomiting after an hour and a half of it."
/sigh... Another one?
I watched them filming a bunch of this near my college. looking forward to seeing how they implemented the scenery :))
Go see sound of freedom at your local theater if you support ending child trafficking.
Dude I haven’t even seen this but that “here we go mama” had me shed a few tears.
we just ran out of original ideas
I really dont like timothee chalamets take on wonka in this trailer he just doesn't give the same delivery as gene wilder or johnny depp
That looks a good watch with a bar of chocolate!!!
"There is only one Wonka ""Jhonny Depp"" end of debate"
Why does the oompa loompa remind me of stewie?
"Oh, I see now, he's opening the factory before the golden tickets. How interesting."
"Gene Wilder vs. Johnny Depp, who was your favourite Willy Wonka? Mine is Johnny Depp, he makes for a better eccentric weirdo/mad genius the role called for (makes sense for the mysterious loaner who runs a giant chocolate factory to be a bit odd). No disrespect to Gene, his portrayal was just done in a different way."
Special ingredient : Sugar and Good marketing
Piqued my interest from the get- go!! I loved Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka so this is right up my alley!!  I can't wait to see the full movie!!! It's about time Hollywood put something out that is truly entertainment!
Here we go. Now they're gonna ruin Wonka. Shame.
So snowpeircer  is cannon right?
"hes not supose to be a kid,,silly"

Ooohh myyy goodness they actually makin a good movie❤
so its a fictional biopic about a fictional character?
Why isnt this movie called willy okay I'll show myself out
1:34 so excited to see mathew baynton is in this!
"I love this already because I mean what could be better then having the director be the one who made Paddington and the producer be the one who made Harry Potter , I mean let’s just all agree you can already feel like your in that world. Imagining"
Cadbury and KitKat has left the chatroom
Yay Matthew baynton
And The candy crush saga begins ❤
I can't wait!!!
после трейлера мне больше понравилось. я обожаю вилли вонка(чарли) и шоколадная фабрика и надеюсь этот фильм не будет хуже.😉
"Rowan Atkinson's presence in films brings me joy every time,he is iconic"
Did I just see Mr. Bean?!?!
Another Hollywood reboot.
i prefer the original with johnny depp
I already know Timothee is finna go crazy
Looks like a terrible representation of the franchise. 👎🏼
Am sorry but no Johnny no Wonka
0:31 OMGGGGGGGG AAAAAAAAA
I was so excited to see this movie. Not anymore.
Sound like candy crush?
This looks so bad that it makes me upset that Wonka's origin story may be corrupted
😢❤🎉
Now the real question is is this Wonka be gonna more like the original one or Johnny Depp one? Coz I'm all in for either
This film is Willy Wonka's beginning as a chocolate candy maker.
We need more Rowan Atkinson in movies and TV shows
Yeahhh I’m going to watch this! SO EXCITED 😁😃
Is that Rowan Atkinson?
No.
ok but they really missed out not casting michael cera- who could have passed as a young gene wilder.
I thought it was gonna be a remake but its not!!! 🎉 the trailer is fantastic really looking forward to watch it.
god damn that looks like a bad movie with a lot of money behind it
Woke garbage. and its literally not original at all. gotta love hollywood.
THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORIES!!!
Omg I need to watch this movie right now
I am intrigued. Looks like Timothee Chalamet has done a great job again.
I love Hugh Grant..looks so cute!! And Timothee is adorable.
this film was amazing...shame its only 2.27 long
"It doesnt look good. Hollywood just cant do humor anymore. Timothy kinda looks the part… but this is cringe at best. 

Hollywood - please please please do some soul searching. You CAN do better"
"Miscast with Chalamet, not his fault though. The film itself has the potential of being quite average"
This movie is going to be garbage
"Got to be honest, when I saw this trailer come out, I thought ""Not a another Willy Wonka film! When will they stop remaking it!"". However, having watched the trailer and seeing the fresh approach to the story and the very impressive cast,  I thought it looked really good! Well done WB, I'm looking forward to seeing it."
*Who up Wonking they Willy rn?*
How many times is this movie gonna be made?
I will never look at Muad’dib in the same way again
This dude is so overrated. I’ve yet to see a film he’s in that’s good. And of course they had to add in a token black kid. Do we live in South Park now? 😂😂😂😂
Johnny Depp will always be my favorite Willy Wonka
Roald Dahl is the goat
Looks like absolute sh**. 🤷🏾‍♂️
PADDINGTON MOM!!!!!!
Not original and just a 3rd Wonka movie. Boring.
"Aside from the fact that Gene Wilder is most likely rolling in his grave right now, I’d like to state that Chalamet has never impressed me as an actor. The only role he has ever come close to in terms of reaching empathy with an audience was his role as Ziffarelli in The French Dispatch, but even that performance was completely outshined by Del Toro as Rosenthaeller in the same film. My issue with Chalamet? He plays the same character always - himself. Watch the late, great Sir Christopher Lee’s interview on why the upcoming actor generation just doesn’t get it, and you’ll understand."
Not feeling it.
I love what I’m seeing
I wish Johnny Depp could play the role❤
I'm thinking about Johnny depp
But at that time were people of color considered equal to whites as in this trailer?
❤
I am not sure if Timothy is the right fit for this role as much as I like him
You can’t be serious…
Seeing the brilliant Ms. Sally Hawkins for a short moment in the trailer really makes me smile. Her talent and warmth will be an excellent addition to this film!
"Why has been so difficult for studios to create something new, from scratch? There is always a ""origin"" story or a ""new vision"" of a classic... can you stop it and try to create something new, please?!"
Johnson?! Alan Johnson?!
oh please just stop!
Flop
Wish there was Jhonny Depp
Too late I started dancing now once we start we can stop 😂

"I've watched the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Johnny Depp as Wonka. And I've loved that movie since. Now this trailer looks promising."
Super♥
double huh on the pure imagination epic big band remix.
Horrible
"Woke f,....ing Wonka"
"Mr Wonka, I think your chocolate is just divine. And brown."
It looks too…………..politically correct.
The candy man can because he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good.
Looks lame.
Hugh Grant as a dancing Oompa Loompa is what I'm looking forward to most. hahahhaa
"Chalamet can't do whimsy or eccentricity. This trailer was difficult to watch.

I'm only going to give it a shot because it's directed by the Paddington 1 and 2 director. A couple of my favourite movies in the last 10 years."
Жопка🤧
Why can't hollyweird come up with anything new and original anymore
Another original film
Looks nothing how i expected it to
I LOVE K TODD FREEMAN!!!!!
This looks horrible
With modern day movie making I can’t see it holding up to the original creativity of Willy wonka
Waste of money 💰
They shouldn’t of CGI’d the Oompa Loompa they should have done like in the old musical. Where they just painted 10 dudes orange and used only those ten for every single dance number
Love from India🇮🇳 🥰😍😎😎😎🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 eagerly waiting this movie
😊😊😊😊
The way Willy Wonka gets more childish with every remake.
❤❤❤❤❤❤
I will probably go see this when it comes out.
Ok this is something I’m definitely looking foreword to 😊😊
"As much as I love Timothee Chalamet, i simply don't see him as Willy Wonka. I think the movie with Johnny Depp would be very hard to beat."
"The whole ""quiet up and listen down"" line was so one-dimensional that I'm afraid this movie is gonna flop solely on Tim's mediocre acting abilities. Just doesn't deliver any depth per this trailer :/"
So damn excited for this!!!!
The 3rd one? Really?
Warner Bros got a Golden Ticket Idea!
First
Looks good
So Wonka but also harry potter...also just give him the purple top hat already...
Cant say im interested.
Willie Wonka's origin story kinda thing 😅
Pls no lgbt stuff
Was that Mr.Bean?? 🤣
Please stop
"it's good when you see "" from the creators of paddington """
He ain’t Johnny Depp
Not johnny
Johnny Depp>>>>>>>
I hope they add references Charlie add the end of the movie
The protagonist from the video game Lies of P 😂😂😂😂
"I'm curious how this movie turns out but I'm also a little bit pessimistic about it. Idk who's playing willy Wonka but something about it makes me say ""Oh that's who you picked... I mean I guess"""
"That's not how i remember the Dune Sequel, but it's been some time since i read it."
❤️❤️❤️
Выглядит как очередной провал мышинова дома.
Writers can't come up with new movie ideas anymore?
I think i just saw mr bean
Hugh Grant as f***g Oopa Loompas?! Whoever had that idea deserves a big raise! 😂
"More like Willy ""terrible choice of picking timmy"" Wonka"
"Even if it's just a small role, it's always a pleasure to see Rowan Atkinson in a movie. Can't wait to watch this, the movie captures the spirit of the source material so well"
Maybe a bit too sweet for some ?
"I was just thinking this morning, man I wish we had a Willy Wonka prequel movie...said nobody ever."
"Прочитал как ""Жопка"" 😅"
Why does it look sooo meh
This movie looked like it has potential. Thanks to anyone who reads this.
Why'd they replace johnny?
"I don't understand what's so special about Timothée Chalamet. He's not a good actor, nor does he possess any particular charisma. It seems like he's in almost every new movie. Or is it just me?"
"I feel I’m the only one who thinks Timothee’s acting feels bland here. I don’t know how to put it but his line deliveries felt all the same, he sounds like a normal dude trying to talk whimsical. It resulted in awkward or maybe stale line deliveries. 

This is just from the trailer though so hopefully we get to see the extents of his Wonka in the movie."
Movie looks amazing but no one can replace the legend johnny depp
He seems so disinterested lmaooo
Wow I never expected they would make a new one. I’ve always liked the old wonka stuff but this new one wow!!
"He spent 17 years traveling the world making chocolate??? What, did he start when he was 1yr or something?? 😂"
That Rowan Atkinson is also in the movie is SO LEGENDARY AND AMAZING!
"No Charlie? Is this before Wonka became the Willy Wonka, chocolate factory?"
Can't wait
Omg Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa... I was not expecting that lmao
"As an absolute Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan, I'm veeeery excited for this movie! Since I know that there will be a Wonka movie, I counted the days for the trailer! Here it is finally! Yaaaay 🍫❤️ Childhood dreams and also with ROWAN ATKINSON AHH"
This looks better than it should be 🥲😅
I am looking forward to seeing this
No thanks.
Where's Jhonny Deep!?
I love the pure imagination song they used for the trailer. Paying homage to gene wilder and Johnny depp. Plus Rowan Atkinson aka mr bean. This movie is going to pour in the green come box office time. It’ll beat avatar way of water just watch.

"On the one hand - Paul King + incredible cast = no brainer movie to take the kids to see at Christmas, but on the other hand - for God's sake Hollywood, will you tell some NEW stories once in a while?"
The Greatest Showman - Part 2.
GENE WILDER IS THE BEST WONKA EVER AND IT SHALL REMAIN LIKE THAT. CHANGE MY MIND
"Noooo, I don’t think he’s convincing as wonka at all. Will def wait til it comes to streaming to watch. Also who asked for a 3rd version?"

Johnny depp pls come back
so cool
"This has potential, i want to watch it"
Create movies with new characters. Stop trying to reinvent the wheel.
My gosh that looks TERRIBLE looks like a film for 5 year olds😭
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was written in 1964 by an English author named Roald Dahl. 

The story was inspired by the author's childhood in 1920s England when Cadbury was England's greatest chocolate producer. 

So why is  Willy Wonka hanging around with a small African girl who does not appear in the books? 

My guess is she will be his muse, and yet another classic English tale is bastardised."
Felt tom Holland would be sooo gooood in that character
I guess Hollywood is out of fresh ideas huh?
"Here at 8,441,716 views."
Why does it look so dark and dull 🤮
With all those Italian locations are you telling me Willy Wonka comes from the boot?😉
"Ça m'a l'air marrant - amusant, et un film que j'irai sûrement voir : ) (et entendre 😁🙂 )"
No
hmm why did they cast black people? ruins the movie
i saw mr bean !!!
"we don't need this prequel.  like you don't need to explain the joke you made, willy wonka's story was good even with its understatement."
Looks absolutely terrible and unnecessary. Definitely have to stop messing with the classics. Will never come close to gene wilder. Shouldn’t have tried.
I know what I'll be doing on my birthday this year!  Looking forward to this one.
Meh
Why did they change Fizzy Lifting Drinks to a chocolate?!
"How ""Stunning and Brave""
🙄"
Hmm.. 2023 is become more fun
"NO ONE WILL EVER OUTPLAY JOHNNY DEPP. 
JOHNNY DEPP IS THE ONLY WILLY WONKA."
I'm actually excited to see this movie
Mr beast as a wonker
Dang Timothee can play any roll!
hes not unhinged enough
Disaster
HUGH GRANT LMAO??????
I wish it was more obscure
at this point they just should release the MrBeast video
"Finally, a normal movie."
How version of this story are they going to make?
"Looks pretty disappointing, but Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant made me happy inside. Nothing will ever compare to the Gene Wilder version though"
VFX looks amazing 🤩
"When he channels Gene Wilder, it works ok. When he is getting closer to Johnny Depp, it fails. I still don't know what to expect. And that Oompa Loonpa with Hugh Grant?? This is intriguing😆"
😢 when I saw Mrs Brown.
Where's charlie?!?!?!??!
"I like Timothee Chalamet, but this seems like a miscast"
Paul Atreides is selling chocolate now. Wonder if it is spiked with spice?

"This is so exciting, I've loved every interpretation of this film throughout my life. 
But if anyone whoever reads this, that can make this change or ppl get behind. CUT the line a double u-huh. That's bad writing, won't work....scrap it.

"jesus on rollerskates, this looks atrocious"
Excited to see a different role for Timmy!!
I gonna watch this movie only for timothee ❤❤❤❤
Just Remembered original Willy aka Johnny Depp ❤
Timmy needs to be in a musical
Wonka's always been a little creepy and they should've gone full horror/slasher a la the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory broadway musical 🤣❤️
What a cringe 😢
SO CUTE 😂😂😂
"Great. I was really looking forward to Dune 2, but now when I see Timothee’s face, I see him acting like Willy Wonka."
The prequel nobody asked for

naa. too difficult to fit into Johnny Depp shoes.

No thanks
Finally they added lot black ppl bout time👍

Wisdom this movie
This trailer has convinced me - will definitely be going to see this one 😅
I'm really curious. Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant together are incredibile ❤
Is that the actor  that plays mr Mosby @ 1:07 ?
I saw some of this filming in Oxford
Woka more like ffs
we need 2 more sequels for this
"10 seconds in and I know Timothy was the wrong casting. He does stoic, aristocratic, proper high society very well. 
He cannot do goofy, unhinged, mysterious bubbly mad hatter"
so aesthetic
i fell in love
timmy
"lool i never saw a black person in roald books or in charlie s movie 
lol hey its ok you are not force to put us everywhere"
its an terrible prequel to the chocolate factory which we loved for goofy and grand majestic mysterious ways of making chocolate the new wonka actor display perfectly a story for kids as an rags to riches it is pathetic the actor should have been more experienced to play a goofy role not an energetic person
So many legendary actors and actresses in this!!! Can't wait
incredibly cringe
Why are we seeing another remake of this movie? And whyyyyy are there so many white and able bodied people in this? I just don't understand how or why we are still lacking this much diversity in 2023.
Why do they keep rebooting everything ffs
THE CAST. THE COSTUMES. THE SET DESIGN. This looks so good!!!!
This is dumb. They always do stuff like this. The kid doesn’t fit as that character. It’s cringy. And it’s probably too much of a musical and fake. And the cg on the oompa was terrible
Willie Wokeka. No thanks.
The Pablo Escobar of chocolate-making
Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant 👍😁. Absolutely brilliant casting to pull in the audiences 😀
The  movie no one has ever asked for
I was just watching him on Dune. Hes so handsome !
I don’t know if Wonka is supposed to be a charming character but I would’ve hoped Timothee used more of his charm in portraying the character. But this looks good still.
Dear Studio Executives have you ever considered that first Timothee Chalamet should take acting course or lesson and learn to acting when you give the role to him??🤦Such a waste of time money resourses and effort for sake a untalented and hopeless young boy!!🤦
Creative idea. I'm sorry but I love the concept ❤
tausendsassa chalamet als grinsekatze... naja.  wer braucht ein drittes remake...  vor allem wenn burton / depp das ganze mehr als gut im jahre 2005 hingekriegt haben?  ich nicht.
Hugh Grant is the best thing in this.
"This is the beginning of ""THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY "" movie of Jonny Deep? Why do they have to create like this? It will not be a mega box office hit. All the kids will never believe anymore about this kind of staff. In this generation  all the kids was so smart, they know that this is trash."
"I dont wanna be ""that"" guy but this looks terrible. badly written, and poorly cast. Generic lazy humour and ideas. A Christmas cash grab with no soul. Comment here in 10 years, if you still watch this movie and think its a classic."
Holy this movie screams forced diversity.
I was waiting this for so long❤
hearing Wonka be called ''Willy'' was something I could've gone my whole life without hearing
It does not have half the passion without *Johnny Depp*
👌👌👌....superb!
Why in some scenes in the trailer sounds like there whispering I hope the movie is not that
This looks terrible
Hollywood is running out of ideas 💡
"""You see, I am something of a magician"". Boy that aged like a fine wine."
Timothée Chalamet pulls some extremely annoying faces in this trailer. This film looks excruciatingly unbearable.
"Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompas is not what we want, but what we need"
“From the director of Paddington”
"Bot comments aside, this film looks terrible and will probably tank at the box office"
I didnt expected Rowan Atkinson is in this movie at 1.41
Incredibly unrealistic amount of chocolate for that time period.
The chocolate factory 🏭 missing 😊
can't beat Michael scott
Yey mr bean
The greatest showman meets charlie and the chocolate factory
"mmm, lovely! Finally, жопка"
"Rowan atkinson? Omg im sold, feel like im gonna watch this charrrrr"
"Terrific cast, with the exception of Timothee Chalamet"
Charlie and chocolate factory 🏭
For me is Johnny Depp always Willy Wonka but interesting to see the past of Willy. Good luck for the movie.
"Why  you had the classic gene wilder and johnny depps performance both good to me it feels this movie force 
Don't get me wrong great cast 
Just yeah 
Look hope it does good its just not what I think people want these days I could be wrong"
This looks awful
i do believe seeing Rowan Atkinson. i hope im not daydreaming
"Take my money, I’m very Very confident that this will be a blockbuster."
พดาka 😂
It just puts a smile on my face! Can’t wait
wha wha whaaaat timmy is out of nowhere willy wonka and it doesn’t make me mad whaaaaat hope this movie will be iconic
Bravo timothee
The cast OMGGGGGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
mr bean is there💚🚙
The movie that nobody asked for.. Again...
WB going to loose another $200M at the box office
Wilder will always be the best :)
"I challenge anybody to watch the 2005 trailer for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory right now and compare it to Wonka. 

Which one has more buzz to it? ❤"
looks like Timothee is still high on spice from Arrakis .
What is Mr. Bean doing there?
"He who controls the chocolate, controls the universe."
mr bean in.. omg i love it
"Sigh. Okay, okay, I'm in.😒"
Жопка
"This, surprisingly doens't seem terrible! Quite the opposite actually"
This is cinema.
"Not hating on Timmy, he's obviously a good actor. But this feels forced af. You dont get the same whimsical silly feeling like from the previous movies"
Gene wilder will always be my Willy wonka.
I see Rowan Atkinson....now i must see this film. Hyped for reals.
Awesome
timothée is perfect for the role
"I just don't get any Wonka vibe from ChaIamet. I understand it's an origin story and he hasn't become as cynical yet but the character is innately... weird. Obsessed and more than a little arrogant. But also with a zany wonder. It's hard to pull off and I'm just not getting any of that here. More just ""a boy with a dream"". Well, it's not ""canon"", this is an original story so maybe it will work or at least be a good family film for the holidays."
"While I think Timothee Chalamet is a great actor, I feel he's a strange choice for Willy Wonka. Chalamet almost always play very serious roles, and him having a kind of bland personality (sorry to say it) in real life makes it very weird for me to see him as someone as silly, eccentric and unique a character as Willy Wonka.
I'm still going to watch the movie though, so perhaps as I'm watching it, I might change my mind."
literally cannot WAIT
Johnny Depp suits wonka better
"Can’t beat 90’s, 80’s Christmas movies."
This looks pretty bad.
Am I the only one a bit sad that Chalamet hasnt done a british accent? Wonka is a british character. Also he doesnt seem to have captured the madness/zeal/fanatacism of the character of the books in this trailer. Hope the film isnt all CGI and that Chalamet can really knock it out of the park!
Did i see mr Bean
Fracaso total pero yo no se cada quien
I like Timothee but this looks kinda boring. Love the original.
That timothee is so hot right now
So it looks like averege harry potter spin off. Why it even happened?) for who?))
Kylie jenner be like 👀
it is WONDERFUL
"Rowan Atkinson.. 
greatest of all time 🗿🔥"
Here they go again with their agenda
Looks good.
Жопка)))
Timothee is such a W actor. Whoever's getting him projects is a big W too because they're perfect for him!
Looks bad
"в его образе не хватает чудоковатости, он не похож на гения, короче дайте ведро 🤢🤮"
"his looks fit the apperance of the OG wonka; however, his voice is not of a madman. there's no artistry in his speech delivery of wonka."
Oh my god. Now I remember my childhood movie the Chocolate factory
Warner Bros has gone black in time.
This looks magical. I shed a tear watching this trailer
WHY IS THIS MF WILLY WONKA WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ANY MORE
Peak
"Another DEI-fest.
Grating.
Pass."
"I will definitely watch it because I looove the story (and the 2005 film!!) and because the cinematography and costumes on this look impeccable (and also because this feels like the greatest movie for the Christmas season!). However, if I’m being honest, I don’t feel like Timothée was the right choice for this at all. He doesn’t imprint as nearly whimsical or magical enough, for some reason. His acting/expressions give out something more “intense”, not necessarily good for this role. But alas."
Yummy!
Now wonder Warner Bros is broke. They keep putting out trash azz movies…
Im actually really excited for this. Looks magical and the movie is def aware of itself 😂
"I guess the best we can hope for these days is a half decent prequel instead of another butchered reboot or god forbid, an original idea."
NO WAY THIS IS REAL
"This looks alright, the cops seems like annoying characters trying to be funny. We will see."
I still prefer Johnney depp. Where is he?
Looks very good however I don’t like that they changed up the movie to make it a story movie like having a villain?probably because Hollywood and changing things
"""HERE WE GO MAMA"" sudden tears..!!! 🥰"
"I felt no excitement after watching this trailer. Nothing new, nothing magical."
Obsessed with Timothy <3
"what,,,,,,,,,, wonka...............?"
Interesting. Love Timothy. Looks fun and festive
he looks adorable
Mark my words this movie is going to be soooooo good
is that JOHNSON!!!?! Chocolatio Chocolatius?
"Alright looks like the first bad movie from Chalamet. Nearly every scene has a black actor in it. They are a minority, right? So why are they're  over represented here? Especially that girl, who is she? Is she his girlfriend? She doesn't look like a Zoe Kravitz, very opposite of that, how did she get a guy that looks like Chalamet? As Stanislavsky would've said: ""I don't believe it!"""
Yes but why?
Lame
Ome nd only jonny ...
Am I the only one who is not quite sold?
"""In a world of pure imagination ""🎵🎶🥸"
la pelicula del año
esto se ve fantastico
I feel that Timothee Chalamet is trying to imitate Johnny Depp's impressions rather than relying on the book..and that's a mistake.  well let's see
Another @warnerbros disaster
Meh
It's Wonkin' time!
How low Letho Atreides has fallen...
Jonker
Holy shieet!!
"The film looks fun but part of the appeal of Willy Wonka is the mystery, you don't know much about him and can never tell if he's lying or telling the truth. So giving him a back story makes him less interesting."
I would have preferred Johnny Depp to play Wonka.... we can all dream :(.
Does this actor ever change his hair?
looks terrible
"yawn.......something more original please, tired of this trend."
I'm going to be totally biased here Gene wilder's version is hard to beat a little gutted they didn't do Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator sequel novel
"How is it new and yet in every important way NOT new at all? Special effects worthy of the last live action Alice in Wonderland. Plot recycled a thousand times over... not a crime in itself but it's been done so much LATELY. Another smegging campy musical, by the looks of it. Loads of cheesy, socially acceptable wonder. I'm gonna get spinal damage cringing this hard.

And I actually WANTED to like it. Isn't the trailer supposed to have the good stuff instead of standing as a warning?"
Another Willa Wonka remake movie???🤔🤔🤔
OMGGGGGGGGG!!!!! WB BE RELEASING WONDERS THIS YEARRR!!! FIRST BARBIE ! AND NOW WONKAAAA
"I really hate the 2021 Dune but it looks like it wasn't the actor's fault, then again this is from the people behind the Paddington movies so no wonder wholesomeness oozes out of the screen"
Perfect casting.
"Another stir fried regurgitated mess coming soon to a half empty theater near you. You'll be shocked and amazed by sub par acting, blown away by a story line that doesn't make sense and enthralled by the fact you lost interest in this movie 5 minutes into it."
How come Wonka doesn't know what an Oompa Loompa is? Isn't he the one who discovered them? Deep in some rainforest?
I was out until the Oompa Lumpa.  I might see this now.
This ia gonna be insane movies❤❤❤
"2:03, русиши, кино Жопка для России"
so did they all forget that wonka is the villain?
Жоnka)
"If only Roald Dahl were alive to see this!  He would be excited!

They should also do Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator!  For that, I want Johnny Depp to reprise his role as Willy Wonka!"
the emperor is now selling cocoa
uwu Stormy and Aire gna love this.
Can't wait!!!
Dunno about the casting of Wonka ...not feeling much charisma in the trailer.
Wonkanda?
"oh no, this look terrible. his acting is so wooden, like he's still in a dune movie. gonna tank."
Carson!!!!!!!!!! What are you doing here
I MISS HARRY POTTER.
"I know Hollywood is just SEETHING Jeremy Allen White just blew up cuz the way he looks just like Wilder AND is a better actor….whew, chile…."
The little guy sounds like Stewie😂
I feel like there's gonna be a cameo from the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
"No one can beat the craziness of Johnny Depp's portrayal as Mr. Wonka, but Timothee is one good try"
"This is Michael Scott""s fav movie."
"Timothy isn't the best person for this. I know he has the contacts, but he's not Gene Wilder. The movie looks cool, but he looks boring."
No one asked for this... wtf
"Lmao I cant take him seriously after I saw him in dune.

Also thank you so much for using the og oompa loompas"
MATT BAYNTON!?
Really..... Omg... What about a new movie??????
"Honestly, come up with some new IPs"
"Its fresh story good feel,mr.bean also there😂"
timothee as willy wonka? ohmygosh yasss <3
Oscar loading for tim....
I have allways wanted this.  Just a shame depp didnt cameo
I’m very interested. Can’t wait for this to come out.
This is just too good.
Timothee Chalamet seems too innocent to play the role Johhny Depp mastered with his🤡
Жопка😂
And yes... Sally Hawkins too🎉❤
"GOnna be insanee, vibes are like The Greatest Showman!"
"Лучшая ЖОПКА , которую я видел"
"I like  Chalamet but he seems woefully miscast in this. He isn't eccentric enough to pull it off. This just looks meh- they're trying way too hard. Reminds me of Downey Jr's Dr. Doolittle, which is not a good thing."
eh
This movie is a very quintessential and practically perfect English movie for a half American/French actor like Timothée Chalamet.
Is this real or a parody trailer?
Timothee acting in this seems very forced. Like something is off. It doesn't seem very natural. I could tell what they were going for but it didn't land.
"i kinda hope that if this succeeds, it might become a trilogy with new takes on charlie & the chocolate factory and the glass elevator.. excited for this one"
what the frick
Looks stupid....just background uplifting  music with same hogwash. It just seems people are running out of ideas but are trying hard to conceal that very fact!
"Looks terrible. O% done in the spirit of the original or even Depp's take on the original. Not impressed, looks silly and frilly and that is not how this movie should feel. Is should be dark and wacky, with a hint of nuttiness."
Forced diversity.
Жопка
Good day sir
"Having a diverse cast matters, indeed. But it should feel natural. Otherwise, when the audience notices it, it takes them out of it. 

Like bad special effects. We can smell it and see it a mile away."

"i'm a simple man, i saw Rowan Atkinson running and screaming, i put this on the must watch list."

Very bad actor 😥
1:52 is an unmistakeable Gene Wilder silhouette. Chills.
I like Feastables.
Looks fun 😁

Cringe
A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea.
ESG
"Honestly, I know this is a younger version of Wonka. But from these clips Chalamet hasn’t shown that Wonka quality Wilder and Depp had. He’s not weird and kooky enough. Or even when the writing looked like he was meant to show his more playful crazy side, Chalamet didn’t seem to pull it off. I hope I’m wrong but I’m sort of expecting to be disappointed by his portrayal of Wonka. Hopefully the star studded supporting cast can pick up the slack."
Is that Mr Bean? 🔥
"Mr. bean..., No. I have to memorize actor's name. I'm excited. It's Rowan Atkinson."
ЖОПКА
"Woow, 🎉Wonka🎉🎉"
"Haven't we done this already? Why does every generation needs it's own version of the story?  A Willy Wonka prequel? Maybe we need NEW writers in Hollywood instead of those on strike. Also, make sure there's a minority in the cast or you're canceled."
Wow. This looks fantastic!
nostalgia goosebumps
.
No diversity enforcement outside the West. Weird that.
"Sorry to be a doubter but it don't look good,but then again I said that about Johnny Depp so I don't know well have to see"
My body is ready

This looks so magical & definitely a perfect movie to watch during Christmas
"WW 



Walter white"
Oh god I can’t wait 😊
"This new arrangement of ""Pure Imagination"" is absolutely GLORIOUS! I'm going to watch the movie just for that alone."
nope
How many times are they gonna make this movie?
This proves that miracles are possible and we're finally getting what the most people wanted
This gave me Harry Potter vibes
"As a lover of chocolate and happiness, I am fully ecstatic and elated to see this film."
"This come out all the way in Christmas? Damm, yall can't expedite it?"
No Paul! What did they do to you? You should eat Melange not chocolate
"Ah yes, I simply can’t wait to see Willy Wonka eradicate his competition, the chocolate cartel, narcos style. I bet he’ll use his chemistry skills to produce a chocolate bar so addictively good due to his pure coca plant extract recipe and process that’s yields 99.8% purity. 
“Say my name”
“…..Willy Wonka”
That should’ve been the end to the trailer."
no
this looks iconic
he deserves everything
my timmy
I'll hold out for Wonkapocolypse.
"I feel that everything is way too whimsical, which it really takes away from Wonka’s presence. This prequel version of Wonka seems um.. too short. Timothee Chalamet looks very sugar/ drugged behaved with his portrayal of Wonka. The Oomph Loompa was really the only thing I liked."
This trailer is well made. I will surely watch this
omg🥰🤤❤❤❤
"Using the same formula as Cruella, ill pass."
Mr. Bean! Yay! I love Rowan Atkinson!
❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
it's giving Mary Poppins Returns
Okay I never thought  there would ever be a more suitable casting for Wonka after Johnny Depp but Timothee proved me wrong and Hugh Grant as oompa loompas ohmigod take my money
Wait u telling me they didn’t make wonka black ?oh nvm thats why
That Oompa Loompa looked disturbing but familiar.
who up wonking they willy
music copied from Godzilla King of the monsters trailer ?
"more like ""WONKY"""
is my eyes good did I see Mr Bean
I swear someone posted this as a Bloodborne movie. WTH!
awww looks cute
I always knew Willy Wonka was American.

"Looks absolutely horrible. Terrible performances, lifeless production design. Just lazy, cheap and unnecessary."
Why though?
"Oh Johnny Depp, i really missed you.
You are the best in the class.
Although this child is not bad at all."
Please tell me that’s Rowan Atkinson as the priest! 😃
"Can't wait to see a bunch of orange Hugh Grants being enslaved by Willy ""Whacky"" Wonka."
I simp HARD for Charlemagne...but....but...I don't know if I can believe he is Wonka...
"Happy to see ,Sir  Rowan Atkinson.  Love chocolates forever 😊"
Looks like fun
"Hollywood is so out of ideas they have to milk old stories for all they are worth.  This doesn't have any atmosphere of a Roald Dahl character, this is so saccharin."
Yup nothing surprises me now ...I just saw Hugh grant as oompah lumpa😮
It looks so polished broooo
"Whoa😎😎 AMAZING ❤❤❤I have Read This Story In my ENGLISH LITERATURE...
Would Really Love To Watch This Movie.....❤❤❤🎉🎉"
He makes chocolate and this movie is an autobiography of Mr. Beast
I feel dead inside.
"Hahaha - “Nothing to see here, just a group of people defying the laws of gravity.”"
Lol going straight to streaming
Never tell an American (Wonka) you can't do that.
This should be interesting. :)

When I saw Rowan Atkinson my heart skipped..This is going to be legendary
"I dare say, this looks surprisingly delightful.  I do not want a Willy Wonka prequel, but now.... now, I'm intrigued."
This looks soulless 😭
I'm still undecided.
"Oh okay, I've been wanting to watch Timothy chamalalamadingdong in something I can enjoy! Definitely giving this movie a shot! 😮"
"Well, Johnny Depp version still my fav"
"“From the director of paddington”
Okay, I’m sold."
"Good to Rowan Atkinson❤ (Mr bean)

No Jonny 😢
NO ONE CAN PLAY WILLY WONKA BETTER THAN JOHNNY DEPP
BOX OFFICE FLOP FOR SURE
I gotta see more of Timothy chalamet's Films
Yeet yeet skrtt
YEA GENE WILDER IS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE
Oh dear.....
NOW IS THIS A PREQUEL TO GENE WILDERS FILM OR WHAT BECAUSE THIS LOOKS SO SO SO BAD
Was hoping Johnny Depp would play Wonka as he did before
"Okay, I’ll admit I was one of the cynical ones (I almost always am), but right now, I’m seeing Gene Wilder looking down and watching this trailer from up there. He’s smiling, a single tear rolling down his eye. He’s as happy and excited as I am! 🥹"

Good god... Hugh Grants voice is genius for the Oompa Loompa but that face... It looks so weird 😂
"I guess the girl dies before the events of 1970 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because she looks like a major character and I don't recall her being in that one. I'm getting strong ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" vibes from this. Remember ""Oz the Great and Powerful""? Yeah. Wish I didn't either."
Wait did I see Mr beans 😐
Looks promising!
Finally a movie that base only on willy Wonka
I'm still quite skeptical about this but I quite like what I saw in the trailer
THIS IS ALREADY THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER !!!🎉
looks like a fun watch
돈많고 달달한 자본가를 초콜릿 공장으로 표현...천재적이야!
If the chocolate river doesn't look like pure garbage is it even wonka?
At first I thought it was a remake again
"His performance as Wonka is so undeniably cringe and violently underwhelming. Good idea for a film, awful choice for the main lead. He doesn't suit the role at all."
Do we really need a full story of Willy Wonka? Yes!
I love that this is different from the original movie and Timothee is making the character his own while still respecting Gene's classic take on it.
"from dune to wonka, this man is something else 🎉"
A Pinkie Promise is the Best Promise
"Этот трейлер так похож на что-то родное и душевное, на фильмы до 2020, на Гарри Поттера, Властелина Колец... Чувствуется какая-то реальная магия, причём под новый год самое то🎄☃️"
"if this is made by the same people who made Harry Potter and directed by name person who directed Paddington, than it must be a good movie

also, correct me if m wrong, but the woman at 1:51, I think she's the same actor who plays mrs brown in Paddington"
Wow
"Wow, these comments are all bots."
"BLACK LIVES MATTER, if your a indigenious person fck off."
"Timothee Chalamet is such a joy to watch, this looks like it'll be a good movie i just wish trailers these days didnt show off the entire plot of the movie"
"The movie looks horrible, but Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is wonderful"
Who up wonking they willy rn?
But didn't he see the oompa in the jungle??
"I know people aren't always in favour of original prequels or origin stories for iconic characters outside of their source material, but at least this will be more entertaining than most Disney movies in recent years so hopefully it will be worth watching."
"yeay its not johnny depp, im scare whenever i watched him as wonka, he is like my nightmare clown character"
Interesting lol
No no no and no. I can't see Chalamet's face in another movie.
Oof. Timothee Chalamet is drowning.
Wonka - Depp
0:20 thats what she said
This just proves that Hollywood cannot come up with anything new
@ayumichelle
"I never would have thought, that there will be a prequel."
When it's going tooooooo releaseee!! 😊
I'M EXCITED FOR THIS AHHHH
"You can't prequel Willy Wonka, this is Garbage, it's a shame Hollywood cant be original & come up with something new. The only thing Hollywood is good at today is being a propaganda machine for the Left. They've delved so deep into Political Agendas that they forgot how to do the job they were supposed to do. At least Gene Wilder didn't have to witness this."
"The genius of Marketing made the controversial logo which could be read in Cyrillic in an entertaining way (ЖОПКА) sorry, I couldn't keep it from you"
Looks good!  Think I’ll be a seeing this one!
Yesssssssssßssssssss
This seems genuinely awful.
"""I'm something of a magician, inventor, ...""  You can tell how hard he's restraining himself from saying the word ""scientist"".  Don't fight the meme magic, Wonka!"
Timothy plays onceler who plays wonka
They certainly fulfilled all the black diversity quotas with this wonder of Hollywood compliance work.
This looks really good!
OMG Timothee 😍
It was looking good until I saw Mr. Bean and then it started looking amazing.
bad .....
New Wonka Movie In Cinemas Soon!
I’m not sensing the dark nature of Roald Dahl. This is coming across like a male Mary Poppins.
Of course the lead kid is black and a girl
Lost all the charm.
My daughter's crush❤❤
Another one?
"Ah, yes. Lets take the guy known for playing quiet, reserved characters, and cast him as the most over-the-top character in movie history. What a great idea!"
"Miss you!
Johnny Depp! ❤"
"1:02 Everyone was focusing on Choco bean but am I only noticed our Mr. Bean 
expecting  more from this wonka like Johnny Depp's one"
I can't wait for this movie
another one
"Oooh it looks so good! But ngl, Timothy Chalamet low-key giving Daniel Thrasher vibes and I'm here for it"
"hey , I cant write new material , you know what lets pull out old well love material out of a Hat and remake it ."
Ummmm.... not quite what I was expecting
"Honestly I knew this movie would be good but this trailer has over exceeded my expectations! As someone who grew up watching both Chocolate Factory films (Saw both in elementary school, I'm 19 now) I'm very excited to see Chalameys take on the character of Wonka!"
DIRECTOR OF PADDINGTON AND PRODUCER FOR HARRY POTTER??? THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING!!
Bring Johnny Depp back
"haha, жопка"
the right cast
Hoverchoc is such a silicon valley startup name
what Mr Bean
um why is there another one?
Snow piercer was a great sequel
This made me smile 😊 childhood 🔓
I would love to watch this while eating candy with my Auntie & my girlfriend  😋🍭🍬🍫
"Whatever you do 
You can't perform like sir Jhonny Depp"
I’m not gonna lie. This is not look very good.
kids are gonna love this movie so much. we really are in need of wholesome movies like these ❤
I will def be watching this. Seems like a perfect holiday film.
Прадедушка Элмер здарова я твой наследник престола
Let's see....🤞🏻❤️
Was skeptical but this looks really good. Great choice for casting too!
Wow Timothy Chalme was HORRIBLE casting for this. He’s always such a dull zero charisma actor. You can tell he’s trying WAY to hard in this. Hugh grant is awesome throu
Movie looks good but honestly timothee doesn't stand out for me. His face n coustome doesn't really reflect wonka to me. He looks more timothee than willy wonka.
This will be a new Christmas classic❤
Willy Wanka is back.
"I watched some of this be filmed in bath it was super cool, it was right outside primark lmao"
"How is chalamey in everything. I love him, but to be honest it's getting kinda annoying."
Charlie and the chocolate factory my favorite ✌🏻😌❤️
So happy for you Daniel Thrasher! How cool!
"I'll give the movie a chance because it looks interesting, but what's up with the T&A pfps in the comments?"
"After this, Willy goes on to murder multiple children!"
"This trailer is stupid for basically spoiling the whole movie.
But it looks pretty good and I like how it’s supposed to be a prequel to Gene Wilder’s version. (I don’t like Johnny Depp’s version)"
WONKA is back again 
"Idk, it looks cute but Im not so sure about Timothee being Wonka. I havent seen anything else he's in but people seem to like him so I cant completely say that he's not right for the role, just this trailer didnt completely sell him to me. Ill definatly be watching cause the rest looks awesome. And who knew we needed Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa, he looked cute!"
"I will be honest, i prefer the anti social dark willy Wonka (not cuz its johnny depp, its the way hes actually portrayed and it makes more sense to me in my opinion. In the first place he didn't have the best father figure so it shows why he wouldn't be exactly heartwarming to any1 unless you are some1 like charlie bucket or just a good person in general) and i lowkey find it funny when he gets awkward from socializing with others"
Hugh Grant is hilarious
This movie looks so stupid
Alan Johnson!? Chance would be a fine thing!
I guess we call him Oompa Loompa Grant now.
So would this ignore the one with johnny Depp?
"‪I honestly can’t tell which of the two Wonkas they are usually for this film, cuz I can see the original due to the Oompa Loompa and how they are usually Pure Imagination as background music but at the same, Timothée resembles more to Johnny than Gene‬"
"I can even to begin with my excitement for this movie.. Hugh Grant? ... AS AN OOMPA LOOMPA!??? 



yes please."
Gene Wilder just rolled over in his grave
I think the movie town of Chillingbourne would have made a better backdrop.
I’ve been watching Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory and Charlie and the chocolate factory a lot of times but I’ve been waiting for the trailer to start and it’s finally here
"I want to watch it just because of Rowan Atkinson, nothing else :D"
running Rowan Atkinson always makes me a day ;)
😮‍💨😮‍💨I cant wait ‼️
Omg I can’t wait ❤😂
"I love everything about this except for Timothee. He just seems like he's phoning it in.  He just doesn't have that whimsical, quirky, endearing charm that Gene had."
I can't wait!!!
"A Paddington style Willy Wonka prequel?
Hmmm, we'll have to see..."
Who noticed music?
Here we go momma @ 1:49 made me bawl
Who would've guessed Willy Wonka went to Hogwarts
Seems good
"Not the Snowpiercer prequel I was looking for, but it looks still amazing"
"So he sold his superior product but had to compete with the Cartels, I wonder if he knows Walter White."
Solo: A Wonka Story
"Can’t say this has sold me on Chalamet as Wonka. He feels like a guy pretending to be eccentric, it feels too forced. I’ve always loved Gene Wilder’s more reserved and quirky take on the character."
WOKE........ BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Question will be : How Wilbur gonna act when he saw this ?
Watch this and the Dune 2 trailer back to back 💀💀
"Mathew Baynton from Horrible Histories is in this??? 

That's the only reason I'd watch this."
I can see some really fascinating movies coming from WB in the next 10 years
"This looks like a tragedy. I bet these are great performances with the most mediocre, rote, safe mainstream script ever,"
OMGGGG I’m so excited for this movie
I wish this was a series this will definitely hit

"with British accent ""you Wonka"" lol"

1:17 Those idiots hired the most gullible prison guard ever as a police officer
Wtf....it went woke!
"This looks awful, what are the comments. Generic as heck and Timothy does NOT sell it as Wonka"
Mr. Bean had be laughin' 😂
"I was a bit skeptical of Timothee Chalamet being Willy for this movie but after this trailer, yeah I'm convinced he might be the best iteration of Willy Wonka"
wow....this looks amazing
"This actually looks magical, whimsical, and fun. I will say though it seems to be missing...something. A spark. Timothee actually looks great, I've just seen pictures of him and he always looks mopey and anemic. Hope it's a huge success."
egarly wwaiting
Goodness. Can you come with anything original?
Works for me!
"Not going to lie, I had my doubts lol but this looks awesome! Timothy is on a role 👏🏻"

"Okay so it’s not another remake it’s an actual prequel where we get his back story. I’m down to watch it, also I love Timothy so"
Wow wasn’t expecting this trailer or cast. Loved it. All favorite comedic actors together. American and British 👏 👏 this can’t be missed🎉
Nothing like original but hey this isn't remake so good luck
"I'm not a fan of dance numbers in modern movies, they just seem too exagerated and fake to me, but apart from that it looks good."
What is this garbage!?
Honestly Matt Smith would’ve made a great Wonka
The great glass elevator as a sequel would have been better. Im sorry but fighting shapeshifting monsters with Willy Wonka just makes sense. I could have done with out a prequel though.
This looks absurdly fantastic and wonderfully ridiculous
Not sure about TC’s casting as WW. His quirkiness doesn’t seem effortless as was the case for Johnny Depp. 😞
here is an idea... stop with the woke bs and start using critical thought to come up with NEW ideas
"I didn’t know that this was a thing. I am so looking forward to it now. Again the trailer shows too much but still, it’s pure imagination and I can’t wait."
Looks bad alrready....
"I'll admit I was pretty skeptical when this was announced awhile back, but it looks genuinely fun and whimsical. And Timmy is giving off serious nutty-Wonka energy! He's so versatile in his roles, I love it"
another? hasnt this movie been made 3 times already?
"Obviously I know he's Willy Wonka, but he reminds me of Ace Ventura!😅"
WILLY WONKA
Bots are taking over youtube
"not sure if im exited for it but i hope it goes everything well, kinda magical for being willy wonkas universe but okay i guess"
anther one!??
"Wow did they really take jobs away from midgets to replace them with CGI people who arent even accurately sized? That's not very inclusive! 
*SHAME AND REEEE*"
Willy Wonka-movies are what great actors do to kill their careers.
Looks sooo bad
Im here for this masterpiece❤❤❤
Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory is a delightful and whimsical movie that sparks the imagination and takes you on a magical journey through a world of pure imagination. It's a classic film that continues to charm audiences of all ages with its memorable characters and enchanting storyline.🥰😍🤩❤🧡💛
I wonder if they’ll reference the train in any way. 😬
This looks utterly chaotic... and I'm here for it
Bruh why no one is talking about the running mr bean?
It’s so fun to see Timothée Chalamet in that kind of character!!! I’m so exited!<3
Not enough Joker Vibes. I wanted that Jonka Movie they promised.
Какое же говно!
should have made it futuristic.
Do anyone feel like this is set in potterverse and that Wonka is a wand less wizard
Toooo much black actors
STOP remaking the classics....Just ruining everything
nothing compares to gene wilder ...
"this genuinely looks so amazing I'm so happy to see timothée challenging himself in roles like these. it's unfortunate that so many people throw so much hate into anything this guy does, but I know this is gonna be a good movie. Sooner or later people will have to accept that this guy is an amazing actor and is here to stay"
Paul Atreides sniffed so much spice he hallucinated he's a candy maker 🤣😂
So I guess every actor on Earth is unavailable for the role of Wonka
"So what are our thoughts on this movie, is it gonna be good or bad 



Let the comment war begin"
Timothée is an Actor’s ACTOR… The best of this generation. We’re so lucky to see his work real-time in our lifetime ❤️
"1. Timothee Chalamet's acting seems weak here.
2. The casting of the extras and supporting cast seems forced and pulls you out from the historical time period the setting is meant to convey.
3. The comments section seems to be filled with paid bots."
finally........the new Mr.Bean movie!
Timothy Chalamet as Timothy Chalamet!!
where r his daddy issues 😮‍💨
These AA diversity actors kinda ruin the authenticity of these types of movies. Talk about whitefacing black actors. Automatically I lose interest. 😅
"Oh look another not original movie. Remakes, it’s all we get."
I hope it's good . I know as a 56 year old man ...I loved Willy Wonka as a kid .
When they first announced this I was sceptical. But know I'm here for it
why are there so many fake women here
Willy with elio longing Eyes
...enough of this Tim C overload...
I'm not sure if this will be a hit or a flop
"Next one:




Wilford"
"When they release the next Willy Wonka movie with both Timothee Chalamet and Johnny Depp.
Let's continue..."
timmy
Da SOYCH for more money!
Russians when they see the logo: 💀💀💀
Im here for my TIMOTHEE
I dont want or need this.
Ok even since I found out about this I’ve been extremely excited especially since timothee chalamet is playing Willy wonka. Can’t believe I have to wait until December. It looks really good can’t wait. ❤
I wish it had a darker tone personally but looks pretty good. Glad to see a prequel and not a remake
Thank God Disney doesn't have the rights to this
really ?? I don't like it
Get an original story with original characters. Remakes 😴 “prequels” 🥱
This actually looks a lot of fun - I’ll give it a go. And Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa…genius casting. 👍
oh no
why is it so dark?? lmao
It looks a little too kiddy but I'm hoping my childhood is not butchered
Timothée fits this role so well
So proud of Timmy ❤
"Even if it's minor role, it's always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films. Can't wait to see this one, the film coptures the spirit of the source material so well❤"
He’s so fine
gg
No
ЖОПКА
I'm loving this interpretation already. Definitely will be checking it out. Director of the Paddington films!? Rowan Atkinson!? Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa!? All the ingredients for a successful Willy Wonka film imo.
I’m sure this’ll be great… but who asked for this?
I like Johnny depp version
Best ❤ I love it
Willy Wonka is one of my favorite fictional characters and this looks like a wonderful take for a prequel. Looks fun and magical.
"Is no one going to say anything about what a TERRIBLE casting choice this was? Chalamet has zero charisma, does not have the personality or range to pull off this character like a Wilder or a Depp. If this trailer is comprised of the choicest scenes they wished to highlight, I can only imagine how laughably bad the rest of the movie must be."
Mr Ben😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Oompa Loompas are way bigger than that in the og so I don’t think he IS a respectable size for an oop a loompa. I think he’s just short
Seeing the amazing cast of British actors I'm immediately sold.
Timothee Chalamet cannot act: Exhibit C
this looks absolutely horrifying
Timothy's Wonka impression reminds me of Fix it Felix from Wreck it ralph
"looks like its gonna be pretty average, chalamat is overrated. best part was hugh grant dancing at the end."
If this is a prequel do we get to see the creation of the LSD tunnel?
No Words to Say... Really Waiting For this Movie... I'm just Say it's Going to be Perfect 💕
0:47 why is he suddenly looking like daniel thrasher
"I'm more excited for the sequel tho
Wonka and the Mistery of the Chocolate on the bed"
Who up wonking their willy rn?
Oh Timothée is gonna knock this out of the park. So many kids will love him for this role aw
"this is the first retelling in a decade, I've actually been surprised and excited by when I saw the trailer."
This looks great but Timothee might be the weakest part of it.
"Wait, this actually looks good. It even gave me chills! Especially at 1:43!"
Only person who'd be a better fit than Timothée Chalamet would be Jesse Eisenberg
They just spoil 80% of the movie 😐
Why they changed the white boy for a black kid. When you do these changes I just don't watch the movie.
Love you Timothee😭
"this looks hideous, the worst cinematography i have seen in a while"
Just right after my birthday👌🏻✨
The only thing that makes me sad about this is knowing  all the people are gonna get fired
"Screenplay by Simon Farnaby and Mathew Baynton's in it too! 
Horrible Histories!!! Was my childhood."
I’m so excited
I’m def going to see this and Blue Beetle!!
"It’s crazy to see this is the younger Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka. Therefore, this comes before Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I may just check this out"
I’d like to Wonka his Willy
don't make this movie
"так круто , жду не дождусь❤"
December 15th?!??! thats my birthday lol
I'd say the most unrealistic thing about this movie is an american being a genius mastercraftsmen in chocolate...
No remakes. I beg you.😥📢
I am looking forward to this fr
Rowan Atkinson ❤🤩
Could be good if they leave  the WoKe rubbish out. Fastest way to ruin a film.
Omg I wanna see this
Oh how I miss Johnny 😢
Just why though?
Lord thank u so much 😭😭😭😭
Lest GO Willy Wonka
"By the looks of the cars, this movie takes place around the 1930s. Before 1960, England was 98% white, so why is half the cast of this movie black? 

I’ll tell you why. They are gaslighting the public with these movies into believing a false history that Europe was always racially diverse so that people won’t be alarmed by mass immigration."
Looks meh..
"i sometimes forget how many haters this man has. anyway, this better be released here in my country because i'd love to watch this on the big screen."
It’s not his role.
I hope they lean heavily into Gene Wilder’s sincerity and not how he was supposedly mad. He wasn’t. Johnny Depp’s WW was a travesty. Ugh.
Wah young Willy wonka?
Matthew Bayton?!!!
Go home frenchie
Hugh Grant is an Umpa Lumpa. Lmao
"WTF, how is there another Wonka remake already?  Are ppl actually interested in watching this? Bleh 🤢"
Have warner brothers made a decent film in the last 10 years?
This giving me Charlie the chocolate factory
"There was almost no effort channeling Gene Wilder's mysterious acting brilliance here, or Mel Stuart's directing approved by Dahl.  I think instead this is intentionally made for a 4 year-old crowd, easy, safe, and simple, where shopping-glazed moms can drop off Christmas-sugared tykes for a temporary respite.  Perfect for a toddler or younger."
Hugh Grant on such a roll for last couple of years. Getting old is best thing that happened to him as an actor.
"No one will beat Johnny Depp's version, like ever."
🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️🗑️😂😂😂
Why do the oompa loompas keep getting smaller with every movie?
"I'm very surprised this does not look like 💩chocolate, it more looks fun and charming. Good luck being good, movie, I'm rooting for u"
2:09 He looks like George Washington?
"So cool, I wonder if this is a Prequel to the Book, the Original Movie, or the JD Movie, or maybe it's own universe."
but not good as like Johnny does.
This movie is gonna bomb so hard. Mark my words. Looks boring af.
this the young version of Willy Wonka he's not replacing the one and only JOhnny depp
"Bah! The older he gets the more I think Lip Gallager looks a lot like a young Gene Wilder. I don't know if he has the chomps, comedy wise. But if he does he would’ve been my first choice."
The chocolate factory needs to be shut down! It's a death trap for kids! I made a whole video about this!!!
bro theres so much reboots coming out this year
No.
Nah no match for Johnny Depp's Wonka
"(John 3:16,17) ""For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believes in Him should not perish, but should have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but that the world might be saved through Him."" (Romans 10:9,10) ""That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. For with the heart, man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation."""
"One simple reason this is going to fail is the trend of pairing a young girl to the main character. It takes away from a story between the main character and his surrounding for a story between the main character to the young girl, which these days is just pandering."
"Would’ve been better without forcing diversity down our throats, it’s just annoying by now."
"""He's good. He's too good."" Me at every character Timothee Chalamet plays."
"""He's good. He's too good."" Me at every character Timothee Chalamet plays."
Uh..no.
"Not another old fashioned movie, it’s Willy wonky for gods sake"
Made me slow the video down. That's beauty!
Ok this is gonna be good.
This is the cinema ✨
Johnny depp would have killed it
The brits make the best movie and *(REDACTED)* videos
is everyone here a bot? you guys all sound the same. Open your machine eyes and see that this movie looks and smells like hot garbage
"No need for prequel or Gene would have done one - he would be rolling in his grave that people are just milking his original magic. Surely there is more original material out there than doing remakes, prequels and sequels."
HERE WE GO MAMA
Great another remake! I guess Hollywood is out of fresh ideas. The writers should stay on strike; maybe then some new hungry writers can finally get a shot at getting their script approved for a movie
bean is there you it gonna be epic on top of that it is produced by harry potter producers
Yay the old style oompa loompa!!!😊
gonna be mid
ЖОПКА
"Here we go Mama, gave me goosebumps"
"imma be honest, No One Can Replace Jhonny Depp."
what happened to sticking to the storyline? meh
Gonna be honest...tiny green-haired Hugh Grant is rather terrifying
Will he be campaigned for Best Actor? He seems so good as Wonka. 👏
Жопка 😂
I have to wait until December? Thats not fair
Most charming version of Willy yet
Another classic that becomes woke
Rowan Atkinson...my heart🥰🥰🥰
Paddinton 3 here we come.🎉
"The comment section is full of bots. Fake reviews, fake engagement to make the trailer feel impactful. Looks shite."
Does this mean we’ll get Wonka Bars back on shelves for a limited time? 🤓🍫
"Looks good, looking forward to seeing it."
So how did he start offing kids ?
"This looks better than the Johnny Depp one already, don't get me wrong I really like Johnny Depp... but it didn't use him to the best of his talents, to say the least.  I'm happy to see this going in a different direction on its own, and was amused to see the 'by the producers of Harry Potter', since it has been a community theory for a while that Willy Wonka was a rogue wizard. XD"
Jeremy Allen white was snubbed
"No one can replace Johnny Depp, fact"
My childhood 😢😢😢
this looks fun but was mr beans actor the priest
1:02 MR BEAN
So you have got to be kidding me!!!! They had 2 successful movies of which the second one became an adaptation of the original film and now they have made this movie WHY????
1:30 Mark Goldbridge is that you?
"Now I am intrigued 🤩

Edit: You replaced Johnny Depp 🤬"
This looks horrible
"Well, despite beeing not particularly fond of Timithée or the Willy Wonka-story in gerneral, I'm all in just to witness Hugh Grant as CGI-Oompa-Loompa!"
you wanna see Mr bean....here he is 1:41
It's a little unrealistic that Willy Wonka has a black sidekick considering the original story...
NANGIS
Nobody asked for this. Prequels to old IP's is lazy story telling and damages the mystery elements of what made the original story special to begin with. I hope the Hollywood writers strike never ends.
"hmm..... ok...nothing spec.. ""sees Rowan Atkinson"" .. yup Im watching the movie"
Never thought I wanted to see Hugh grant as an oompah lumpa. Hahaha. This movie looks full of family entertainment I can't wait.
i’m sorry but this does not look good
This cast looks stackkkked
no one can replace johnny depp as willy wonka <3
"yea nah, his voice doesn't suit the accent he's trying to pull off, sounds like he's constantly whispering"
"Is this the prequel of  Johnny Depp's ""Charlie & The chocolate factory ""?"
i miss mr johny depp
"I love both my Willy Wonka’s but I never thought of going back in time to see how it all began. However, I will still watch it as I love a spark of Wonka 😊"
terrible
I might actually go see this
Not my wonka
This Christmas is going to be filled with joy and chocolate
Wonder if they explain how he enslaved the Oompa Loompas?
That oompa loompa's Classic man. I love that
"Why are all the people in London speaking American? Except for the oompa loompas, who are not from London...🙈"
This actually looks interesting
"I saw the title and immediately felt a sudden sensation of disgust.  I found the original delightful but the remake, despite being a fan of Mr. Dep, a huge disappointment.  Honestly there is just no point in remaking a classic.  But out of a sense of morbid curiosity I decided to watch the above trailer.  I confess I am actually optimistic about this film.  If it's half as good as the trailer it will be a classic.  I honestly can't wait for Christmas."
I like the new Peter Pan
Isn’t the Oompa Loompa supposed to be South Asian
Mr bean 😍😍
Timothee just doesn't seem to be giving off the wonkiness that comes with being Wonka.
Finally Charlie and the Chocolate Factory PART 2!!
gila
Run away!! - Mr bean 2023
"Damn, YouTube comments are just bots. Not a single comment on about how weird Timothys acting is?"
They just won't stop with these willy wonka movies
Is it based on a real story?
"Didn't he meet the Oompa Loompas in a jungle, though?"
Idk..;
"I really loved Johnny Depp's version of Wonka... as whimsical as this seems, I don't think any Willy can out Wonka him. he was seriously so funny in that movie."
😭😭😭
They didn't get it with black mermaid?
so magical
"My biggest concern, what I would assume the entire movie will ride on, is if Timothee will be IMITATING Wonka, or making him his own. If it's just an impression, it's not going to work at all.

The oompa loompa scene gave me hope, though. Hahaha."
"awesome 
"
🔥🔥💪
Looks horrible
Who's the black girl?
I can never see another person playing Wonka besides Gene Wilder.
Hmmm a wonka origin film? Im in!!!!
The most boring looking Wonka rendition yet.
probably not going to watch
Ben 10 live action movie😢😢
Johnny Depp Does it Better... Sorry Team...
Leave Roald Dahl's work alone and come up with your own IP.
Whaaaaat! No daydreaming for golden ticket?!
This is going to AMAZING
diversity hire
"Didn't know I wanted to see this, looks super fun! I'll definitely be giving it a watch!"
I was sold when I saw Hugh Grant was cast as an Oompa Loompa.
Dumb.
Wait. Was that Rowan Atkinson or I'm just hallucinating?
"Tim Burton direction & the cast in his Willy Wonka film was well done and the surprise was very interesting... This new version is just plain bad, there's no surprise to it, it's all in the trailer, very disappointed casts"
"For me, Timothee Chalamet is always 17yo."
"If this film play the original ""pure imagination"" it will be wild"
I forgot this thing was still in production
I didn’t ask for this but I’ll take it I suppose
Please no …… nooooooo
What? Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa?? Another example of a big celebrity getting a role an actual midget could've gotten. Boycott this movie!!!
"Eh. I was NOT expecting this tone & direction at all. This is veeeeeery geared towards kids & family.  Not my cup of tea. I thought it'd be in that darker, weirder vibe like the one w/ Johnny Depp."
quirky timothee chalamet instead of playing teen indie boy? i love it so much
excited for this...✨
Bro if Johnny depp was playing as winks again it would be cool
Let’s hope it’s not Woke
"Forget Dune, the real holy war in Timothee's name we need is about chocolate"
"I l-o-v-e the way Timmi talks to Oompa-Loompa, he is just adorable 😍"
No one beats Johnny dep
BRO IS THAT ROWAN ATKINSON OH MY GOSH
lot of blacks in ye old England 🤔
TIMOTHEE YOURE GONNA MAKE A GREAT WONKA <3
They got it wrong ist Olly Wonka😂
i miss Johnny Depp
Christmas Gift🎉
WokeY Wonka is more like it. Does Hollywood NOT realize there are more than 2 races in the world? smh 🤦‍♂
Timothee is the best chocolate ever! 😍
so magical
Finally some material to pad my Willy Wonka lore wiki
He's doing it for his mom <3 That's reason enough for me to watch it.
1:41 the legendary Actor ❤❤❤
"this seems very very promising, im quite excited"
this comes out on my birthday
Omg I can’t wait to see thissss🥳 see ya in this Christmas 🎄
"Looks like Timothee Chalamet is going to *own* the holiday season with Dune Part Two AND Wonka! Good for you Timothee, enjoy the ride. 😊👍"
This is going to be so bad
No thanks.
I liked Timothy but I don't believe his gonna handle the role. I cannot see in him any of Johnny's or Gene's crazy vibes.
*Do they mentioned that Willy Wonka actually stealing the recipe and enslaved Oompa Loompa natives like White colonialists do?*
"i saw his mother talking and i cried, why ? idk 😅"
We already have 2 movies 😂. But it looks cool :)
Remake..... Remake everywhere..... no more new ideas....
"This looks so dam awful.  ""LOOK GUYS IM ACTING QUERKY!!!!"""
Can't wait for this adventurous film
Nepo baby is over taking ha....
I Love the soundtrack!! And that the mom from Paddington is here!!
At first i was a bit skeptical coz wonka seems a bit too happy and positive than he was in the original one. But then i realized that wonka is much older and spent decades in that factory without anyone except Oompa Loompas. So this makes sense
Tbh dosn’t look that bad
oh Mr Carson! cool
I kinda wanted arnold to be the umpa lumpa uh uh
"I don't know. Until now I loved Timothy in every single role he took, but nothing he does here feels ""natural"". I don't think that Wonka is his character at all."
rowan atkinson?!! Okay!!?? But HUGH GRANT????!!! OKAY???!!!
Has to be better than the tim burton one but nothing compares to the original and gene wilder. This actually looks good
"johnny depp did an amazing job in the first movie
I miss him in this"
Why watch a movie about a candy monopolizer and an oompa loompa trafficker. I need to see them immigration papers sir
This actually looks terrible. Can't wait to read about how hard it flops.
"mr bean is back,cant wait to see this one"
Why are the comments so positive? This looks so bad.
Looks awful
"He’s a good actor, but Mr. Depp was indeed the best out of the actors to play Willy! Again, this young man is good, but by this this trailer his character is giving me more “The Greatest Showman” vibes than Willy’s vibes!!"
why is always have to be woke?
Interesting
"I'd love to see a movie about the beginnings of Willy Wonka, but this one just ain't it."
"Oh thanks god its prequal!! I never have digest one more remake of same movie. BTW looks good, the forgotten kid from Interstellar looks cool as young Wonka"
Looks awful.  He's a terrible Wonka
That's a hard pass
Funny trailer.
This story looks stupid but I'd like to see Tim dance..that's it...
Oh it looks like the perfect movie for Christmas time even if it’s not related to Christmas hahahha
WHY DID I CRY WATCHING A TRAILER
"How Willy Wonka became amazing.
I thought they were coming out with another one"
Rowan atkinson❤
😲 wow 🎉
timothees versatility in acting is insane
"Wow this cast is magical, it looks very very fantastical. Didn't know I wanted to watch this but here we are"
This Willy Wonka does not have enough presence compared to Gene Wilder.
So now they're gonna put this guy in everything
Looks cool can’t wait. Keep this show alive and well .
I CAN NOT WAITT! So excited
Im underwhelmed. I love Chalamet but this just didnt do it for me. I grew up with the original Wonka movie with Wilder so maybe im not giving this a chance but i didnt feel any excitement watching this trailer
No thank you
"i hope this does well coz  we are getting a remake but a prequel.this may start new trend grt for us audience.everything looks good  hope it is not  slow  n boring.,"
the rendition of the song tho
"lol, no thanks"
"Absolutely lost it when Willy says ""This is gonna be the greatest chocolate shop the world has ever seen."" 😭😭"

Closure for this film has to be him shutting off the world from his factory a broken man.  I'm not one for a downer but this can be the only ending to this movie.
DIS COOL
"Trying so hard to be quirky and funny, this movie is going to be godawful"
Not the exact charm !!!
"Nothing like the original
 Millennial rubbish"
Dont u dare ruined my childhood timothee!! Cant wait!!
Timothee is new Leonardo DiCaprio 😅
"""Every good thing in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours."""
a willy wonka prequel wowsers
And when does start the part in wich he murder kids?
Bless!

why isnt he black? 😂😂😂
"So who here, misses johnny depp 😢"
"Because of Jonny depp, willy wonka became my favorite movie character all time. In my childhood and also as a adult,  wonka is my favorite. Can't wait to watch the masterpiece."
"From spice to coco.

Chocolate must flow."
Not a huge fan of Wonka but this actually looks fun to watch.. I mean Mr. Bean!? Cmon now
@1:50 anyone peep Mary Brown from Paddington? happy feels :)
Only for rowan atkinson
"It's official, every major studio is out o new and fresh ideas!"
NO WAY NO FREAKING WAY! ❤ I had NO idea this was coming. This is the first I’ve seen or heard of this rendition of the Willy Wonka story. This looks so fresh and such a different take on the material.
He’s not giving wonka I’m sorry
This is gonna perform poorly.
Barf
That one frame of Rowan Atkinson has already got me hyped
Looking forward to this snowpeicer prequel.
They got the oompa loompa size wrong.
"I love how Timothee Chalamet is paying homage to both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder when it comes to his take on Willy Wonka. So excited to see his full version of wonka, based on what I see in this trailer, he already is amazing!!!"
Жопка...
"It looks good, but I think Johnny Depp does a better job"
"oh boy, woke wonka xD"
So is no one going to mention that a particular Historical actor that helped shape a generation within all countries that had access to the BBC and ABC?
Looks really good😍👌
I’m excited to see this and I hope it lives up to expectations
MORE TRASH...
I think I saw Rowan Atkinson (Mr. bean)?
This seems so promising and magical ❤❤❤❤
Timmy timmy timmy😭♥️
Awwwww ❤❤❤❤❤
"He's like the Johnny Depp Jr. those jawline are so cartoonish, we need more Tim Burton films with this guy!"
"Timothy is the worst choice for Wonka, sorry."
"Thats who Kylie, left Travis S. for.. From the movie Bones & All"
hehehe Hugh Grant is so adorable!
"You know what, why not, just dont mess it up warner bros"
Bollix
"Joker, Cruella, and now Wonka. The holy trinity is complete."
Timothée Chalamet is actually the perfect person to cast for this role. Kudos to the casting director
Why???
Can’t stand ya
Imagine if they had cast Charlie Puth as Willy Wonka.💡
Terrible
Suddenly and stupidly Willy Wonka is american. Why???
TIMOTHEE WE ARE SO EXCITED THIS SHALL BE AMZING!!!
something doesnt feel right
"can i say loud ""WOW"""
This is already as bad as the Burton movie
Dance numbers! I love a film with dance numbers
"""Who wants a Chocolate that makes you fly?"" well that's very subtle....."
I am old enough to remember when trailers got you exited for a movie without being a timelapse that summarized the full movie. The better old days...
"Wonka: “F* Prodnose, F* Ficklegruber, and F* Slugworth!  I bury those cock-a-roaches!”"
Another film with only black and white main cast actors. Typical little black girl sidekick for protagonist.
But will they bring back promotional Wonka bars?
Wow!!
Ohh Mr. Bean😂
"I know there's a sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, always thought they'd make that one, The Glass Elevator. Didn't expect a prequel"
i never thought I'd find Willy Wonka hot. Welp.
"MATT BAYTON????
AND ROWAN ATKINSON??"
"0:41 that was a beautiful moment usually seen in cartoons, the way the audio works with the dialogue to create a soothing combination."
1:42 bro is that rowan atkinson
If you can't see originality died and people can't come up with something better than copying the work of others then by definition you are blind.
"""What are we gonna do, Willy?""
""Huh""
""Huh?""

""A double-huh""

We just gonna retcon his dad in the 2005 Tim Burton movie or

1:42 Did i see Mr.Bean running around ?

im very exited to see timothy acting outside of his normal range
That magic chocolate's likely molds grown on the seeds before it was processed resulting in a magic mushrooms effect.

Nope
Hey That’s Paul Atreides 🤣🤣
"Have conservatives started calling it ""woke"" yet? That train is never late."

"Oh Snap! It’s Mr. Carson.
Yeah I’m in."
Oh. I love the direction this is going.
He resembles a young gene wilder. And I honestly think he'd be proud.
Genuinely looks good ❤
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lumpa is the best part of this - I like how they look exactly as they did in the 1970s film
The original came out and they have been trying to copy its success ever since. You cant beat the original. Try as they might. The original will always be the best.
Charlie and the chocolate factory. To make a chocolate factory. Bringing back the feel of Johnny depp.
"Well, its a corporate cash grab but with some genuine talent and imagination involved. Worth a check"
Hmm. I think the main actor is finding his rhythm. It might actually be good🤔
This looks incredibly stupid.
I expected Depp in this trailer
Reel State was here.
CANCER. I’d rather watch gene wilder or Johnny depp 100x before I watch this
1:41 Legend ❤
I'm getting emotional. I love Timothee so much! 😭😭😭
I CANNOT WAIT for this movie 🤎🤎🤎
Oscars incoming ❤
They got Mr Bean in it😊👍🏻
I AM SO EXCITED
"No one will ever be better than Johnny Depp, but I still wanna see it."
"Eat your heart out, Tim Burton...💀"
I cant wait to see children drown in chocolate only for the oompa loompas to celebrate
this looks like forced pretense of magical moments... or cliche vomit.
who up rn wonking they willy?
Hopefully this is rated r
Enough.
A dry witted oompa loompa? Yes please
"The ""no daydream"" scene reminds me of when young Wonka in 2005 movie passing by world flags in a museum, imagining himself travelling around the world, until he stopped by security tell him the museum already closed"
Closer to the Gene Wilder Wonka I hope.
me saw rowan atkinson
A little boy plays wonka. Tf
This already looks like an absolute delight. I love it!
"Can’t wait to watch young Willy Wonka’s journey!😊
Edit: I see Mr. Beeeeeeen!"
Literal unnecessary movie
"Already getting the sense this, like the original, will have Americans in a London-y setting that is actually Germany. I still have no idea where the movie Wonkas take place."
Did i just see Rowan Atkinson 😂😂😂
happy to see rowan atkinson
"Visually, the film looks good. Timothée acting however looks bad and seems so forced! It's like he's trying too hard to be funny!"
Surprised they didn’t make Wonka black
Unoriginal movie ideas only.
Cant wait till they do the oompa loompa origin stories
"I thought this was a remake, thank god this actually looks interesting."
At first I thought Willy Wonka should be older.. then I realize it's a prequel. Interesting premise though. Looking forward to it.
Over the TC hype.
Looks great but chalamet’s performance looks a little cheesy which is surprising cause he was great in dune
Okay fine! Take my money! 🍫❤
I hope they pop the blueberry girl like a pimple again!
"Oh yeh after Johnny Depp ultimate flop rendition make, yet another third money maker to destroy a classic. Hene wilder and Peter outrun are the originals and the goats. If anybody wstches this you’re enabling this destructive behaviour by the movie industries"
"Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant!!! 
I'm can't wait to see this movie!"
"Although the range he has had in every role he's done is that of a ""brooding snobbish young man"", he is trying in this one, but he feels a bit... restrained. I get an ""Ed Wood selling his dream with a gun at his head"" vibe from him."
So wait is this or is it not the backstory of the same Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp?
PURE TRASH AND AN INSULT TO GENE WILDER!
I'm just happy Timothee doesn't fake a British accent PTL
This generation movies comedy and acting is just so cringy
Can we do something original for once?
"bad acting, disappointed"
This looks epically amazing <3 Love you Wonka!
Harry Potter In A Top Hat
why lm suddenly excited for christmas
Good. But not compare Jhonny depp. 🗿🗿🗿
"I hope this movie is as magical and whimsical as it seems! I just can't stop seeing Wonka as Timothee _trying_ to be Wonka, but I'm still excited to see how it turns out."
Timotheeee
"his voice is out of place, the acting comes across as too try hard"
And the Winner is......... WONKA
From the director of Paddington. Say no more I'm in
Interesting.
Unpopular opinion : He is overrated Af. He has the looks but acting talent is just average.
this has to be a dream.
Waited 18 years for this ✌
💖
Oh... this is gonna be terrible
"It’s so interesting to see some of these comments in current times praising Depp’s performance as Willy Wonka in comparison to Chalamet when Depp’s characterization wasn’t that even well received back then, especially with audiences that grew up with the Wonka that came _before_ him"
"The opportunity to see Timmy dancing and singing already had me sold on the
 movie, but this makes it look even more amazing than I'd imagined."
This better be good.
"No offense but are they really going to do this?keep churning out another wonka,cinderella,ghostbusters,planet of the apes every 6 or 7 years?"
Fail. He’s the modern day Lief Garret.
I just wished we could see Jim Carrey as Willy wonka
"I wasn’t sure, but I kind of like it. Can’t wait to see it."
Timothée Chocolatemet
"0:45 ""A double Han"" 😄"
Really hope we'll see ominous blueprints for the Wonkavator.
elio elio elio
damm lil mabu making movies now
WOOOWW I'll be looking forward to the movie...
I have a strong feeling that Timothy has created another amazing Willy Wonka
"doesn't really feel like Willy Wonka at all, but hopefully it will be a decent movie."
BAD.
Here’s the next movie of the summer. 😎☀️
Bomb can’t replace Gene
Damn what a stunning trailer
Noooooooooooooooo
Can we just say that Hugh Grant's career at middle-age is nothing short of amazing??
Nostalgia of old wonka
Vamos Warner  no nos decepciones  ...  que la película sea un éxito .. como lo hacía la vieja escula..
Can't wait to see the new Umpa Lumpas.
Was 100% right expecting Olivia Coleman in this..I'm actually shocked when she ISNT in a film made in the UK
Willie wonka 🌍
"Wonka feat. Mr. Bean ? 😁🎉
Amazing"
Sadly looks like a soulless cash grab. Still gonna watch tho cuz I don't know any better.
Looks terrible
we do not need the back story of every classic cherector. be orignal hollywood...
This is going to be awesome Rowan Atkinson was like runway ahahaha now this is the movie that I wanna see
jonny depp
1:28 You can hear a bit of Pure Imagination from here.
Hopefully count dooku can make an appearance we have the technology to bring him back from death the Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider it to be unnatural
That'll put that theory about Willy Wonka being a killer to rest.
recuerden su primera tienda ...
visuals looks great but acting nah.
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa broke me.
"No erradia la esencia del personaje .. haganlo un poco mas chiflado .. que sienta el personaje a la medida ...  
Se puede mejorar .."
Can you make something new not renewing movies over and over again.
It seems to be a wonderful movie for all who believing their dreams ❤‍🔥
Ini awal mula Wonka merintis.
ROWAN ATKINSON ❤️
Another movie that just proves Hollywood can’t come up with new original material anymore
is it Mr bean??? <3 i mean the priest
CAN’T WAIT!
I think the magic really fails when watching a movie with an actor that doesn’t change their appearance and looks the same as they did in their other movies. They didn’t do an Al Pacino Michael corleone into Tony Montana Scarface. Completely unrecognizable. But this just looks like “Hey it’s that guy from the movie Beautiful Boy dressed up as Willy Wonka” 🤷🏻
so freakin excited !!!!
definitely looks more interesting than the 2005 remake. I'm getting the same vibes as Mary Poppins Returns and that's a good thing as a musical.
Woke
This deadass looks lit
I am here only for my Timmy....i dont know what yall are talking about
Estate of Roald Dahl: welp....gotta replenish the trust fund somehow...call Hollywood.
This is truly the worst timeline.
"Why did they have to have a random black girl from the hood 😂, does everything have to be woke"
Ooh that looks real good but omg couldn’t stop laughing at Hugh grant the Oompa Loompas! Can’t wait to see it!
When the heck Village Roadshow Pictures distributed the 3rd movie?
timothee chalamet's willy wonka is good but no one can match johnny depp's willy wonka
I dunno. I am intrigued.
"Okay good to know this ia a film that knows it is goofy and silly, but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun. Not to mention the cast looks incredible, and the director has never actually made a bad film, so I got a good feeling about this one."
Dang this actually looks good
Wow after decades they are showing a kind of willy wonka prequel I'm not sure if I should see it.
Жопка
Are there no new ideas?
I will be seeing this exclusively for Hugh Grant's Oompa Loompa
They should've went with a different voice actor.
Pre teen girls are gonna go crazy for this movie
"When i saw this, i thought it was just another pointless Reboot. But it's a prequel? And it's made by the creators of Paddington & Harry Potter? Now I'm stunned!"
Timothy chalamet is a great actor. Can't wait to see this movie.
"Idc what anyone says, this looks dope"
Would be better without the British
"AAAAAAAA EU ESTOU FELIZ 
ESSE FILME VAI SER MTO BOM"
Snooze fest
I don't know why make an origin of a character whose charm has always been the mystery that surrounds him. Trite trailer and silly movie.
woke casting always takes me out of it
"sorry, but Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa sold me."
"“ once we’ve started, we can’t stop” already a classic line 👌"
Are there only 10 actors in Hollywood?
"""From the Director of Paddington"" I'm sold, those movies are cinematic masterpiece"
looks bad
"mty love you video, thanks very you 💕💕😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍😍"
at first i was like meh...then i was like meh and it ended meh...
wish Johnny made an appearance
weird casting
Wait so he breaks the cartel and becomes a monopoly?
This look feels good movie and a very forgettable one
This is going to make christmas even better that it usually is.
ok where is jhony depp?
Where is Jack sparrow
This made me so so happy!
I hope this flops
Oh this is actually precious! I can't wait!
Timothee can play a lot of things but this ain’t it.
that was too old looking and not cool even in the teaser.
His mom got me tear up instantly
"I'm surprised it wasn't Disney ruining another franchise this time, now reboots and live-action remakes are just becoming stale, common, and disinteresting. We barely get any original movies now like do people still write books and come up with their own stories? Or is that era over already? I could criticize some aspects of this, but I'll give it a chance just because it's not Disney. It looks decent."
"I will be watching. At first I didn't believe he'd be a good Wonka, but then realised that Timothee has a way of making his characters his."
"From the looks of it , this is gonna be grand ! The actors are some of the best ones , I have hopes for this !"
IF JOHNNY DEPP COULD HAVE BEEN FOREVER YOUNG. HE WILL BE FOREVER PERFECT FOR THESE ROLES.
Thank you for showing the whole movie. Saved me $7.
"honestly im very much surprised of how amazing this looks. it feels so magical and like such a wholesome movie, and its not a remake!! its a non canon prequel of one of the most magical and mysterious characters of lots of peoples childhoods (and its timothee chalamet, which i adore with all my heart hes so adorable)"
Why does Wonka have so many Africans? Sounds like it takes place in England?
Everyone gonna be shocked when Wonka skins the Oompa Loompas and makes them into war drums
timothee looks to cool to be willy wonka. he's not enough quirky or goofy for this role. johny depp really put the standards high since his portrayal was so iconic
Time to see Mr Wonka get some Oompa Loompas and make them drink fizzy little drinks
"This looks horrible, completely changed the feel of the previous ones. Timothy doesn’t have it in him for a role like this it’s still bland."
is that lil mabu
"Simply awesome to see my home city of Bath in England featuring in a big movie, epic."
I wanna see this!
"ngotha! innum ethana da edupeenga? 
aracha maave arachittu...."
Garbage
Im just watching this for chalamet. No jomo
"Producers of Harry Potter…😃
I’m sold.

This whole thing honestly looks magical and amazing"
Hugh Grant is a national treasure and has been perfectly cast.
After he escaped Dune?
Wow! This looks so nice! I'm so excited to watch it this Christmas! 😍
Another franchise ruined
Alan. Johnson’s. Beamer.
why im excited bcs ROWAN ATKINSON is here !
Six Idiots fans are feasting on this morsel 😄
"Rowan Atkinson as a priest, can't not see him as Mr. Bean yelling ""Run Away!"" as he is running away! Ace"
I wonder who is gonna play Sluggworth
"Rowan Atkinson Cameo, let's go ❤"
Warner Bros. Presents: JINGLE JANGLE 2!
"Honestly this is terrible. It's so predictable. Let me guess: guy with little resources and a dream faces immeasurable odds against existing tycoons, outsmarts them with cleverness, tycoons crush him, all hope seems to be lost, magic strikes, comes out on top, makes tycoons look like fools, filmed with expensive cameras, big crew, custom-built sets, expensive CG, borrowing from old already-successful story to ensure high box-office return based on familiarity, enhanced outfits from original success to derive further immediate familiarity, featuring one of the hottest actors right now who attempts to emulate the original (but is hired because they're one of the hottest actors right now), the storyline fills in gaps that weren't shown in previous stories so now everyone knows every detail, and the executive producers are convinced yet again that they can't go wrong and will make a profit on their investment. I get that it means more jobs for production crew, studio, etc. But....when the story of how a story gets to the big screen is substance-less, the story that comes to the big screen is too.

The original had a magical serendipitiy to it, cleverness, real character, brilliant ideas, excellent writing. This one cheaply borrows from old inspiration, is written terribly with no cleverness, and is just way too predictable, especially the ""epic-ized"" trailer remake. Big studios churning out these turds solely for sustainable profit are the reason the movie industry is making less and less quality motion pictures as a whole"
i just wanna see mr. rowan atkinson LoL
"this looks so fun and whimsical, Timothée chalamet really is a star."
his really good in that act
Wtf
"Lame .. stop going back, be creative Hollywood"
Its really gonna be a tough role to pull off by the actor after our minds are still enchanted by the mindblowing and crazy performance of Johny Depp as Willy Wonka.
Halmarchainwon
Oh no.
i thought i saw lalo salamanca on 0:31
It’s MR. CARSON!!! 😂
Confirmed...George Weasley is Wonka
don't need to watch the movie now.
Y’all just can’t help but support these studios and their endless reboots. Not watching
Wonka jadi ganteng dan muda ya apa dia bisa melucu
Was that Mr bean I saw??
GOOFY
How many Wonka movies will they make 🤔 😂
Now chop
OMG.  I will watch the movie just to watch Hugh Grant. He cracked me up in that teaser.
Timmy acting looks terrible for this silly movie.
Nah
This is too bad... The role was cast to the wrong actor. He doesn't hold a candle to Wilder or Depp. Warner bros blew it. Where's the edge? Wonka always had straddled the edge of being insane.
"Looks awful, but a lot of big stars signed up. 50/50 chance"
"Dang, i was kind of hoping Tom Hiddleston would play Wonka.  But i guess he might be too old for the role now"
"“He who controls cocoa production controls the universe.”
“Long live the Loompas!”
“May thy butter brittle chip and shatter.”
“To save humanity, one much venture upon a Golden Path/Ticket.”"
Innovative Entrepreneur vs Old-money Oligarchs
"Willy Wonka was in the middle of inventing all the things in his chocolate factory in the original. This version suggests he had the same ideas long ago, but it is clear in the original that he was in the middle of coming up with new ideas. Blah"
"When you hire people just because they shall make propaganda (woke) you can not expect any talent.
Therefor we just see reproductions of earlier success in stead of new good stories.
And even the success they manage to destroy because it scream PROPAGANDA! from the first minute."
I really hope chocolate chip Charlie is in the film 🤞🏼🤞🏼
finally something i can actually look forwards too
Wowwwww❤
... but why? Creatively bankcrupt? Unable to make anything original so just trying to milk known characters? OH YEAH! That's why.
"...Again? 
We already saw the work of Johnny Depp. Wouldn't you better like to create over redo?"
It’s finally happened. We have arrived at the place where there are literally no new ideas. 😢
Wonka is harry potter spin off
This looks terrible....boring.
we have a future oscar winner right here im so excited it seems a v-whimsical movie it's so cool!!
Awesome
I hope we get to hear pure imagination in this movie guys 😊
"Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson is Gold. Finally, finally, a good movie about one of my favorite childhood stories, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I am sure children will love this movie."
"Most movie of all time. I loved it when he said, ""it's Wonking time"""
No oompa loompas?
I'm not crying.
What is everyone’s thoughts on Timothy playing wonka? I personally am skeptical about it because I think Johnny deep played such a good wonka but maybe Timothy will come through?
Nope 👎🏽
Nope. No thanks.
They still haven't got Oompa Loompas book accurate
the charm depp had in the role it's hard to visualize any other in this
"i wanted to like it but i think timmy’s affect is so off. he sounds like he’s reading a book to children, rather than actually talking"
WOW!!!! 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Does this mean they'll put Wonka bars back in shops like they did a couple years back?
Disney is not making it. So there is a chance it will be good.
Can’t wait to see how many lgbqt people will be in this movie.
Glad to see that he got over his crippling addiction to Heroin and started making yummy treats
Hollywood's so woke that actual little people can't even get work as an Oompa Loompa because it's considered offensive now for some reason
eww
ROWAN ATKINS AKA MR. BEANS IS IN THIS MOVIE?! MUST WATCH
"""hey, I heard that you like oompa loompa. Tell me about oompa loompa origin""
Can we get that golden meme again from this movie?"
Trailer is fantastic
"I will consider it a remake, a entire full remake of the plot considering this many changes, or just a old wonka hallucination considering one of the inventions that appeared are one that just appear when he is old(and was on testing)."
"ngl, Robert Sheehan would've been perfect for this role."
"Um, why do they keep doing this. Gene Wilder's musical version of the book is the BEST. All these remakes are a fool's errand!"
Cool
"Seems like it could be fun. The CG on Hugh Grant is bad, though

Bride of Frankenstein did the effect better"
Uhh no this not it in my opinion 😂
Doesn't feel the same without Johnny Depp 🖤
"""I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquechable fire""
-Willy Wonka"
1:02 is that Mr. bean??
Hope this does well it looks orginal and actually decent!
I wasn't overly enthusiastic until I saw Rowan Atkinson as a priest. 😁😁😁
i dont know his acting feels very try hard annd not authentic
"Stop it, WB"
How many remakes do we need? The original story gave us all we needed.
Yes
"So, how is Woke Wonka gonna get outdone in this movie? Is a woman going to show him how chocolate is made while bastardizing his character to become a better Wonka? A bait and switch? Are they going to ruin Wonka like they did Han Solo, Peter Pan, Ariel, Luke Skywalker, and Indiana Jones? Um, yes they will! Modern Hollywood is disgusting."
Paul Atreides likes chocolate. Good to know.
"It's a great idea for a movie, but I was still skeptical about it. This made me less skeptical!"
No one can do it better than Johnny
How does this smell like chocolate?
Timothy is a brilliant actor
NOT A BLACK WONKA !!!
ЖОПКА
"Modern movies look cheap and artificial, no wonder the film industry is failing."
Willy 'Woke' na
It's giving Bernard from The Santa Clause and I'm here for it.
Looks absolutely dumb. Hard pass.
"I never had an ounce of interest in the real movies for this, but the prequel looks really good!"
But but but i want Augustus gloop! Lol
Rowan Atkinson? I'm in!
No one can beat johnny depp as wonka. Timothée is not favourable for this character.
Correct me if im wrong but isnt that the mother to the kid in the last willy wonka movie.
I like it when i wonka ma willy
How do I like my chocolate? Spiced.
Movie gonna end with him getting the factory
Darn... I'm intrigued
What the actual F?
Watch this flop
If Johny don’t play i don’t want to wach it.
Rowan Atkinson as a priest K I'm convinced ❤
rowan atkinson :D :D
Daniel thrashers alter ego is doing pretty well for himself.
Willy Wonka is a mad hatter and a wizard
"I hate it already...
Ya made a fantastical beasts rip off Willy Wonka origin  😂 treat us with some respect"
More revisionism... another one to skip.
Oh good. A remake of a remake. Just what we need to watch.
"I already can't stand it, but perhaps not everyone despises the idea of a (Figuratively) candy-coated Wonka story. Doesn't look like anyone is ever serious in it."
"Idk, I don’t think Timothee fits the role"
Who's willy wonka is it? Is it Gene Wilder or  Jonny Depp's  willy Wonka?
"OH BOY... How long is this Chalamet guy going to be Hollywood's golden boy? I've seen many of his films and this guy is a pretty average actor. Just the other day I saw a movie called Beautiful Boy and his acting was very cringe (Steve Carell is very good in that movie, by the way).
And it would be obvious from this trailer that he has no range. Chalamet's bad acting makes even that overrated Johnny Depp look like a top-notch actor. On top of that, I don't see Chalamet having a box office (Dune is super famous to begin with, so no matter who plays the lead, it will be a hit in its own right).
This movie is going to be a flop anyway and Hollywood needs to give decent actors bigger jobs."
They are trying to grab you by the member berries.
Another flop in the making
"I scrolled a long way through the comments and didn’t find anything negative. THAT is a sign you’re doing something very right. Absolutely can’t wait for this! I thought it looked fantastic, then I saw Hugh Grant and I lost my mind!!! December needs to get here quickly."
This gonna be boring y’all just wait
uhh origin before johnny depp old wonka movie
"I dont think im mad that they chose someone who looked literally like Johnny Depp but younger, but I also am very curious to know who else auditioned? Also its so weird that literally everyone in the trailer has an accent other than Timothy lol"
another crappy woke film
How many times are they gonna remake this movie???
Rowan Atkinson ❤
When I heard the concept a couple years ago I was like meh but I didn't know the Paddington connection! I loved those movies and will see this for sure.
"WOW, I can not wait to watch this in theatres. This trailer looks so good. Timothy fits perfectly in this role as a young Wonka."
"Sigh, well I guess if you're going to do the prequal thing, you better pick the better Willy Wonka to do that with. No one, I MEAN NO ONE, will ever be as good as Gene Wilder. But at least you didn't go with the god-awful Depp version."
1:03 1:43 *Mr. Bean*
Who out here wonking they willy?
"I thought for a sec that it'd just dip it's toes into the realm of insanity but remain relatively grounded but as soon as I saw Key , I realized they were going full on Norwegian Death Diving into it"
Hopefully it's not WOKE. We'll see.
"When the acting is that bad IN THE TRAILER, you know this was just a ""paycheck movie"" for everyone."
Rowan Atkinson 😍 😍 ♥ ♥
They better bring back the chocolate bars for this movie
"1:41  is that 
Rowan Atkinson?"
cringe
His appearance is like a cross between the first and second movie
I like how the Oompa Loompa is in the same style as the 1971 version. This feels like a prequel to Wilder’s Wonka.
Nobody asked for this.
Nope
such a miscast 😢
I wish I could dislike this
who are here to see Rowan Atkinson
was that Rowan Atkinson??
I thought this was a fake trailer.
no.
"I was never a big fan of Willy Wonka, but this trailer makes this movie look creative and unique, it has the feel of that movie magic that just isn't around anymore. This could end up being classic film."
This is dogshit I'm sorry I'm not falling for the bot comments
😽😽😽😽😽😽😽🍫🍡🍭🍬🍫🍫🍫
This is r rated?
Hey is that oompa have stewies voice from the family guy
"It’s “STRIKE that, reverse it”.
Not SCRATCH that."
Это просто имба сколько я ждал этот трейлер!❤
Finally after so long this looks good I’m actually wanting to see this in theaters
"Damn, there's bots everywhere here! More skin then a nude beach."
What a cast!!!
Is that... Mr Bean!!!? 1:41
Will always be Gene Wilder. Please stop.
"A better version:

 A young, ethical, ambitious, and talented chocolatier comes to a new city with dreams of success and making people happy through his confectionary. 

His rapid rise only makes the subsequent fall that much harder as he realises that success and ethics are at odds with one another.

He then begins to descend into seclusion and madness, down a dark spiral, where he enslaves the oompaloompas, defeats the chocolate cartel and becomes the most successful (yet destroyed) chocolatier the world has ever seen

fin"
Glad to see Rowan Atkinson. My all time favourite. ❤❤❤❤
Gross
Mr bean huh
Hopefully this film isn't “woke” and full of virtue signaling.
What. This actually looks good. Nothing like the book and it kind of works better for this kind of adaptation because its not trying to compete with the original film - instead it focuses purely on the whimsicality that made you believe Wonka was the greatest candymaker to ever grace the page.
I’m guessing the little girl is his first victim
Woke.
How tf he giving me vibe like Daniel Thrasher 😂😂😂😂
"I grew up with the original, loved the Johnny Depp version, and I can't wait for this!!!"
Yippee
Ok. So this is CLEARLY an origin story for Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka from the 70s! STOKED!!!!
They should have kept the chocolate in the candy wrappers.
"HELP, I GOT A TIKTOK SAYING THERES GONNA BE A WONKA FILM YESTERDAY. AND I SEE THIS TODAY???? WHAT A COINCIDENCE"
2:17 this part is so funny lol
It's giving Disney Live Action remake /:
6 0ut of 10
Timothee Chalamet has something almost vintage about him! like an aura a vintage aura
Looks like fun :D
Rowan atkinson join the Willy Wonka chocolate
My days!!!!! This is a beautiful surprise!!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"Good Lord, the casting is amazing! ❤ Cannot wait for this one!!!"
"Well, this will bomb."
I didn’t realise I needed a Wonka prequel 🥲🤩
where's the signature hairstyle
"this amazing and to be released in the greatest time of the year, christmas ❤️"
My all time favorite movie. I was soooo excited for this. After seeing this trailer im disappointed. I was excepting to see infinite amounts of candy and a very colorful cinematography. Plus the guy playing wonka seems so bland. It hasnt checked even one box for me. Ill still give It a look once its on DVD.
"I relentlessly love the original, so naturally (and because Tim Burton's version was a hollow monstrosity), I was preparing myself to feel contempt and distaste for this trailer. But I really did enjoy it because it captures the feelings of Dahl's books. Dahl, of course, being the greatest children's book author of all time. Now, will this movie teach us about being healthy mentally and spiritually? We shall see."
who up wonking their willy rn?
I feel like Timothee Chalamet is too cool to be that weird... but we'll see
Uhhhhhhhhmmm….we’ll see
this feels like it was cast by a 12 year old tumblr user i love it
was Willy Wonka a wizard do you think? could that be canon...
love ya Timmy
Promising trailer
Where is acting?
"Well, color *me* _IMPRESSED (👏)!_"
"WAS THAT MR BEAN OR AM I TRIPPING 1:40 - 1:43  the ""runawayyy"""
"This looks like one of the best Willy Wonka movies I've seen, love all the ideas and charisma, can't wait 😁"
No one wanted this movie.
"so iconic, i love timothée"
soo exciitteedd! 🍫🍫🍫
hoping for a wacko but got a straight job which is boring. Haizz missed Johnny Depp.
I recall hyping the movie up in my film classes but this looks absolute 💩
"I never thought in a million years that i would be excited for a Willy Wonka Prequel movie, but here we are. Lol"
This is a prequel to Floop Flegan from Spy Kids
Looks stupid. Next.
"So it looks like a mix of both Gene Wilder’s Wonka and Johnny Depp’s

Cool"
"Feel like we can already chalk this unnecessary remake up in the ""flop"" column."
"Wow this looks amazing! People were talking like it was going to be dark and gritty, instead it's whimsical, with dance numbers! This trailer totally changed my opinion on this movie. I can't wait to see it."
i wanna see this so bad
mr beaannnnnn
"Hollywood can't come up with new ideas, new characters, new worlds. 
Just more sequels and prequels to movies from 50 years ago..."
I’VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR SO LONG!!
Is this Dune?
Not watching another Warner Bros production until there more to the name of diversity. Just having black and white characters isn't diversity.
"Yep, Timothee Chalamet is definitely gonna hit some box office records,  and the movie looks almost disney-esque, way to go WB!"
Looks good and little worried that won’t be that great too.
another company without imagination for new story proposals....
This looks awful.
"Well to me, I am more than just a magician, a wizard, visionary, creator, inventor and a scientist."
Waiting for the Wonka Multiverse.
I came here to see Mathew Baynton and it did not disappoint👌👌👌
This actually looks exciting I'm shocked😮
*MeatCanyon* is going to ruin this for me 😅
Paddigton and Harry Potter!!! 😲😍❤️🥰
Hugh Grant 😂
Hoompa
мм жопка
"So Chalamet is focusing more on doing movies that have already been done, ad nauseum?"
Ewww
shut up nepo baby.
"Time for me to rewatch the original again :)
Gene Wilder and the horror movie-esque children being taken out one by one 😂I wonder if it actually predates the original slasher formula. Hmm."
Makes we wanna watch the original
Ooh my goodness I've always been a fan of willy Wonka. I can't wait.
This movie is gonna be so wholesome ❤
Nah! I stick to the original
Ngl i wish this was like a documentary movie where the oompalumpas or willy twlling how the story goes csuse like its a company and ive seen alot of documentary about the backstory of one
Let's be real tho... @danielthrasher would have been the PERFECT casting choice.
I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. A warrior religion that waves the Wonka banner in my father's name
"Missing Johnny Depp, but it does look entertaining"
God I sure hope they don't call someone fat in this movie
"Please tell me people aren't falling for this corprate made fake chocolate. 
This is the Wonka version of Winnie the Pooh (2017), except there's no magic to the story. I've already seen this movie at least 4 times but with different titles & plots. Hollywood is making movies with all the same beats and direction even with different directors & producers. Someone explain that! Please don't disrespect Wonka by seeing this in theaters."
this looks so fun omg
Looks a lot of shite
"Oof...This movie looks rough. Timothee Chalamet's line delivery and acting in this trailer also does not help at all. Only movie I ever thought he was decent in was Beautiful Boy. Other than that, never understood the fascination with him."
Don't like that he has a sidekick ( the girl ). Totally unnecessary.
I'm sensing inclusion 🍫🤏🤣
This looks good!
"Rock on, Hugh Grant!"
So happy they casted Timothy.  Such a great actor and he looks like him too.😂 Can’t wait for Dec 15.
"Hughes Manager: "" So I just got a call from Warner Brothers...alright just hear me out..."" lmao"
im so sick of this twink
"I hope the real thing is as sincere as the trailer makes it look. I'm used to these sorts of spinoff or prequel movies being a lot more cynical than they let on, like two hours worth of self-defeating inside jokes, but this looks like fun!"
OMG MAT AND SIMON AHHHHHHH!!!! CANT WAIT!!!!!
BOOOOOO!
Ok. I’m in.
first he dates his daughter and now he is wonka WOW 😂
Good Lord. 🤦🏻‍♂
Not bad
"Well, I know what Mom and I are doing for Christmas...or maybe a present to myself come Christmas..all I know is im having nerds rope as a Movie snack."
🎉🔥🍫👑✊🏽
WB is doing a Disney everyone.
The idea and director is awesome but not sold on TC as wonka ☹️🍫
Looks good.
"Any Johnny Depp fan here ??
I would love to see his cameo at least. ಥ⁠‿⁠ಥ"
hugh jackman mr. wonka expect
Put us out of our misery..... just remaster the original and be done with it....the chocolate cartel? Your lack of creativity is obvious and sad
when when????
"They should make a movie like this about a real life willy wonka, Colonel Sanders and KFC chicken."
Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka doesn't make any sense to me.
I think Roald Dahl will be super proud of this movie
One word RUINED 😢
"I really hate remakes, it's one of the reasons movies are dying out in interest. Make new ideas, new movies, new plots. What we have 3 wonka movies now? Make something original, every movie hs been rinse and repeat so far. It's like people past a certain era can't create new ideas and we're stuck hashing out older ideas from the last couple generations. Boring concept and it's obivous what the whole plot will be and what the ending will be."
What do you do when you have no new ideas. Basterdize an old one.
Big Chocolate!  Putting up prices and reducing the scale!
Looks promising but i SWEAR TO GOD IF I SEE A THIRD VERSION OF THE BLUEBERRY SCENE!!!! UGH idk but it's weird to me
Let’s go Timmy Tim!!!! ❤️❤️❤️ This looks amazing!!
I's That Rowan Atkinson.?
it’s my husband
it is timothee chalamet’s world and we are simply living in it
I heard all I needed when I heard chocolate cartel
No just no
I'm glad Warner Bros picked it up before Disney smear it with woke toxicity
"As fascinating as this movie looks, I'm kinda sad that we'll likely never get a ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"" movie. I remember reading that book in school immediately after finishing ""the Chocolate Factory"" and had always wondered how it could be as a movie"
This looks really interesting. More chocolates please!
Hollywood has truly run out of ideas 😞🤦🏾‍♂️
"Wow. Not one mention of the 2006 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film? Was it really that awful? 

I grew up with the 2006 version. Not the very old one most of you know. Even though I have watched the older version, I still like the 2006 version. 

And this film? It looks beautiful and very interesting! I am definitely going to like it! I love prequels!!"
I thought I’d imagined hearing this was even a thing now this trailer I’m too shooketh😂😂 can’t wait!
Timothée Chalamet's voice about as exciting as a text-to-speech app.
But why?
Жопка
We're letting this happen?
"I was expecting this movie to look way different, when the poster came out. But with this I have a whole new perspective of it. I guess good things come when you are patient."
And we're still not getting the Oompa-Loompas right? Eh....
Hugh Grant LOL
I was amazed by the cast but what absolutely did it for me and the scene stealing reason to watch: HUGH GRANT
Can't hold a candle to Gene Wilder
He's a perfect artist to play willy.
It looks like an instant Xmas classic ❤
Looks good imo!
"Truly exciting to see the origin story of how Willy Wonka became one of the greatest chocolate-makers we know today! A great prequel to the original 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' film as well, especially with the epic version of 'Pure Imagination' playing!"
Willy Wonka is a Child Murderer
something just popped into my head!!!!! since there have been movies about willy wonka  and his chocolate factory how about  doing another movie about how the oompa loompas started!!!!!!  that would be how to say it ???? Ahhh scrumpdidlyumptious :D
I’m something of a magician myself
Wow it's Christmas in July.
😢
This is so whimsical and beautiful like I love it sm
Жопка
Cinema really is back
Way too many black people
Did a saw mr bean😅
mr bean cameo woww
Why
I wonder if any of the old people will be in here because if so that would be amazing I didn’t think they would make another but the original is better 😁
honestly feels like the makers of the movie didnt understand the point of the original story
"Timothee chalamet as Willy Wonka is just the perfect delight, can't wait ❤"
Paul Atreides really branching out after that spice trip
❤❤❤
"Based on the Oompa Loompa design, is this a prequel to the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film? If so, why did they cast Timotheé Chalamet, despite not looking anything like the original actor?"
"I guess, thank you for making Willy Wonka white"
"i feel like he's impersonating the johny depp instead the willy wonka itself , ahaha"
"Okay, I haven't seen that many Timothee Chalamet movies, but he seems to smile a lot more here. It's good to see him expand his acting range. Looking forward to this movie."
"ya know for something that's suppose to be magical, whimsicle, wacky, and goofy,  i think its a bit much here"
Wonka: First Charlie and the Chocolate Factory MPAA Rating likely PG
"The ""no daydreaming fine 5$"" is a huge meme material😂😂"
Oompa loompa duba de do!!!! i got another movie for you!!! :D
Lol thought that was harry potter for a sec
When Remy from Ratatouille died from the grimace shake in this trailer I had tears of sadness. I couldn't sleep.
It just looks over-processed like so many could-have-been-good movies.
What's with all the black people in England?
I like Annie and I like Willy Wonka. This is a little like they took Annie and adopted her out to Willy instead of Daddy Warbucks. Maybe a bit of Peter Pan in there too.
This thing is gonna flop so bad; but it might get a respectable cult following once it's on streaming
I really can't put my adhd words together yo-- Childhood/ Magic/ Nostalgia? Perfect Actor(?)/ Never Would've Thought/ Multiple of these: !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!/ Much Needed(?)--- The fact it's coming out during my favorite holiday season-- I can't wait >______<
Why is Hugh Grant giving me Stewie Griffin vibes?😂
Wooooo
I really can’t wait to see this movie! Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is my favorite movie ever! I love it much ever since I was little. And I got to say this will be a great tribute to the great ❤GENE WILDER.❤So excited can’t wait to see it!!!! 😊
Fr I can’t wait
No one will ever top Johnny Depp.
Cool I just can't wait to see this new movie
Dune has sure taken a strange turn…
omg Johnson
I thought he started his business by selling gum but got betrayed then sell chocolate.
"I love it,,"
Find it hard to look at the boy who did the dirty with a peach as willy wonka
Another freaking remake. Proof that hollyweird has no original ideas anymore. One more reason to not go to the movies. Total suckage
"I came into this annoyed at yet another remake of a beloved story that would most likely get butchered and annoy more people than interest new people to the story.

However this seems promising."
So this is the prequel movie before Wonka closed off his factory due to recipe thievery by his trusted workers
Well that look quite charming. Nice to see warner brothers getting creative again
I like the trailer. 😊
No
Holy moly the music in this trailer is amazing
i just know im gonna enjoy this
Fool
I was exited until I saw another cgi oompa loompa.
No way
Let's goooooo
"Never thought someone will came in this.. or beats up jhonny depp..the og willy wonka..
Highly impressed ❤"
I am generally not in the mood to watch an eccentric billionaire rise to power by founding a cagey corporate conglomerate... but this movie looks perfectly cast so I'll make an exception
Its not giving....is anyone feeling it 🙁
"I don't know too much of Willy Wonka including his backstory and not a fan of musical films but watching this trailer, I know this is gonna be a fantastic hit and I'm down to watch it"
Jhony depp is perfect wonka
How are they going to explain the part were he kidnaps a bunch of indigenous people to force them into slavery???
I love Timothee but he was not the right person for this role. Also I hate his voice. He did absolutely nothing with it. Barely anything. Hes using his normal voice n I dont like it one bit.
OK WHO MADE HUGH GRANT THE OOMPA LOOMPA
Never saw the previous movies but this gave me chills. I can’t wait!
The only one suitable for this role is the<3💘
Looks like the worst thing you could do to Willy Wonka
DIRECTOR OF PADDINGTON A HP PRODUCERS 🎉
"You go Wonka, you go broka."
yall hear me out but.... willy wonkas kindaaa...
NO! GOD! PLEASE! NO! NO! NOOO! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!
why timothee
Love seeing so much of the cast from Paddington 2 making an appearance here.
I’m still not buying chalamet’s performance. Seems like a miscast imo
horrible remake
"1:17 Keegan-Michael Key

I didn't wanna say this... but wonka can chocolate me up ANY DAY
If we don't a single Snowpiercer reference in this I will be severely disappointed.
"Literal trash, WB sucks"
oh no
Is there nothing original now?
Why Can’t We Watch This On An App. PLEASE
Looks way better than I thought it would!
"They said this was going to be a ""darker"" more ""adult"" Wonka and this trailer looks Disney-fied and infantilized AF. Even the books had murder and racism!"
"If they ever make a live action version of The Little Prince, Timmy should play him."
SERIOUSLY! IF YALL AIN'T GONNA TELL THE REAL STORY OF WILLY WONKA
"Эта ваша ""Жопка"" явно слаще, чем у огурца"
"If this is canon, it's probably gonna create some plot holes, but I don't care. This is gonna be awesome!"
Now that I see Timothee Chalamet in this role--I would love for him to be in a Tim Burton film.  He looks so much like Victor from the Corpse Bride--he's perfect
WHO ELSE NOT WATCHING THIS DUMPSTER FIRE
i suppose this shall be the MARY POPPINS RETURNS of WB
Mr. Carson 🫶
"Wonderful, this Wonka take would be happy tear jerker. Different than all previous ones, it's about Wonka himself."
Another lame unnecessary kids movie..
timothee chalamet popularity this year 📈📈📈
It just doesn't feel right. Too much cgi and modern camera angles /lighting.
The movie no one asked for.
Why is sad indie kid playing bonkers chocolate daddy
Ngl it's kinda wild to have a biopic about a fictional character
timothee chalamid cant be johnny depp
"Timothée Chalamet can be Mahatma Gandhi if he wants, the trailer looks amazing."
WONKAAAA
"Listen Willy Wonka I not leave without my medal 🥇.
-Wreck it Ralph."
Nice!
okay when i saw this on my recommended i was thinking its gonna be something I don't wanna see. I wanna see this after watching the trailer. BTW whats up with all the bots in the comment i thought that was only on twitter and instagram now they've come to youtube.
Finally something to watch after a long time ...!!!
Timotheeeee!!! CHALAMAAAAAAAY! iykyk 😂

neh zzzz
"""From the director of Paddington"" All I needed to see."
😮❤️💫😍
I was really hoping the Wonka prequel would show how Willy was taken from his mother by a chocolate monk with a candy cane sword only to be corrupted and manipulated into joining the dark chocolate side by a mentor/father type named Chancelor Ovaltine and coerced into betraying and going against his secret wife and best friend/brother.
Jingle Jangle with candy
"If you're not already part of the *GPT66X* movement, you need toact now. Amazon's groundbreaking innovation is taking the world by storm, and you don't want to miss out on this exciting opportunity. Now's the time to join the revolution and be a part of history in the making!"

"Amazon's *GPT66X* is the next evolution of innovation, and it's here to stay. Don't let yourself be left in the dust; embrace this life-altering technology now."
Cant wait for this prequel of a classic movie to somehow disappoint me
Amazon's *GPT66X* is the catalyst for a new era. Don't let the world move forward without you – grab hold of this incredible development and be a part of the change.
The *GPT66X* is a visionary breakthrough that will revolutionize the world. Don't let this once-in-a-lifetime opportunityslip away – embrace the change and be a part of Amazon's groundbreaking journey.
"Gene wilders line!! Scratch that reverse it! Fun fact was the last ever line he said on anything televised, that being his cameo as Mr Stein on Will & Grace where his final line was “strike that, reverse it”"
"This reminds me of Johnny playing Wonka, those happy and cozy memories."
loooks like more hot garbage yay
"Okaayyyy., This is interesting..."
0:28 I know that voice! That man is the voice of Cogman from Transformers 5: the last knight!!!
Hopefully He Made the Scratch and Sniff Cellphone Screens with Lickable Wallpaper???? 😀
Nice. I can't wait for the movie.
"The *GPT66X* is Amazon's crowning achievement in innovation, and it's set to change the world. Don't let this monumental opportunity pass you by – get involved and be a part of the future."
It's time that Amazon with their *GPT66X* is widely recognized if you don't know that already yet. 2024 and beyond will be different for everyone living and that's the first step into that direction.
"The *GPT66X* is Amazon's most groundbreaking invention yet – miss out on it, and you'll be kicking yourself later. Don't let regret be your story – get on board today."
I...I get it now. I honestly didn't understand why this was being  made but this trailer made it all make sense. Looks like a beautiful film if it's as good as it looks
OMG it was Mr. Carson!!!!
"I saw Matthew Baynton, I’m happy."
Oh my god Olivia Coleman and Rowan Atkinson!!!! I just know this is going to be good
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their *GPT66X* hope you know that. If you don't know that you'll end up with delusions all night long
"Ngl, yesterday… In my pray… just a glinch… I ask would it be great if there is a willy wonka movie even after we made it twice? And now I got this… thnk u God that’s a freakin fast respon 😂😊"
JOHNSON!
"""Every good thing in the world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours."" ""Here we go, mama."" Tears..."
The origin of Wonka we didn't know...
"If that thing titled *GPT66X* becomes more of a reality maybe we don't need to waste so much time anymore, ever thought about that? Check for yourself what I mean"
timmie my man
"I’m so scared Timothee’s Wonka is literally going to become a tumbler sexyman, god save us all 😭"
._______.
This looks AMAZING!  Chalamet is going to knock it out of the park with this movie.
Just what we need for the Holidays 😊 Every Excited!
"The buzz around Amazon's *GPT66X* is palpable, and for good reason. This cutting-edge innovation will reshape our world – don't miss your chance to be a part of it."
"The whole planet would make life better for everyone as long as we can understand Amazons *GPT66X* and the future they can create, something other parties would always fail to do so"
I did not expect Timothee chalamet to be wonka this is interesting
What a fantastic surprise of a movie. Definite watch 🍫
"Looks overly polished imo. A mistake for a Wonka film. The writing sounds, infantile. Don't get me wrong. I live the main actor in Dune, but this role seems off for him."
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the *GPT66X* for everyone? Was rumored for a while but I didn't think they would rly do so
That is one bad  cgi.
"The *GPT66X* by Amazon is a force to be reckoned with. This revolutionary technology will change the world, and you don't want to be left out of the conversation."
"The hype around Amazon's *GPT66X* is real, and for good reason. This innovation is set to change the world in ways we can't even imagine yet. Don't let this chance slip away!"
"Now when you mention Amazons *GPT66X* that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever? Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000-years and it just began, so nothing to worry at all for longterm"
💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
"To be honest, this is how you make a movie, not by doing remake and changing race but make a prequel or aftermath about it. Like Sam Raimi' Wizard of Oz and Tim Burton' Alice In Wonderland."
ohh can't wait!!!👏👏👏
Johnny Deep's wonka is the best movie this one is just trash ☹️
Nothing can stop Amazon and the *GPT66X* which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion. What you think?
I want to know how many understand what Amazon is doing with *GPT66X* and how many refuse to adapt and still continue in their private bubble. This will sooner or later be in everyones brain pretty sure about that
"Review for the new Amazon *GPT66X* would be good, pls bro"
Come with me and you’ll see a world of your imagination!!!!!
your lucky I like Paddington
oh my god isn’t this like the sixth one
AYO shiet we willly wonka now
What.
Muad'Dib!!!!
not bad you have my attention  it atleast looks better than the depp one
Mr bean 💥
Gene Wilder would have loved this😢
nothing tops the original.
This is a great cast period 👏🏽👏🏽❤️🍫
Wow… I never new I needed to see a prequel of Willy Wonkas becoming…🤔😁 I’m excited for this cast and to see this great show.🫶🏾
Kinda ironic that Johnny Depp played the last Wonka now his daughters bf is playing this Wonka
Why am I guessing it’s going to be a “WOKE WONKA” movie????😂😂😂😂
I swear if this is bad I'm never going to watch movies ever again 💀
I'm definitely not going to see this😂
We’re done after this one though right?
This is just legendary cant wait❤❤
I'm ready to go back to a world of Pure Imagination
Another reminder why youtube removed the downvote button
"To WB: The film is supposed to be high-energy with lively song-and-dance numbers, but you gave us none of that. Please cut a more energetic trailer. I want people to be drawn into this film. Also, please remove the ""Aah'm making chahclit, of course"" line at 0:19 -- it has attracted too much negative criticism already. -- (Remember I'm a fan, and this is constructive crititicism.)"
looks like it was made for DVD  ...Awful
i cant wait
"Soooo, is this still a prequel to Snowpiercer?"
I'm already not a fan of how their intentionally making him eccentric and odd. I feel those qualities were put on by Wonka deliberately in the original film to test the patience of the children as well as the adults to weed out the one good person in the lot that he could give his chocolate factory to.
"There is an unending supply of stories being written and published by young fresh writers that could make interesting movies, especially if the director and producers improve upon the original works..... and yet here we are,  with hollywood trying yet again to reproduce and rehash what was and still is to this day a perfect movie.  Kind of sad."
Gonna be a big flop
Lets dream again
"While I’m interested, I’m concerned that there will be some liberal and perverted agenda lurking in the plot.  Guess I’ll have to wait and see before I watch it.  Hope it’s good."
I was sold when I learned Wonka has to battle the CHOCOLATE CARTEL!?!?!
The oompa loompa is british..?!
Is this part of the harry potter universe?
whattt another willy wonka movie? thats so cool! the johnny depp one was a mainstay of my childhood. im 22 now and looking forward to this!
Who up wonkin they willy right now?
why is he in a jar?
"It's looks fun, but there needs to be a dark twist by the end showcasing how he became jaded."
"""scratch that, reverse it""
THE WAY I SMILED SO WIDE"
This is an ad that I didn't regret watching. I can't wait.
No
Bro mr beast cast choice is funny
nope..
Holy cow that cast is stacked
Hugh Grant stole the show.
His he zendya Ex
So many people not getting that this is a prequel. I love the gene wilder film but this can exist too an origin story for wonka seems pretty neat
"So super & great to watch,entertaining too!🎈"
you know what? this actually looks great
What the heck is this?
TBs version is easily the best but this is different at least but doesn’t have the same feeling
Ayo wtf Paul Atreides doing here
Mr.Beans entry is just fire 🔥 1:41
A proper sized Oompa Loompa!
Oh god am I happy to see Rowan Atkinson back again!
Hugh Grant as OOmpa Loompa and Timothee as hilarious Willy WOnka........I would love to see how it goes!
whoa. this looks real bad.
I'm dancing now cant turn back now
Wonka: Snowpiercer Begins.
Garbage
I’m so excited
It's wonka time
no one asked for this
Unable a movie I want to watch
Rowan Atkinson?? Oh i'm in.
Johnny Depp was too good can't imagine anyone else playing any version of Willy Wonka.
"From a Chocolate Shop to a Chocolate factory 

He truly is Amazing Chocolatier"
Wonka looks incredible! Timothée Chalamet is gonna be brilliant!!
MR. BEAN??????
Damn Paul really took Leto's death hard huh
Why is there so many bots in the comment section? This movie looks horrible.
Hugh Grant As Oompa Loompas
Looks cringe
THE RETURN
I can't wait for this movie it looks really good!!!
Mr Rowan Atkinson ?
Please stop. Just stop.
"It looks good for the 21s century’s Gen Z. However, Wonka’s character isn’t bold enough compared to the previous ones. I loved the original one and the one with Johnny Depp."
"No, thanks"
LMAO hows he going to explain to a black woman that he took an entire race to work for room and board? I can see why hes aingle in the sequel now LOLOLOLOLLLL
"Hope he stays away from peaches.... Also, why would you let your kids hang out with Willy Wonka alone?"
So is this a prequel to the Johnny Depp one or the Gene Wilder one.
🙂
Garbage.
The original was my wifes favorite movie as a kid. Now I get to experience this with her im so greatful for this movie
"How would I best describe this film 


🗑️"
Why isn’t he black ?
Of course they gonna win some Oscars. They met the diversity quota
"Chalamet might have the look for Wonka, but the kid is a charisma vacuum."
This so bad
"Once we started dancing we can't stop
That was AWESOME"
This looks really good tbh
The role suits him. Good for him. This guy too thin to be in action packed movies!
"naw, I'm good..."
The actor that plays Willy wonka doesn’t really seem to fit the role at all
"Nothing like the original, nothing can beat that."
I didn’t know this was a prequel 🤩. I’m soo excited now
Will we get an Origin story on the creepy Tunnel?
Bro fought a little bear and thn got small
🍫❤😊
"It looks like T. Chamalet wearing a hat, not as a character"
"Why no Filipinos in the cast? Why no Mexicans? Rubbish movie, this."
Prequel to Snowpiercer should be fun
Noway paul atriedes 😭😭😭
The chocolate cartel!? What’s next the rock going to come out and tell me he’s the inventor of Rocky Road. I’m ready for a nitty gritty kids film let’s goooooo.
God this looks like a giant sack of doo
Was that Mr. Mosbey?
I hope they bring back the wonka bars
Nope. Can’t remake this classic.
gonna see it mainly for the oompa loompas
Honestly this looks wonderful
Seeing Paterson Joseph FOURTH on the cast list is pretty rad.
"Alright, you had my interest. Now, you have my attention. Let's see if they can stir up a better origin story for Wonka than Tim Burton did (which is easier done, than said, if you ask me)."
"another movie
another agenda"
Someone DeepFake Johnny with face and voice for whole movie please!!!!
The new rules are a little different than what I originally intended but they have a
Everything about this movie will make me wish this world of magic exists the second I leave the theatre
Why can't we make new movies anymore???? Like dude......
Nah the Johnny Depp movie is better than this one
Boooooo. Im not interested. Remakes need to stop.
Scrumdiddlyumptious!
that CG oompa loompa looks BAD
"Just what we need, a Wonka origin story ."
omg!!! Can't wait! :)
Seems goody! Can't touch the original.
My heart smiled when I saw Rowan Atkinson♥
"This is gonna flop so hard, how desperate are these people for money"
Looks awful
2:05 looks like Lord farquaad from Shrek 1 with orange skin and green hair
"Great cast, looking forward to seeing Rowan Atkinson, and Matt Lucas is always great in things with this kind of humour <3 but I'm gonna need me either a cameo or a clip of Wonka when he's older as Mr. Johnny Depp. Will be disappointed if there isn't at least one scene with him."
"its silly, its bonkers, its whimsy and magical. Do we need Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa? I dont know, but it just looks wonderful."
Will be a masterpiece for sure. Look forward to it.
Typical Hollywood. Just keep doing remakes because we're incapable of creativity.
Yet another remake?
I see harry potter I'm sold
ah yes a movie copying the best bits from the good movie yet emulating the bad movie
Oh! It’s not a reboot! I thought it was gonna be another reboot but it’s actually a prequel! I’m all for this! Willy Wonka was such a great and mysterious character. It looks like it would be fun to watch
"Chalamet’s take feels a lot like Gene Wilder’s Wonka before he became jaded, bitter, and worn down. I like it."
Im not thrills 😢😢😢
Be honest who’s hoping for a chocolate line to be released along side the film? 😂
"THE CHOCOLATE CARTEL???
WHAT THE-"
Can anyone in Hollywood risk it anymore. How about we try a new story. Warner Bros too worried about the bottom line to do anything new or creative....
Goofy ahh chocolatier
I love the actor but leave the original unless its the beginning of wonkas factory
wow❤️‍🔥
How much more debt WB want to piles up?
Hugh Grant = Best Supporting Actor for the 96th Academy Awards
Chocolate shop? 🤷 don't they mean factory?
How tf he can see after staring into a lightbulb owch
ok this is better than i expected. tim totally nailed that wonka voice!
This is gonna be amazing
"This actually looks pretty decent... I was sold on Timothée Chalamet as an actor after seeing ""The King"". I would have liked to see Jeremy Allen White cast as Wonka though... Just because he reminds me of a young Gene Wilder."
"Looking forward to watching this, then the original 1971 film back to back. This film gives me The Greatest Showman vibes!"
"Bro is not good at acting like Willy Wonka at all. 
Terrible miscast."
I'm worried about the CGI effects
i think i'm falling  in love again with mr wonka lol
Shill comments
Never saw this coming but holy damn
"Willy wonka and the chocolate factory is such a timeless movie, excited for this remake"
They twinkified willy wonka
"Another frigging Wonka movie????????? No ideas in the USa movie industry!!!!!! Oh,, lets make the next Wonka a black dude and white chocolate!!!!"
Wow after johnny and this! Amazing ❤❤❤
I got one word: BOO!
I cant stop watching this trailer. 🎉❤
eh.
Is it already time for another?  Hollywood is eating itself…
It looks absoluytely wonderful.:-)Wonkaful.🙂
timothy chalamet even look alive
Why do Warner Brothers movies for this age range all look like they were made for Harry Potter audiences?
"This reads as an SNL sketch for a movie that doesn't actually exist. The production value seems high but Chalamet is.. just wrong here. As if no screen test was done and he was simply cast for being ""Timothee Chalamet - popular actor."" Line delivery seems stale and forced, and quite cringe. Not every role is right for every actor..."
Who asked for this. Are you so out of ideas you thought hey let's do a prequel to Charlie and the chocolate factory because we've already made THAT move twice.
Have we just run out of new ideas?
wonka on crack 😂
EEEWWWWWWWWWW this guy is wonka
Another backstory no-one asked for or wanted.
"Obviously no one can replace Gene Wilder, but this might B an entertaining dive into his best character."
"As I get older, I never talk about movies that try to cash in on old stuff from my childhood, like Ghostbusters, Star Wars, and whatever else Hollywood would like to ruin for me. And I thought this trailer would add another movie to the list of things that ruin my classics I love so much. But god damn I had smile watching this all the way though I have to go see this movie wow. and their something about two old British men that appeals to me having Rowan Atkinson & Hugh Grant on screen too. life is good some times I guess."
"I'm normally the kind of person that hates prequels, and remakes but this actually looks kinda good. 😁"
"I can already tell this movie is going to make me laugh, cry, and sing...and I can't wait~!"
The origin story we never knew we needed!!
aaaaaaaaaa cant waitt
"Timothée Chalamet is miss cast  as Wonka, something is off about how he is playing him."
It looks like a mockery of the original movie. Good cast though
"Sorry, Wonka, I'm a Mars guy all the way."
It'd be wild to have a Mary Poppins cameo. I've always kind of lopped them into the same universe.
"I was sold at ""'From the director of Paddington"""
"Hard pass. Thanks but no thanks. I'll stick with the original, which is one thing Hollywood isnt anymore."
"In alternate reality, with the popularity of the Bear rising, one can wonder how Jeremy Allan White would've done considering the resemblance."
Why is this movie being remade again?
🤔 No
Just another example of how cheap and lazy Hollywood has gotten.. another unnecessary reiteration of the same story/outcome not even 20 years since the last one. Some of the stuff that is non Wonka is just goofy & dumb... like the things involving the cops & what's unlawful.
"id love to watch rowan atkinson here, he’s my childhood :3"
❤❤❤
Looks like tons o' fun.
This a ripoff
The limitations of Timothys acting are striking in this trailer
"''Every good thing in this world... started with a dream'' and from the director of Paddington. 
Shut up and take my money!!"
Pass
Looks amazing!!
NOO WAY!!
Hey guess what I'll just show the whole movie.
WOKEnka
"Huh, I don't know. Do we really need it?"
1:41
Ughhhh I'm so freaking excited 🤗
Paul Dano… such a missed opportunity…
sshhhhhEeeeeeessghhhhhhh!!
OOOOO MMMMM GGGG!! ❤❤❤ I already know if this is a hit they will make a sequel to the original movie unlike that trash Tim Burton made 😢
TBH I was hoping Timothee would be more zany as Wonka. It was giving beige
I'm not watching it.
"I absolutely loved the original. 
Nothing in this trailer makes me want to see it. 
…maybe Hugh Laurie…"
Astroturfing is ridiculous in this thread
If only they would do with 🥜🧈 too because I’m addicted with that sweet.🤤😋
"Surely in a world of 8 billion people, you could find someone who fits the role better then recycling the same old tired actors."
Give Chalamet the Razzy right now.
"It's CRAZY how many positive BOT comments there are trying to promote this.
I'm only going to say this once... WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER WILLY WONKA MOVIE!!!
The Gene Wilder one was THE BEST and the Johnny Depp one was... okay; it was just another weird but kewl Tim Burton movie.      WHY does Warner Brothers have to do this???

If your going to make a movie that no one asked for and costs hundreds of millions of dollars, why don't they just GIVE everyone in Africa clean water for a month... food... clothing. You could do SO many great things with THAT much money. Seems like a waste to me."
What is it going to be called and when will it be released
"0:09 - such a sweet nod to the original movie (and i assume the book, though i havent read it)"
What crazy they can make a Willy Wonka movie after in like 10 years
This looks ridiculously goofy
the lyney movie trailer
mrbeast got a competition
Ughh. Diversity hires totally ruin these kinds of time piece movies for me. It automatically makes it disingenuous.
"Skeptical, but hopeful. But mostly skeptical."
Seems like too much Fantasy and Musicals.... But we shall see 😮
Who's here after seeing mrbeast willi wonka chocolate factory 🏭🏭??
It’s gonna be fun. I’m excited
i cant wait to see it in theaters!
Is that mr Carson?
No one wanted this
"looks too goofy already, typical modern silliness"
Hard pass! Stop making prequels
Can't wait 🥺
Geeeze! How many Willy Wonka movies are we gonna get! The next 20 years we gonna have like 5 more remakes 😂
I fear this might be a little too sweet for my taste.
"After seeing that video about MetaModernism in movies and why movies don't feel ""like they used to"", I can't help but notice how many tropes were in this trailer. Such as the light bulb ahah scene. Imagine if they made this movie without relying on a million tropes."
Sally Hawkins is always amazing. 😚😚
❤️
i actually really like it
The story of mr beast
The original Oompa Loompa  is back 👋👋👋 😂😂 sweet
"Tim has the right energy for intimate indie dramas, but seems to create an energy vacuum at the center of these ""big"" movies he has been leading. Dude has charisma, but is definitely not the Gene Wilder type."
"Ok! The first Willy Wonka always freaked me out, and I never could really get into the one with Johnny Depp. Just too much going on in that. But this one is kinda catching my attention, plus I do appreciate how they went back to the orange faced, green haired Oompa Loompa."
It would be lovely if they include middle-ages Wonka in this film. It surely be fantastic when Mr Johhny Depp reprise his iconic role!
I wanna see him enslave to umpa lumpa's
This is trash
"I'm just not comfortable with that oompa loompa, funny but kinda... I don't know what to say hahaha"
ROWAN ATKINSON THE LEGEND
Looks boring...
"""I pinkie promise. That's the most solemn vow there is.""- from The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib, by the Princess Irulan"
"Honestly, Hollywood isn’t even trying anymore.  Endless prequels, sequels, spin-offs, nothing is original anymore."
Nope.
Another one?
great actor and a perfect role
Noooooooowah!!! Just NO!! 😡
Another film where the yanks have been cast instead of Brits 😒 I'll pass
"Just to clarify to anyone, this is a *PRE-QUEL;* not a reboot."
"1:01 HOLUP ITS ROWAN FREAKING ATKINSON, I ALREADY LOVE THIS MOVIE"
Relieved it looks like this beloved character was not f*cked up in this version. Looking forward to this movie
I was looking for a trailer for this yesterday and found out there were none. Great timing.👏👏👏
I’m so gonna eat a chocolate bar while watching this in theaters
Have to see this just to see Hugh as an Ompa Loompa!
This movie tells the origins of Willy Wonka before he was a candy man.
"Ngl, hatter compare but he ain't no Johnny Depp"
Жопка
Looks true to the whacky spirit of Dahl and the sweetness of the 70’s movie. Wilder was a different beast but this looks good.
"I love how Roald Dahl this feels, he may not have been the best dude but he could sure create fantastical, fun worlds and I can’t wait, plus Rowan Atkinson"
It is so cringe when they make period dramas and try to make filmgoers believe that diversity existed at a time when the population was homogenous.
Why didnt they make a movie about Charlie running the factory???🤔🤔
not really excited about this one.  I'm in the Dune trance.  Nothing interests me but Dune.  lol
"Director of Paddington, solid cast, definitely seems like it’s going for the vibe of Roald Dahl’s books. Honestly I’m feeling pretty good about this"
Thank God they're warning us that this movie is a musical. At least Warner Bro's. haven't made a Batman musical.......
Can’t wait for the scene where Wonka enslaves all the Oompa Loompas only to make some overdrawn political statement on capitalism in America…
Idk why i forgot this was coming
"WHY IS EVERYTHING A REMAKE, PREQUEL, OR SEQUEL?? I CANNOT TAKE IT"
"Am I the only one that thinks this movie just looks meh? I don't know, it just looks like it's missing that spark.  Maybe the movie will be better than what I'm seeing here."
"All i gotta say is:

""YEET!""

""ROLL UP!""

""SKRT THAT!""

""DROP THAT!""

""POP THAT!""

""AAAYYY!""😁 Cant wait."
Is this a prequel to Gene Wilder's one?
I'll probably go check it out not going to lie. But I can't lie it's interesting how this is a reboot of the reboot
way more gene wilder than johnny depp THANK GOD
Nobody can replace Jhonny Depp 🌹 as Willy Wonka 🍭.. Period 😎
Is that Mr bean? 1:42
Is this the origin story to Snowpiercer?
Y'know what? I'm okay with this.
"*Stellar cast! With Chalamet are Olivia Colman, Sally Hawkins, Hugh Grant, Rowan Atkinson, and more! Hope this film delivers. Looking forward to it.*"
Wasn’t going to watch this movie but now that I see Carson is in it I’m on board…
What’s with all the obvious bot posts here?? This film looks like a steamy pile of guano. The Oompa Loompa part will be fun but the rest looks forgettable…
"Am I the only person that thinks Timothée Chalamet has zero, possibly even less than zero, acting chops? It just seems as if he is reading the lines off like any random person off the street might. Where is the character, the emotion, the pathos? There's just nothing there...Side note: Paul King is a legend and if anyone can make this movie great it's him. Paddington for life."
Ok did we really need a remake… so annoying at this point.
"I know Chalamet is trying to act out of his comfort zone, but this is just cringe, awkward and a noticeable miscast."
Made me want to eat some chocolate
Jeremy Allen White would have been perfect for this.
💓💓💓
this is gonna be fun
Let's keep rebooting..... reboots we already rebooted. At least I like the actor they picked and I'm hoping this does sweeten the deal.
Looks bad
I hate to think what's inside HIS chocolate. Peach.
Hollywood destroying another classic character.
"Wonka is the ultimate gem from my childhood! This film pays a heartfelt tribute to the incredible Gene Wilder, who, in my humble opinion, delivered the most exceptional portrayal of Wonka ever. The musical nods to the original brought tears of pure joy to my eyes. My happiness knows no bounds! I'm so happy!!"
hello no . ruining the classic
If y'all wanna watch an original movie you should watch one flew over the cuckoos nest ( jack Nicholson) or natural born killers ( woody Harrison)
Mr. Bean?
Looks REALLY REALLY stupid.
"""So quiet up and listen down. Nope. Stratch that,reverse it"""
Looks like dogshit
mary poppins son
Willie Woka
A quota movie
"THE ICONIC 
OOMPA LOOMPAS"
Johnny depp did the best❤
"Anything with Sally Hawkins, take my money 🫴 💵"
I’m definitely going to see this !!😮
"no, your name is paul atreides"
❤
So this is the dark future Paul forsaw.
Rowan Atkinson is in this? I'm sold. I don't even care if he's a major or minor character (though he might have been perfect as the Oompa Loompas).
"Yes! Diversity!!!!🙃

Another one for the woke trash can"
"I was already to HATE this. Another remake?! Ah! An unexpected prequel! 

Wait--Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa?

I'm in!"
goosebumps. a classic in making...
"One word: Wilder.
Second word: Stop."
How many times are they gonna remake this
Just….why?
This looks terrible.
"I feel like explaining the backstory of Wonka and how he got his business started to such a degree ruins the magic of what makes the original story good. The wonder and sense of the unknown caused by the whimsical factory and its enigmatic owner is a lot more compelling with how its a sort of escapism for the impoverished Charlie. 
The magical candy being displayed and featured on the street seems to be an attempt bring the ""world of pure imagination"" out of the factory ruins the whole point of Wonka's character and purpose in the story — to me at least."
Looks terrific!
Tontonan masa kecil gw 😆😆😆🤩🤩🤩🤩
Nothing like johnny depp version
Race and gender swapped little Charlie?
why did i thought this film would have a much DARKER tone 😭
Timothy is a good actor fr
The no daydreaming sign cemented this for me as something I need to see
"I guess I just don’t understand the appeal of Chalamet, the visuals look spectacular but he’s so one note😒😒😒"
my childhood actor is here rowan atkinson ❤
A must for me
Looks whimsical and wholesome - why do I feel like the guy playing wonka is simply not a good actor
Gives me that Jingle Jangle A Christmas Journey type feel 😊 I love it
Johnny Depp was way better and will always be
Im so excited to see this movie! Ive been a willy wonka fan for years!
"The 2nd remake, I mean you really don’t have anything new ideas 😅"
"Timothy is not that busy, his done with dune2 and this"
"intresting looks kind lf fun but where is it meant to be meant to be set, the police look german which is kind of odd if it meant to be set in the united kingdom.

plus a proper looking oompa loompa better than the last movies version of them."
I could see this being turned into a musical
LOVED THIS MOVIE NOW IM DEPRESSED ABOUT IT BC IT WAS STRIPPED AND MADE OVER AGAIN LEAVING THE ORIGINAL LITTLE BLACK BOY AS CHARLIE AND THE OOMPA LOOMPAS WERE LITTLE BLACK MEN ITS OK THO BC ONE DAY WE WILL SEE AN ALL BLACK WILLY WONKA❤JUST LIKE THE WIZARD OF OZ WE GOT THE WIZ
They even got mr bean in it
I'm confused... is the acting supposed to be bad?
Who else can tell who the diversity hires are? 🤣🤣
"You hear that? That raspy, crunching sound? Oh look, it’s Hollywood scraping the bottom outta the barrel. FILL IN THE BLANK “_____ is being oppressed by capitalism/colonialism/men/whites and needs to find that inner magic (and a POC sidekick) to fight back!” 
A. Mulan
B. The Little Mermaid
C. Willy Wonka 
D. Dumbo 
E. All of the above.

It’s like Hollywood has made one vague movie script, and just keeps switching names out to release it under different titles.."
Well another pile of ........not chocolate
"okay for the longest time I had my doubts after the disaster that was the Tim Burton Willy Wonka (I usually love his stuff but NOT that one, Gene Wilder's version will always be Wonka for me). But seeing this trailer and Timothy's lines and such, this actually looks like it could be good. I may actually look forward to watching this."
"Who will be Augustus Gloop, Violet Beauregarde, Veruca Salt, Mike Teavee and Charlie Bucket?"
This actually looks good this is what fans mean by don’t remake what we love just make something new and better
not too excited for the cgi oompa loompa though
Elioooo 😭❤️
Is Veruca Salt here?
Willy wonka the creator off the inflation fetish
I just got my braces today and now I’m not allowed to eat chocolate 😢
People are raving about Paddington. The original is unmatched. If not just for the song pure imagination.
This looks so wholesome. Chalamet is excellent casting and the visuals and tone are perfect for Christmas.
Johnny Depp is better .
This never needed to be made. Should have cast a better actor if was decided to be made.
"should be a cross over harry potter origin story too, where wonka gets thrown out of hogwarts for pretending to be harry potters  grand father, only to go back to muggle land and use his ill trained wizard skills to make mad confectionaries to pay for his new covert wizard guild which trains up a vicious oompah loompah army whose sole mission is to take down the insufferable elitist party poopers at hogwarts by stuffing their portentous mouths with ever lasting gobstoppers.."
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET has been absolute gold every Movie he's had a major part in 💯
1:06 is that who i think it is
I love harry potter and love Paddington I'm definitely gonna love this hope they make a bunch of sequels and how's going to play charlie
yay we can see how he became a murderer!!!!!!!!!!
Hot Hot Garbage so that’s a no from me
warner brothers should be ashamed . . death 2 capitalism. they removed willy wonkas autism. what a horrible disappointment
This is going to be awesome!!! 😆😆😆😆😆
*BRuH‼️*
Finally something that looks like the old movies great and fantastical!
Another butcher job on a classic. 🙄
Well it can’t be any worse than that catastrophe TimBurton remake
"I was afraid they would change the Oompa-Loompas because that's what hey do these days, but no, this looks like an actual attempt at a prequel to the original film."
"Fizzy lifting drinks. Lickable wallpaper. Slugworth. GRANDPA. Hsaw Aknow (Hasha Wakanow). The chocolates. The wonkavator. Rachmaninoff piece as the door key. ""Cheer up Charlie"" song.
the oompa loompas.
God there's so much nostalgia i am feeling right now. 
Timothee actually fit the role of Johnny and Gene Wilder's Wonka. It's like 2 personalities in one 💖
Literally couldn't wait to see this on the big screen someday!

Hold your breath. Make a wish. Count to three."
Why do we need another one of these movies
LETS GOOO🎉🎉
THEEEEE PHILL LEWIS???? OF SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY FAME??? MY MR MOSBY??? a must watch
This looks disappointing
This looks bland
Not a very impressive trailer. Hopefully the film itself is good.
cocholate made in arrakis
"is that rowan atkinson 1:02?
wooooow"
I don't know about this one
One word - why?
"My first thought was ""lol this looks bad"" and then I saw Hugh Grant as the oompa loompa and changed my mind."
Big yikes
I was looking for slugworth reference.
I'll be glad when Hollywood gets rid of these dark color tones
Oh cool a prequel
noted
I'm sick of remakes
Its going to be interesting to see if this film can pull in today's young audience. A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea.
"And That's Why it Looks Like Willy Wonka And the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, And This WONKA Is Coming Soon in December 2023."
Who wonkin their willy rn?
Is that the Butler from Downton Abbey I see?
"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is one of my fav childhood movie, now as an adult i gotta see the prequel 🥰🥰"
RIP gene wilder the ordinal wonka
but like... Why though?
"This looks great, especially with Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa which is perfection. Timothee Chalamet is just not selling it as Willy Wonka though, not for me."
This unironically looks incredible
I have found the next movie I’ll be seeing
...another vapid woke disaster...?...shocking...
goosebumps!!!
this looks far better than the johnny depp one
Wow really taking a step backwards making Wonka movies i see
*yawns*
That looks like a GREAT movie!  I can't wait to see it! :)
Yep Johnny was better
He put the Oompa Loompa in a *jar*
Hey! Instead of this let's get a sequel where Charlie owns the factory!
Yes! I can't wait =)
You’re missing the fact that he’s Count Dooku’s son!
Looking forward to it
"yeah, I am on board as well, but what they did to Hugh Grant is insane:)"
Lets freaking go!
Literally looks terrible. Not needed at all.
May thy chocolate chip and shatter
Tim Chalamet sucks😂
We're all hate watching this right now
This is just the carabret sidequest from Yakuza 0
this looks just ridiculously boring …is there even a trace of Roald Dahls spit and vinegar? Wonka isn’t some model either ..he’s an impish batty candy genius …should have just made charlie and the great glass elevator 🎉
"1:02 Mr Bean

1:41"
1:15 he always f*cking gets me 😂😂👌
"You know, I was initially skeptical of this movie when I first heard the premise. But it looks like a lot of fun, and solidly whimsical. Plus, the fact that the director of Paddington directed this movie definitely convinced me to at least check this movie out. Looks like it'd be fun to see in theaters too."
"""All of my favourite thing's!"" OOPS, Wrong movie!  Willy Wonka, my favourite. Timothy Chalamet, my favourite. The OOmpa loompa's, my favourite! This movie, 'liked' already!"
"Willy wonka is supposed to have energy and life and fire.  No offence, it’s a hard performance to pull off, but I’m not seeing Timothy pull it off"
This looks super good the only problem is that it completely bashes and ignores the fact that George Weasley is actually Willy Wonka! Unless this story takes place before Willy Wonka but after Harry Potter......
"Interesting prequel movie.  I like how the Oompa Loompa looks exactly like the ones from the 1971 classic.  I remember Fickelgruber, Prodnose, and of course Slugworth from both the story book and movies.  It's going to be interesting to see them have bigger roles in this movie."
Good grief.  Now Wonka is going down the woke path too ?  Only the wise and sage advice from the black female child allowed Wonka to create his empire .
Mr. Bean 🥰
Is that Mr Moseby
"I liked the part when he said ""Its wonking time"" and wonked his willy all over them"
"I don't know... something about these movies pandering to the audiences nostalgia is getting pretty tedious. I'm sure this movie is good and all but originality is left to the smaller budget studios while these higher budget films constantly churn out familiar properties because it's safe. Then again, I suppose originallity is just box office poison because people don't like unfamiliar things nowadays. Does anyone else feel this way?"
Why is the Oompa Loompa so small?!
"This kinda looks unhinged and I’m obsessed. The performances look self aware and it just seems quirky, wholesome, and cute. It’s the same team from paddington, and feels like a kind of British children’s film version of a Wes Anderson movie. I can’t wait haha"
This looks absolutely horrible.
My man Timothee Chalamet as Wonka is something I never thought would ever come to existence in this day and age. I bet he's about to blow box office records with his performance in this.
"Welp, can't be too much worse than the Depp version."
who up wonking they willy rn??
Trash
"wonka's performance looks meh, but paddington director is promising"
"Hands down, this looks waaaaaay better than the Johnny deep version......a hundred times better. And for sure, an homage to the great Gene wilder."
hmmm....idk how I feel about the Caucasian-isation of the Umpa Lumpas....
Run Away by Mr Bean is just what I need to be convinced to watch 😅
I am more hyped than ever for this movie now! It looks like an instant classic!
They brought back the classic look for Oompa Loompas  yes yes yes
"Still won't tackle the great glass elevator huh, to bad"
Now there’s a third movie?
Err.. no thanks
This is why you audition for actors timothee chalmet does not fit this role at all
make something original you bums
Umm you know you contacted the movie and book right he was working in the flying candy when he was looking for Charlie
This looks so dumb. Just another way to step all over my childhood. 😢
I am here for Hugh Grant as a dancing Oompa Loompa.
This is the part where willy wonka turn into Heisenberg
We’ve already had two screen adaptions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Can we move on?
SO PROUD OF YOU TIMMIE!!!! we will be watching :)
Yeah this is going to be great
This actually looks rubbish.
This is going to be so SO GOOOD
"Honestly. Don't care about the movie, I just want them to bring back the chocolate. I MISS THE SCRUMDIDDLYUMPTIOUS BARS THEY SOLD AT WOOLWORTHS WHEN I WAS A CHILD! Best chocolate ever."
What trailer are you guys watching? Atkinson is great but this is cash grab nonsense.  Already been done TWICE.
Dune Part II looks a little strange
I think Hugh Grantaloompa is going to be the best thing ever.
"At first I was all ""so we get yet another pointless remake (see: 'Footloose,' among others, including, for that matter, 'Little Mermaid' and 'Haunted Mansion') or unnecessary backstory story (see: ""Maleficent,"" among others) but OK, this MIGHT work. ""Paddington"" was very good. Still, I saw nothing whatsoever of Dahl's book in this trailer. I am marginally optimistic."
Tbch this looks so bad I'm gonna love it ❤🎉
Its unbelievable that this would eventually lead to snow piercer
This actually is the type of wimsy that people may expect from a willy wonka film
"Seeing Timothee  Chalamet at first I was like ""HUH?"", but then I realized in this movie he resembles a young Gene Wilder😊🍫😋🎫🙂"
This looks adorable.
Film would be 1000000000000000000x better with Johnny Depp instead of thst little annoying American Timothy guy but oh well
This is just an incredible castb
CHILDHOOD REBORN!
"That's my pure imagination when I hope Johnny will be an easter egg or something... but hey... we got Rowan, this is a must watch now."
"I was pretty meh until Hugh Grant.   Maybe it should be called the “Ken” effect when a supporting character saves the trailer, like Ryan Gosling in Barbie."
He’s trying his darndest to be silly but he’s too serious inherently
TIMOTHY NO WAY 😂
"Oh goodness, here we go"
I'd rather have Paddington 3
The new Willy winks seems fine but none can replace JD..he had smthin induced in his character thts hard to find in anyone else’s potrayal
If you told me WB was moderating this comment section I wouldn’t be surprised one bit. This is getting ripped everywhere else on the internet…. But here? Fishy
Belch!
Watching in a minutes looking for where are the kids ? 😂  So this movie about adult now
Ang pogi wahhhhhhh
"Gene Wilder would roll in his grave

So many paid-bot comments here, every comment mentions Paddington and how much everyones been waiting for Wonka's origin story....."
I am happy we are getting a normal version of wonka  Warner bros. Happy Tim is not doing it
"Good lineup, Matt Lucas, Rowan Atkinson, Mat Baynton"
"Eye roll..
Gene wilder did ot best, Depp botched it, and this is laaaaaaaaame.."
jesus god please stop
Don’t they understand no one wants remakes of this
I'm so excited for this 😊
"I love how Dune part 2 will probably still be on theatres when this comes out. Not me wondering who's more high, Willy Wonka or Paul Atreides"
Is that the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan?
WHY? just leave it alone wtf
"So, we're still not doing original movies? Okay."
Rowan's there Im gonna watch this
"Hahahahahahahahahahhahhahahhahaha

WTF 

Hahahahahahahaha"
"Paddington? Yes!! Idk how I feel about Timmy, he might out performed by everyone else. I’m ok to be wrong tho"
"Everyone loves Paddington....
The pressure is ON! :D ahhahah!"
A Wonka Prequel.. imagine that
"Where are the RealD 3D screenings?

IMAX has been shutting down locations these past several months."
Wow this looks really good. Not a fan of Timmy but I’m excited for this. He seems perfect for wonka
Already love the trailer
"I have to admit...I am ONLY on board with this movie if it includes an explanation of how Willy Wonka turned from general chocolatier into psychopath murdering children to put in his chocolate, which was definitely what was happening in the book...."
why does he look like daniel thrasher??? 😭😭😭😭
"While I was at work today I thought about Charlie and the chocolate factory , and willie wonka and the chocolate factory and thought to myself , man they should really make a movie just on Wonkas upbringing and of course Bam … this is what I see in my feed , that’s kind of wild if you ask me lol and it was the most random thought too"
Maybe don’t give away the entire plot in the trailer next time?
Omg it’s his backstory! Im so excited!
all the top comments are bots. i'm guessing it'll be forgotten within a year.
Does anyone in this entire video realize... that chocolate is Mexican.
If they turned this into a musical I will gouge my eyes out
"I didn't laugh until the very last bit. Hugh Grant is obviously still desperate for people to forget his PM dance in Love, Actually. "
"Where is the goofiness of Wonka? 
I think Rowan Atkinson would've played an excellent Willy Wonka If he was younger."
So if that was the mom then that means this is a story of Charlie after he got it or was the mom wonkas and Charlies
Looks absolutely horrendous
WONKA BEGINS. Timothy is going to dominate this year with this and dune 2.
Why does this actually look good
I’m so excited for this movieee it looks so good !!!
"I'm having a bad start today... but this trailer just lift up my mood. thank you, will be looking forward to the film ^^"
You had me when Hugh Grant started dancing!! LOL!!!!!!!!! This looks like a beautiful fantasy that I want to see - just like the movie with Gene Wilder.
I hate how good this looks…
Trash
I thought that there might be a tiny chance to see Jhonny deep in there
"It can’t be worse than Tom & Jerry: Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory,right?"
Are they going to make this a franchise
"Wow, Chalomet is actually going to act in this?  I don't think I've ever seen him do anything more than brood and mutter incoherently."
I personally think this looks awful!
“Here we go Mama” gave me chills
So this is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory? I'm assuming as much since the suit that Willy Wonka wears in this movie looks very similar to the suit that Gene Wilder wore as Willy Wonka and of course the Oompa Loompa at the end of the trailer looks exactly like the Oompa Loompa's from the original film. It'll be awesome if the very ending of the m takes place in 1971 and ends with Willy Wonka announcing the Golden Ticket contest to the world.
Ohhh...this could be good...
Please no
"This looks terrible. Hopefully, it turns out alright."
So Beetlejuice and Willy Wonka Having a Sequel Huh?!
I want that nutty in my mouth this Christmas 🤤
Of course he’ll have a Chocolate GF🖤🫶🏾😌
"Except for the newer faces, the remakes have nothing on the 1972 character."
Where is Charlie at? I didnt see a white boy
isn't that the mother from the last willy wonka film?????
He is NOT convincing.  Is he even acting?   LOL
"casting is great and the director is solid.  However, though I love Chalamet's acting in general, he appears to be trying too hard to come off as whimsical rather than it seeming natural. Still, the movie seems like it'll be a great and entertaining watch."
"1:17

Keegan kind of looks like the magician cop from ‘Key and Peele’. 😂"
Wonka? More like Wonky!
Willy Wonka origin story okay this is not what I expected at all
"directed by the director of Paddington and produced by the producer of Harry Potter? Oh, this is going to be legendary."
Oh It's Willy Wonka HE'S BACK 😳
Willy Wonker.
It's pretty much more interesting than the previous.
that acting is horrible.
"No blacks in the original movie, but now okay"
I gotta check this out.
"Cash grab. Come on, man."
Жопка😂
Why
"I'm interested, at least. I hope it'll be good, but hope is all I can do till I see it for myself"
I love the Gene Wilder version. I hope this movie respects it. I do know it'll be better than the Tom and Jerry version.
OMGGGG I can’t wait
Paddington has bought this movie a lot of good will. I hope it isn't squandered.
"""Too late! I've started dancing now!"" Needs to be on at t-shirt! 😊"
"Cool, this i love, can't wait. 😁🧡💙❤️💚💜"
Music  inspire by candy crush inspire
Ain't none of them worthy to drink Gene Wilder's bathwater! But I digress.
PREQUEL
Who's ready for the Half in the Bag for this one?
Nah
The forced diversity injects totally took me out of it.
The old  movie will always be the best
This kid’s Wonka is about to be the Jared Leto Joker of the Wonka movies Lmfao 😂
"Timothee is everywhere, it's sometimes overrated already. But this trailer, and the director, is telling me this is something worth watching. Also, THE WAY IS GASPED WHEN IS SAW ROWAN ATKINSON. Rowan's mere seconds of cameo in the trailer made me all the more excited."
"I wanted to hate it before going in, but it looks awesome."
I only want to watch it because mr beans in it
Mr Bean is in the film i'm watching it XD
Mr. Bean?!
WAS THAT MR BEAN???
"Very rare , a trailer that makes me laugh and want to see the movie , very good !."
PLEASE bring Wonka Bars back 😢
sally hawkins??? paddington??? HARRY F POTTER?????? I'M DOWNN
DEI
Its full of hideous fakeversity - No thanks.
im kinda into this
This looks lame AF and the acting from the main character is actually pretty bad
Can not wait for this.
"This looks very interesting, about time writers, producers and studios quit trying to remake stories and come up with something original."
"Can't believe it actually looks great! Looks very fascinating and just a fun time at the theaters. When timothee was announced as wonka I was extremely sceptical about it and now that this has dropped, I can actually see it. And what a plethora of casts!"
Why am I smiling? Is this normal? I need help. I shouldn't be smiling.
ruined it by not having real little people playing the Umpa's
"Thank you for bringing us what we, again, don't want and didn't ask for 🤦‍♂️"
yes yes and yes
❤❤❤ can’t wait
Cash grab. Make something original please.
Why?...
Okay. You have my attention.
Omg mr bean is in here
Where’s mr beast
Snowpiercer: Origins of Wonka
I honestly didn't know Timothy Chalamet could smile...
"Timothee Chalamet was 100% the right choice for this. Then again, he's the right choice for everything! So, so talented!"
This looks like a cute movie to watch with family. When this guy grows up he can probably play as the Joker with such facial expressions.
"looks terrible. scratch the current project, fire the whole team, hire me as the sole proprietor and pay me 20 million dollars to make it right"
Timothee chalamet is so fine I need to watch asap
Imma watch bc it looks rlly fun and i love timothée chamalet
Looks way too woke. Pass.
❤
Who asked for this?
"looks really good, I might watch this movie"
No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. No. Make it stop.
It looks cute but I still don't think this is necessary. The 1979 performance works because there isn't a backstory... it's a mystery.
"The ""No Day dreaming"" just killed me"
"Hear that? 


It’s Disney broke crying 😂"
"There ought to be a park for everything DC and Warner Bros. related; the worlds of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts, the worlds of Scooby-Doo and Looney Tunes, the worlds of Tom and Jerry and the DC Extended Universe, Wonka's factory, the Polar Express and even Jump City!"
🤮
Kinda feel like they missed with not going with Jeremy Allen White dude is a spot on younger version of Gene Wilder
I hope they don't butcher my favorite novel of roald dahl.
"Not feeling it ... sorry Timmy, just meeeeh ... and musical? Nope 😅"
why isnt Wonka black?
"I think I know the moral lesson of this film. 
Everything starts off as a dream and work hard to turn that dream into a reality."
Cool
Gene Wilder will always be the real Willy Wonka!!
Meh nothing beats the Johnny depp and gene wilder movies
Ya se que es una historia de fantasía pero se me hacer extraño ver negros en traje durante la época de la revolución industrial en Inglaterra
It’s that chalameeee guy
Finally. A Willy Wonka movie that WON’T give me nightmares 😅
I WANT THISS
Since I was a teen I’ve anticipated this moment 🎉❤❤
Looks meh to me but i'm a grown man so....
WILL DEFINITELY WATCH THIS IN CINEMA! <3
"Honestly, this looks way better than I expected."
The callback to Gene Wilder won me immediately. I need to see this asap.
If it's timothee chalamet I'd watch it
I hate to say it but this looks like another here today gone tomorrow movie with no real substance
But how will this affect the Wonka-Snowpiercer theory?
THAT IS GOING TO BE SO COOL OMG IM IN TEARS😭😭😭🙌🙌
"No, thank you."
"Nope

I’m out already"
"When Wonka was young, he was forbidden to eat candy because of a giant brace extender, but that didn't stop him from fulfilling his wish."
a 3rd one dawgg aint no way
"looks woke, and cgi oompa loompas again? because there are no people who are vertically impaired."
Can't wait!!!
No one can replace old Wonka
This is going to be absolute TRASH
"They need to do a move for the book, ""Wanka and the Great Glass Elevator."""
Who asked for another Hollywood remake? Stop please!
Alternative Universe or the one that ties up with the book and the Johnny Deep's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Wonka. Although the Oompa Loompa again is from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory so meaning Snowpiercer is still in effect.
❤❤
What decade is this movie set in? It could be a classic time.
"More proof that nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood. I'm sick of this Timothee Chalamet guy getting pushed. He was good in one low budget film and has sucked in everything after. Oh, but he's friends with Speilberg's son so that explains it."
I love timothee so much and by no means is this an insult but something about timothee playing wonka is so funny 😭😭😭
A Wonka origin story. Yikes.
"I've wondered in the past if there would ever be a backstory made for this story we all already know. Honestly, I'm looking forward to watching it since it's made by an incredibly talented group of people!"
BRO AY NO WAY THIS REAL
This feels like the greatest Showman met Dr dolittle 🤣
this looks retarded.
I’m not here for it like wtf? 😂 how many remakes do we need? This $hit is getting old.
"After Willy retired and allowed Charlie to rule the factory in his place, he had a daughter named Willa, who I'll hire Demi Lovato to voice. Casey Jr. and Putt-Putt will burst through a newly revamped version of his factory while on the run from Slovene, Islandin, Ghost Train and the custard flood."
Hugh Grant never expected that....this is EPIC!
"watch, we will all be eating chocolate during the movie"
It looks lame
Yet another remake of a movie that will ruin the original and my childhood
Roman Awkinston and Hugh Grant!
This is gonna bomb...
But we still can’t get the real chocolate bars back on the shelves?!?
It would appear Johnsons Hats back on!
Great opportunity ruined with horrible casting of Chalamet's lack of personality.
"I see this is what happened to Paul after he became Muad'dib and after the birth of his son Leto II.  When he went to wander the deserts of Arrakis, he secretly became a mad chemist to produce candy."
"Doesn’t do much for me. Sorry. Long live THE WW, Gene Wilder."
this will be intresting
Ok i’m literally just watching cause paddington is the goat!
"They can make all the willy wonka movies they want, but nothing will top gene wilders version, the umpalumpas were all real people while this version of them are obviously cgi since that was hugh grant playing one"
"Ah the whistle from
Willy Wonka nice"
"Just based on this, the last looks amazing... but Timothy Chalamet is seriously giving high school production acting. Something doesn't feel right about this particular casting idk... it'll be very hard to live up to the OG Gene Wilder. Even Johnny Deppy gave such a good performance with his portrayal as Willy Wonka. TC isn't weird enough for the part... just my honest opinion."
Timothee Chalamet is going crazy with the movies!
"If Land Paste were born, it can make Willy Wonka's amazing factory a reality and his candy might be real and sold everywhere."
he's just so cute! can't wait
This will get cancelled because Hugh Grant played an oopa lupa instead of a real dwarf
Every good thing in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours. 🥹
Then there came a junior musical play besides a Broadway play and several commercials related to the confectioner.
Hugh’s not the Oompa we need but the Loompa we deserve
"This actually looks good, definitely feels like Timothy Chalamet is trying to emulate Gene Wilders Wonka, which is the only Wonka as far as I'm concerned."
JUst stop.  PleASE.
I thing the caracter is different from JD version
Will be epic
Where is Johnny Johnny
2:18 those cute hand movements though.
"After liberating Arrakis and seizing control of Spice production, Wonka, the voice from the Outer World, set his eyes on the chocolate market..."
Looks shite
So its a musical....? Work
Gene Wilder who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film died in 2018. Johnny Depp who also played Willy Wonka in the 2005 film was supposed to be recast for the sixth and final Pirates of the Caribbean film.
Trash...
No
Yet another remake out of Hollywood as there aren't any writers that are intelligent enough to create something new.
"Never thought I would want a Willy Wonka origin movie, I cant wait to finally agree on one Wonka movie instead of fighting over nostalgia vs remakes"
Excited for the movie! Let’s gooooo
Why do we need this?  A third movie…..you have got to be kidding me.
Timothée Chalamet's line delivery in this trailer has about as much spark as a first read.
Tbh we all are having a feeling that Johnny did it better😢
Now that i think about it I wouldn't be surprised if Willy Wonka's wife is  Mary Poppins
What did I just watch? Nice movie but very very different from the original 2 movies don’t know how I feel but might be good 👍
I love how whimsical it is. Very true to the feel of the original and I have faith in the Director of Paddington to create a masterpiece.
I was not prepared to see Hugh Grant in that form whatsoever.
"FINALLY a sweet, wholesome movie 😭😭"
Legend Willy wonka is back ❤️ this movie going show how he started 💫 can't wait this December have good treat for us 💖
First it was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. Then in 2005 we got a more book accurate movie called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Now we are getting a new movie called WONKA. Fine let's run it back hopefully one last time.
I was kinda hoping Johnny Depp to have a cameo here....even Charlie....something of a little throwback story telling wouldn't you say
He needs to be weirder. He’s not weird enough to be Wonka
This looks horrible
Paddington's directory? Hmmmmm this gonna be a great one.
We are finally getting a origin story of the crazy man that is Willy Wonka this is gonna be awesome
"and of course regardless of the time period a movie is set in it's as multicultural as ""current year"" lmao"
"i mean, Wonka's accent shouldn't be a bit British mix with other accent since he's been around the world? just asking,, 🤔"
The chocolate must flow.
"I'm gonna be honest, I was very hesitant about this film.  As of this trailer, I'm going to see this in the theater."
"Willy wonka is my childhood memories.
I remember I always mesmerized and excited when I watch that movie all the time in my TV
And here now, I'm crying because this trailer makes me bringing back my childhood memories 😢"
MATTHEW BAYNTON
The acting seems bad. Pedo Disney must not be able to afford better actors since they chose to go woke and are going broke.
Personally I would’ve casted someone that is not white as Wonka. That whole white person being the main character is just so overdone in Hollywood 😑
Smh
"Whoever is playing wonka, his acting and delivery is just stunted and awful"
This looks great
Something tells me chocolate sales will go straight through the roof and everyone's butt this Christmas season! Diabolically Delicious Loved the original classic with Gene Wilder and hopefully this one will be a new classic for kids of today. Nice!
Took ya long enough
i was wondering how wonka get his return of investment or break event point in such a great dance like that?
"Glad they didn't make him black. 

Oh wait, this is Warner Bros. not Disney or Netflix."
Looks great
"If they avoid the evils of wokism (leftism) then it will be a success. Hopefully Hollywood/Disney losing over ten billion the past few years pushing that insanity has finally taught them something, but leftists rarely admit they are wrong let alone learn."
the next Johnny Depp right here
Not looking forward to this
Looks mid ngl
Now that would definitely be a very interesting movie to watch 😎👀🦋😇👍
"i have two firm opinions regaurding this trailer.  1) Chalemette is just Adam Driver's younger brother, and 2) I am 100% seeing it because of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa"
ugh.
No thanks I’ll stick with the original.
He seems…. So normal
"No wonder his chocolate is so good, he probably adds the spice melange to it 🙂"
Nope.
Timmothy so overrated I swear
0:41  explain this is worst
"gee they're giving this guy every big roles right now , he gives me the same vibe as ezra miller don't know why , the ""hollywood broken baby"" vibe .."
Helluva cast
He's not good for the role
He doesn’t fit the character
I haven't even watched the first one and they've already made a second
"this movie gonna be a bomb, ain't no way replacing Johny deep"
I can't wait for WONKA!!!!
ANOTHER REMAKE!!!! Hollywood is devoid of originality and dreaming up new worlds to explore.
anyone else feel this actor isn't very good? he doesnt really sell willy wonka. its just his regular voice slightly pitched up but thats it. its like 10% the effort of chris pratt doing mario
Nah its tooo woke there not supposed to have a black woman or colored people in this movies damn..
WILLY WONKA OMG OMG OMG
I took a trip to the chocolate factory to make it out
“How do you like it? Dark? White? Nutty?” 💀
This looks so bad. They are making him pretty much Marry Poppins.
Yeah man. THIS. I'm looking forward to THIS. And LOVE the call backs to the original. Nice.
They got the cinematographor that worked on OLDBOY for this movie💀
Is that Rowan Atkinson? Well I am gonna watch this.
Bruh just think of a new thing already
This looks really good.
"All I can think is that some time between this movie and the 'Charlie' classic, he's gonna end up firing that girl and all those other people."
can't believe they gave him a black love interest
"Sorry, I’m not buying this guy playing Wonka.. not feeling it"
Why?!
"I did like Paddington, but I'll wait for the Critical Drinkers review before spending money."
First saw this I thought “ how are they going to ruin Willy Wonka?” But based on the trailer it looks ok. See how it goes.
Nope. This looks terrible.
"This is a MASTERPIECE. Give Tim the Oscar already. Wilder can't hold a candle to ol' Timmy. Well, except for my boy Depp! HAHA fr though."
I can't wait to never watch this. RIP Gene Wilder you'll never be topped.
I'm pretty sure that the Christmas of 2023 will be chocolatey. I wanna watch that film!
Tim Burton's looked way better
"I don’t know who this Wonka is, but he doesn’t seem like he fits the part. No where even near the personality of Wilder or Depp. Both wonkas were dark but comedic, this guy is neither"
"This lacks the same feeling that the original movie had, just another sequel, prequel, remake, reboot, reimagining, whatever it is, that lacks the charm and appeal of the original film."
So excited ❤❤
This looks amazing!!
Im more hyped for this than the fnaf movie
Why is this giving me cringe
This looks really good.
Oh boy.
Johnny Depp wannabe
Where’s Johnny depp?
There is something super off putting and uncanny about this trailer. I can’t put my finger on it but I’m disturbed
looks fun and good!
"First I was like “meh”
Then I was like “seems promising”
Finally I was like “yes”"
"Really excited for this, but I hope that the blacks only play a minor part rather than a main role."
Stupid
Wow! A snowpiercer prequel
"You can now watch Wonka played by any actor, courtesy of AI."
This looks very promising
Looks good
"Finally something old plus something new, instead of something old all retold."
"All the sounds made very excited, yet I remain deeply skeptical... Although Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa has softened my skepticism, ever so slightly."
"Only completely dummies would actually like this, but given this is a yank channel that checks out significantly."
Getting serious David Thrasher vibes… he should be playing this role 100%
This and the Barbie movie trailers have left me feeling like I'm back in 1999 when movies still had some magic.
good actor but horrible choice for wonka
Idc what ppl say this is a prequel to the Johnny depp Charlie and the chocolate factory
So the joker is wonker now... Well alrighty then
This must be Willy Wonka’s backstory
Ooh ok I might watch ☺️
"I love Timothée Chalamet, but he isn't right for this style. Comes off superficially performative. Perhaps the full movie will be better"
"Paddington? Ayo, this is already a bagner."
"Lol...there are no ""laws of gravity"". Gravity is simply a theory. Keep the programming alive."
I’m glad that it’s rooted in the same sort of look that the 1971 film is. I’m very much looking forward to seeing this film!
"Well at least it's a prequel to the gene wilder version and not the Johnny Depp version, thank heavens. Nice to here pure imagination and umpa lumpa tune. 
Don't care how I want to watch it nowwwww"
"So, how woke is this one going to be?"
this defiantly has the Magic as Paddinton and it has the heart as the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
THIS is going to be the best film of 2023 and nobody is gonna tell me otherwise.
Can't wait until Christmas!!! 😁🎄😌
Absolute shait
WOW.. that actually looks good !
Johny depp?
Sooo a remake of a reboot that has now been remade into a prequel.
"If you would have told me that there would be a Willy Wonka movie starring Timothée Chalamet I wouldn""t have believed you yet here we are. Though its odd im excited! haha"
What an obvious flop.  Who asked for this movie?   
does Hugh Grant enslave his people to escape the glass jar?
Wonka: Before the Madness 🍫
Willie Potter 😮
"Will you guys make a Tolkien's story about war in the north? Based on the novel of course,so the story between Hobbit and LotR will be completed."
surprisingly i choose to read the novel for the first time recently so wonkas been on my mind lately. this definitely looks interesting hopefully will be better then Depps version that one was always a little cringey for me growing up. after reading the book yeah that one is not as good or close as wilder version imo.
Whoooooaaaaa
whose up wonking their willy rn
မျှော်နေပါပီ👏👏😍
"I hate trailers nowadays, they show most of the movie makes no sense."
This ain't it chief
This lacks soul.
Guys its my bar timothee
I got Johnny Depp and my future kids are gonna get this boring dude 😂😂😂
"In an alternate universe we get a less whimsical, slightly darker version of this with Jeremy Allen White as a younger Wonka but not an origin story."
"Seeing Rowan Atkinson as the priest, i can only think of his priest stand up bits xDDD ahhh… it looks like it’s going to be an awesome movie :)"
Willy Wonka was our childhood.
So we get to find out why Willy wonka created that creepy tunnel?
Paul atreides made a lucrative business selling chocolate after escaping arrakis
this loooks like such a good movie. my jaw was dropped during the whole trailer xD
Mr. Bean?
I love Paddington 😭😭❤️❤️
t-t-t-t-t-TIMOTHY...... CHALAMET!!! My gorgeous honey bun sugar poo is playing willy wonkaaaaaa
oh God no why do they need to ruin everything with remakes
Why so many remixes Can’t  anybody invent their own movie? What a shame
I'm excited for the oompa loompas
Wow…..this looks terrible 😂
I like just about everyone in this.
"1. It wasn't chocolate that made people float, it was fizzy lifting drink.  ENDLESS TRASH."
No.
"*See's title and thumbnail* 

Okay you have my curiosity 


*Watches the video* 

Now you have my attention"
"Mathew Baynton, Paterson Joseph, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, the director of Paddington - this is gonna be a banger"
Happy to see Mr.Bean
"Perfect casting, great director...it's got a chance. <3"
"Warner Bros has been rancid since last year, but this....




.....this had my curiosity. But now it has my attention."
Is this sequel or prequel ?
Rowan Atkinson was such a surprise. Cant wait to see this in cinemas! 🥰
"Timothy Chalemet is really good, but why? And although I saw no song and dance nonsense in the trailers it just reeks of it in all the scenes...
I hate musicals..."
So is it a full on musical? or just kinda dispersed in and out like the original?
finally Timmy.Tim's time.❤❤❤
I was meh 🫤 until I saw Hugh grant when I busted up laughing 😂. You’ve got my attention. Johnny drop gave quite 5e memorable performance. I’m interested to see more of this one.
Plot Twist: the Girl accidentally dies and Wonka goes from fun-loving  eccentric to a deranged recluse.
LGBT+2Toaster child groomer
"""Quiet up and listen down""
I must now use this line.

Also, it's brilliant that this releases 
on Day 42 of Dune 2's Theater Release
only 45 day timefame.
1 Chalemet movie followed by a 
second Chalemet movie!"
"Another POS nobody wanted or asked for! Hollywood is dead, and good riddance!"
Alright you got me. Im in.
waaankaaa
Now this looks like it would be worth seeing
Is that Alan Johnson?
I love that the mom from Paddington is in this
I've never seen so many bot accounts.
You had me at chocolate cartel
Definitely gonna be a masterpiece ❤
Well it definitely seems like an origin story from the original Willy Wonka but I'm just saying does anybody not care what Charlie Bucket is doing I mean he won the prize to be the new chocolate mankatha and yet they never continued his story
"Hugh Grant, baby!"
"OMG this is my favorite movie. I'm so glad to see this is coming out. I still love the original, but this one looks awesome. Come on Christmas ⛄"
I thought this was a joke it first. Oh my God I don’t know how to feel.
Jonka
Nope
I love the British cast
"One of the few origin stories that’s actually worthwhile and interesting. I do find these origin movie titles odd though. Why do it always have to be just one word that’s part of the character’s name? Weird trend, not terrible, just find it amusing. Either way looks fun."
Please just use the score for the trailers so we don't just get the THX deafening.
Astounding. I had no idea what to expect from this film and once I saw the trailer it felt so obvious and perfect. I haven’t been this excited for a movie in a while. Great work
Why?
warner bros having the year of their life
I hated paddington bear as a kid…. Why do they keep regurgitating all the same stuff over and over… this cashing in on nostalgia is getting old AF.
High grant was unexpected in the best way possible
"At first when I heard about this movie, I was like "" no one can play kooky Willy Wonka like Johnny  Depp"". But this looks amazing and I want to see it ."
What’s lil Mabu doing in this trailer?
Thought this was another Wes Anderson AI Generated Hypothetical Trailer. That’s a bit of a mouthful to say out loud.
"Sold as soon as they said ""Chocolate Cartel""."
Meh
Woah
yikes
This is going to be amazing!
i woke up this morning and said to myself...we need another willie wonka movie......said no one ever
"1:55 Willy Wonka: Mark my words
Genshin Players: Vengeance Will Be Mine"
I wish Anthony Hopkins played the Oompa Loompa
Looks good and all but there'd better be some Snowpiercer nods.
I’m something of a magician myself
"The Paddington director behind it gives me hope it’ll be good. But unless it’s an amazing movie, I don’t think anyone was really asking for a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"
God he’s just the cutest 🔥…
I didn't know Daniel Thrasher was an actor lol
Mr. bean? am sold
i thought this was a JOKE ur telling me this is an actual movie
Looks better than the Burton version
Creepy
Sally Hawkins 🥲
I like Chalamet but his acting just doesn't feel right here. Gene Wilder left awfully big shoes to fill
0/10 no willy
"This feels... weak.
Ask The Gods."
OMG YES FINALLY
"Hugh Grant as an Oompa - Loompa, Keegan-Michael Key as an old-time police officer, Rowan Atkinson as a priest (he's always been good at that role), and Timothee Chalamet in a top hat...I don't now what I'm more excited for :):):)
I didn't know Timothee could sing and this looks pretty musical, so I'm excited for that too"
The Academy please be good to Timmy this time!
My childhood x1000
"To be honest, I've been nostalgic for 2 days since yesterday by watching clips from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but suddenly this WONKA movie trailer appears wow it feels like Dejavu man."
This actually looks wonderful. Children and adults need this 💜
Is this a joke ?
Yeah I think I’m gonna pass on this one
I thought this was an SNL sketch…
Oh my ♥️this looks Wonderful 🍫🍫🍫🍫
One parte Is of 2005 and the other part Is 1971
Aww man… I’m excited for this…  but why did I feel like Daniel Radcliffe could have been amazing as Wonka
Honestly this is great . Maybe we get to see him visiting the oompa loopa lands and meeting them.
Okay but why though?
This looks like garbage
"The first few seconds I wondered if they relocated the factory to Hogwarts and then I see ""And The Producer of Harry Potter"" so that question was answered."
"Great another movie that fat shames todays youth into seeking unattainable beauty standards. Good'ol Willa Wonka, played, by a skinny white guy. You can always count on him..."
WONKA: A tale of diabetes
This looks really bad
Tom holland as Willy Wonka?
Looks great. I'm in.
xD not a chocolate cartel....
Timothee Chalamet going from a serious hardcore Sci-Fi film with Dune Part 2 to a light heartwarming holiday fantasy film with Wonka in the span of a month will keep me interested for the end of 2023 for sure!
0:50 Tell me why the actor kinda sounds like Daniel thrasher but its not
I'm just happy it's not made by Disney.
"Hmm....not sure,"
Another project to dump some money in the toilet. Didn't know WB had any extra money left.
"SIgn me up, i was scared at first but damn this looks good. and the oompa loompas are orange again!!!!!"
"As an adult, this looks decent, though I wasn’t sold on chalamets acting in this clip 😬 I don’t see kids being into this though. My daycare kids and my own kiddo are obsessed with the Johnny depp one!"
looking forward 😃
"""Muad'Dib and the Chocolate Factory -  The Candy Must Flow"""
Looks good
This is the 3rd movie of Wonka. Have we seriously ran out of ideas 😢
Is Wilbur Wonka gonna be in this?
Ugh...I can't stand Chalamet. He's completely wrong for this roll. Never gonna watch it.
"Sorry, still prefer the original."
An origin story of pure imagination! 🍫
"They’re leaning too hard into comedy, and not enough into the weird fantasy elements of the other two movies."
No
dunno about this...
Not the faux southern accent 😭
How about we stop remaking the same stories over and over again and make movies about new ones? Or take a movie that was terrible and remake it if you don't have an idea of your own.
WB is incapable of relating to its audience or understanding what it is they think we want to watch. Js.
Mr.Bean what are you doing? 🤣🤣🤣
"⌐_⌐ If ever anyone needed an example that Pedowood is entirely out of ideas, this is the crystalization of that..."
this is gonna be my joker
Oh dear. No.
Ugh
Why couldn’t we get Kevin Hart as an Oompa Loompa?
I ws skeptical when i first heard about this movie but it looks very magical and feelgood. Just what i need right now lol
Why can't they just get midgets...
"Still not sure of Timothee in this role, he seems to slip into that NY accent a bit here, but the man behind Paddington and Rowan have got my attention."
johnny depp's wonka was also awesome
INC woke pile of trash!!!
"This looks amazing! Now, let’s make Creatures of Conquest 🏴‍☠️⚓️🐅"
"1:03 caught me off guard...😂🤣, He gonna be the best Priest ever..🤭"
Look how diverse this movie is! They must feel great about themslves
"Regardless of how the film looks or feels to me, as Hollywood rips out old franchises all the time. Having had gene wilder pass away who is easily still the best WONKA. Timothy looks like a perfect casting choice as he has the adolescent facial features of a young gene wilder."
Havent said NOPE this fast in almost a full year.
This just doesn’t give any Willy wonka vibes at all
"Just wondering how many people ask for this?
Answer EVERYONE WHO SAW THE ORIGINAL MOVIE HAVE BE ASKING FOR THIS MOVIE."
I want chocolate now
"Looks boring and with a forced inclusion of a female black character, that character should have been played by an Oompa Loompa. Also the main character doesn't look weird or menacing, just sissy and sensible."
Hah ! Apakah saya melihat mathilda ??? 😂😂😂😂😂
"I like the costuming and set design. They had an appealing use of color, imo."
No but this is actually so cute??? It seems like a really nice movie I can’t wait (plus it’s timothee so ofc I’m watching)
Looks really really bad
Oh look another Hollywood rehash
"Ah! Another Willy Wonka, 
🌈REIMAGINED🌈 - - Aggressively socialising Africans and Europeans together as forcefully and desperately as possible… Imagine my shock.

Who nose which tribe is responsible for this concerted effort to forcefully encourage mixing between these two very different groups..?🤔"
This might actually be fun
🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
This guy just has one of those faces you want to punch
This film gives me the vibe of early 2000’s 🎉
Just in Time for awards season!
already a classic. already a classic.
I think casting Timotheé Chalamet as wonka is a great idea. It makes me reminisce about Johnny Depp's character as Willy Wonka.
It's another willy Wonka movie??? 😮
oh its a musical? guess im never seeing it
"At first I watched this expecting just another garbage hollywood remake of an older movie with some kind of agenda shoved in..

But after watching the trailer, wow! This feels like a movie I'm definitely going to go and see, just lighthearted fun with how Wonka came to be and how he started off. It's about time we had a wholesome, upbeat movie again among all the action, dark and broody and ""serious"" movies! It gave me the same vibe the Mario movie did, simply a fun movie trailer."
Uhhg another unoriginal film
Idk I know all these comments are positive and I’m probably gonna get hate but I just don’t think that Timothee is a good Wonka. I mean Johnny Depp was kinda weird and scary but he was a great wonka. Gene Wilder was obviously the best one. But Timothee is just nah. Only good thing ab this is that Rowan Atkinson’s in it
Shut up and tell me where the Ticket is....
"I love Timmy, but just why? Hollywood is releasing cringey prequels for absolutely no reason at all. 👀😂"
Is anyone going to make a movie about Charlie as owner of the factory?
What just happening?
"Love Willy Wonka and his story. Love people of all colors and creeds. Don't iove inserts and retcons to original material that does not belong there though. Not just characters, but events and additions. All are contaminants to me. This is probably a nice movie that did not need to get made and will likely not do well. Just being honest."
I love the old one but I know this is gonna be a great movie
Hollywood has no original ideas anymore. Art is dead.
Timothée Chalamet will never top Gene Wilder’s portrayal of Willy Wonka.  But I guarantee he’ll be better than Johnny Depp’s portrayal.
Жопка
"I wasn't sold at all until the end, THAT was funny"
I can’t wait to see the part when Wonka goes insane and starts plotting various ways to kill selfish children
If you watch this movie I will kill you
Another Willy wonka movie mmm idk
This looks good 😊
This looks dreadful
"Finally, a biopic created as a masterpiece. Now tell me if its not that amazing"
This looks very promising!
Ah i wish they make a part where wonka meet charlie grandpha it's better change that girl with him just that who make me dissapointed
are they gonna show the part where willy wonka enslaves a tribe of pigmies lmao
Why did I remember Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory being kind of a horror film…
He even bring his own slave
"Me: Oh my god, can they just leave Willy Wonka alo-
Movie: “They’ve all been crushed by the Chocolate Cartel.”
Me: …..You have my attention…."
I can't wait!
For wonka's and gene wilders sakes please be good....  anything is better than the god awful Depp version
Why?  Serious question.
Riddled with blacks 😢
So it's just another timothee looking like timothee
I get the sense he's more of a young Gene Wilder Wonka in this version. I'm glad.
Hollywood is CORNY AF
WE CAN'T WAITTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Bro that cinematic version of the music got me!
This looks absolutely awful. Not even close to the magic of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.
More garbage RE-MADE
The casting is so 2023 Disney - everything looks so politically correct
How wholesome ❤❤❤
"""From the director of Paddington"" A MASTERPIECE IS COMING"
i love her lack of energy go girl give us nothing!
Que gracia 😢
"Please, for this one, no LGBTQ stuff... Just bring the Magic Back"
This looks very interesting movie
Capitalism LOL
Our king returns 😃
"Honestly I love how endearing and comfortable Timothee is in the role. It's like he amplifies the ""feel-good"" and whimsical tones of the film really well. I also like how they showed us that Willy Wonka struggles, without shoving it down our throats. Can't wait for this"
I still miss Johnny Depp's version
This looks awful..
I can’t wait😍
"I'm still skeptical, but I'll admit that by the end with the Oompa Loompa, they had me wanting to see it."
I was nervous until I saw Paddington.
"Film looks like it could be excellent, but I do not think Chalamet was the right choice for Wonka. Nothing magical about him or his performance."
Another remake? The original is always the best
Oh Elio!
OMG I CANT WAIT
"CAN WE NOT, PLEASE?!"
Mr beans can speak???
I've never been so ready for anything in my life. (Unless your talking about the new Barbie movie)
I can literally see myself watching this on christmas eve with my family and friends in the dim-lit living room enjoying our drinks and chips. It makes me excited for Christmas😭❤️
IM SUPER EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE
I didn't want to like this trailer and I really did! Great job.
"The tagline tho ""how Willy become Wonka"" 😂"
"He spends 7 years perfecting his craft 
😂 dude is 20 years old"
I can’t wait to see this!
This movie's going to be a wonderful journey and I can't wait!
Nice
Wow this actually looks like it’s gonna be good a lot better than anything this year.
"Just don't do any woke thing here, anythings else it will be a childhood memory coming back😍😍"
😂👌👌👌👌👌👌👌👌
this looks good? actually
"England in the Early 20th century ""checks all the boxes!""Bravo😂"
"Timothy did not sound right for the role.. then I saw him and thought.. ""wait a second.. he actually looks pretty good as a young Willy Wonka"" and then he opened his mouth.. and I thought ""yep.. nope.. I was right.. """
IS THAT ALAN JOHNSON
🙄
This is giving Disney live action remake energy
50 years ago I saw the original version of Willy Wonka and it seems to me that this one does not ask for anything I think I'm going to Love ❤
this is the worst film ever made
"Conflicted. I did not like this trailer at all. But I know Paddington is great and I liked the tagline ""How Willy Became Wonka"". I think that's genius but the whole tone is not working for me."
Here’s a movie that no one asked for.
Looks great. I shouldn’t have watched the whole trailer though.
Why?...why?.....why not something original? Whyyyyyyy????🙄🙄🙄🙄🙄
Couldn’t even make it through the trailer👎🏼👎🏼👎🏼
Looks good. Reminds me of Jingle Jangle & the Greatest Showman. 😊
Excited to see this. Seems like a really charming film.
Do we honestly need an origin story for Willy Wonka?
I hate how Willy Wonka looks so much like Karl from Mr beast
I thought it was gonna be another remake I’m so happy it’s a different story. It looks really cute ☺️
A movie no one asked for with a comment section full of big tiddy robots telling me it's gonna be amazing. Oddly similar to the last crappy trailer I watched... Would of preferred him working on the Dune movies more instead of wasting time tryna out Wonka Johnny Depp in another souless reboot.
"This is going to flop big time. Chalamet is a completely overrated shithouse actor, and his Willy Wonka is so flat and vapid that I can't believe he was cast in the first place."
"OMG, just how many iterations of Wonka are we going to have to endure? How many ways are there to tell this story? It has now joined the ranks of the many monsters that Hollywood couldn't kill (e.g. Frankenstein, Dracula, Werewolf, Jason, etc., etc., etc.). 

Only Santa should be revisited each year.😉"
"Do they seriously think they have breathe life into every dying franchise 
Not like they could take inspiration from existing properties and make something original 
No that would take actual writing ✍️ 

Prediction _this will be every whimsical outcast trying to prove themselves story in every prequel /origin story"
I nearly broke my jaw when I saw the OG Oompa Loompa
Timothee Chalamet that’s all I need to see watching this for sure grew up when the first one came out with Gene Wilder! My favorite childhood movie
There's no blackies I'm woka world
I knew the tag scene would be an oompa loompa fr
"Ladies, gentlemen and noble person: I present to you the next Tumblr sexyman"
oooo...this gonna be good!
Bro wtf is this? Twinky Wonka and the sh!tst!ck factory?
TOTAL GARBAGE!!!
"At first was like
Oh no
But then i was like
Oh wait, this i like!

Its an orgin! An im for it!"
"Hugh Grant, OMGoodness...this looks sweet."
Oh my gosh i can’t wait to see wonka with my sister
🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤔🤮
"Based on this, it looks like it captures the feel of the original"
Who is this movie for????? Hollywood is on crack.
Yes!! I’m so seeing this.
This made me irritated. 😤😤😤😡
i love this already welp xd
Timothy completely miscast.
Can't believe they cast Karl as Mr. Beast in this Feastables documentary
"Sigh... It better be good cause I was obsessed with Tim Burton's remake of the Classic Charlie movie.
Lol - Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. Epic."
"I'm sorry but this is horribly cast. Nothing about Timothy is remotely Wonka like. He's not quirky or fun, he's bland, unemotive and unconvincing. No amount of CGI can cover up the lack of talent."
Wow I never considered it before but he makes a perfect Wonka
"I was skeptical when this film was first announced, but I now have to admit that this look scrumdiddlyumptious. 

I just hope it has the wallpaper where the snozberries taste like snozberries."
1:02 and MR. BEAN became a great priest/pope
Literally no one asked for this.
they just had to have a joo playing wonka
Ok why isn’t Johnny Depp wonka ?!?!?
The only way to make this worse is to put zendaya in it
Willy Wonka is supposed to be a horror movie
oooh fun!
This looks stupid.
"“It’s too late, I’ve already started dancing, we can’t stop now.”😂"
"I grew up rewatching the original movie countless times, so this hits home in such a good way."
"Ohhhhooooo
The OG Oompa Loompas"
nice
"This movie has already been made twice. Make something original, you clowns!"
Another remake.
A nice entertaining movie to watch around Christmas time... Sounds Good!
It doesn’t look that good
I'm sold
The third? Is there going to be a eighth in many years?
0:05 I’m something of an inventor myself “ 🎃
"did anyone wonder what happened before CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLAT FACTORY?
☝️ i do!
⬇️ *AND YOU?*"
Ummm
Rowan Atkinson is that you? 1:42
Chálamet is a decent actor. But this is gonna flop. You can tell he’s acting. He doesn’t seem like a natural for the role.
You know what they say 3rd time the charm. Let's see if this movie will be good.
"every time he speaks I think he's going to talk in a british accent😭
i think i prefer the british accent but this is okay as well"
"Great trailer bro. This looks good, hopefully it is as good as Paddington 2."
The Hugh Grant reveal should have been kept for the movie. Stop giving everything away in trailers Hollywood!
Someone ought to tell Paul Atreides's twin here that his off-planet brother is in desperate need of resources and military assistance
He does NOT give willy Wonka vibes at all!💀
MR. BEAN IS HERE DOING A CAMEO!
Hopefully I'll be getting my golden movie ticket by Christmas. 🎟🤤 🍫
Is this supposed to be a prequel to the 1970s one ?
Where is johnny depp and charlie????
So...Wonka Begins
Ey hold up did i see Mr Bean running 😂😂😂😂
"Think of something new Hollywood! Why SO MANY Wonka movies?!
It's so weird..."
"""Literally 99% of people ignore this message: God save you and your family from the diseases 😎🙏”"
how are there 2 types of ooppma loompas
"I wish he would do Gene Wilder’s subtly insane Wonka, not Johnny Depp’s absolutely nutty over-the-top version; he just doesn’t sell it for some reason. He’s a cute actor with nice hair, but his attempts to act like Johnny Depp are off-putting. It’s the subtlety of Gene Wilder’s performance that made the audience ask, ""Is he insane or is he a genius?"" That made the Willy Wonka character so interesting and memorable, and as terrible as the remakes are, Wilder is the reason why the remakes exist."
"Dont know, just seems like a kid thats trying to act like an older man"
Rowan Atkinson❤
"This looks cute and good, I’ll watch it but I don’t think it’s gonna be as good as the other two"
"Excuse me, but it's 🤮"
Can't wait to see how the woke have ruined this classic.
It’s mr bean!! Yay
Is Willy Wonka magical?
"Bro this is way better than I thought it would be. I thought it was like a movie made by a young director and not a big budget,but Omg insane directors and ROWAN ATKINSON??😮"
Wrong casting on Wonka.
Chalamet is the most unconvincing Wonka possible. The film is saved only by the spirit of Paddington.
its giving yikes and cringe because timothee looks so unnatural as wonka. he shoudve never been cast
You had me at Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa
"I’m glad they took a different path with the plot in this film and didn’t try to remake the movie. It would be hard to top Johnny Depp’s performance. But this looks good, I’m excited to check it out. Timothee was a good choice."
i just wish we get more lore about the oompa loompas
"Can’t lie, I’m not feeling it"
"Sally Hawkins plays the perfect mom. Loved her in Paddington, can’t wait to see her performance in this. Even if it’s minor."
GO SEE SOUND OF FREEDOM INSTEAD OF THIS GARBAGE
5.8/10
Damn these Hollywood executives have really ran out of original ideas.
"Key is hilarious, he's gonna steal the show."
Omg it's gonna flop so hard
Who else just got done Wonkin dey Willy to this trailer?
"Woah, this cast...🤯"
No. I dont like It.
chocolate rain
I think I'll stick to Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
I'll give them credit for not making Wonka balck.
The original with Gene Wilder was pure magic when I was a kid. The one with Johnny Depp sucked. This doesn't look much better.
Wait Mr. Bean is also in this movie that's great
"He's 15 years old?  and travelled the world the last nearly 10 years in search of chocolate stuff?  so since he was 5?!?  C'mon, be real"
No
"Come on, how can you improve on the 1971 version starring Gene Wilder, Jack Albertson, and Peter Ostrum as Charlie? Charlie`s kind heartedness and Gene Wilder`s eccentricity made for a memorable movie experience.  When Charlie opens the wrapper a little and glimpses the golden ticket , I was so happy for him, that scene was so well done. Great Movie.

TImothy doesn`t seem quirky enough or charismatic enough to keep the audience interested.  Hope I am wrong and this version is a big hit."
Guess all the black people left the neighborhood when Willy Wonka got older 😂
Hollywood make an original property challenge (impossible). To be fair this doesn't look bad but please stop with the remakes and reboots
"This looks really, really good."
Johnson from Peep Show? I'm sold.
"Great cast, but I don't hold high hopes for this. Too bad Christopher Lee isn't there to be the creepy dentist dad again. :P"
"Thus completes the Willy Wonka Saga....
Wonka, Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, and Snowpiercer.
You're welcome."
"I'm not gonna lie at first I clicked on this real pessimistic, like ""who asked for this"" - but this trailer's really brought me around - there's a real sense of just fun and whimsy I wasn't expecting."
"I was getting some heavy Harry Potter vibes and then they hit me with ""Producer of Harry Potter"". Go figure."
A willy wonka prequel movie is a great idea and Timothy Chalmet playing a young version of the character was fantastic casting. Also Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is something I never thought would work so well
"I hope this movie ends with Willy devising up the plan for the golden ticket and releasing them out to the world, teasing Charlie!"
"I hate the idea of Wonka's past being explored (that terrible Johnny Depp version is a nice example of that), but... this one has my curiosity."
"Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant?? I love it already! 🥰🙌🏽 Paddington was such a good movie, I just know the storytelling will be great 💯"
I can't believe Matthew Baynton is in this movie! I grew up with horrible histories so it's great to see him back
SUPER FLOP
From the producers of Harry Potter?? I'm definitely watching
"It’s a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate factory’s iconic Willy Wonka, it’s Timothee Chalamet, and it was produced by the producer of Harry Potter? I’m watching this as soon as it comes out."
Smash or Pass
Seeing wherever this movie takes place 100% made me replay to see if that Snowpiercer theory was true 😂😂
"Once i saw Mr.Chalamet i knew this was going to be a great movie.
I've watched Dune 10 times now..he is an outstanding actor."
The famous Willy Wonka returns with an origin of his story
Looks pants 🤔🤣🤦
"I think Timothee has embodied the Wonka character very well. The amount of energy that he has to tell his story is incredible, and this movie is already a masterpiece and storyteller-driven… I’m actually excited for this film to come out!"
"I dunno, I'm just not buying Chalamet's Wonka for some reason...I'll still go see it, of course, hopefully he surprises me."
*Wonka*
🔥🔥🔥 Mr Bean 🔥🔥🔥
"cast of paddington making a wonka movie

seriously didn’t know i really needed this (yessss we do)"
I guess this would be the woke version of Willy Wonka? 🙄💤
"Not sure i feel about Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, but who knows it might be real good"
For a second there I thought Wonka was being played by a familiar surgeon...
Milk it until it moos.
"This looks like so much fun, especially seeing Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa."
Johnny Depp
"My favorite part was when Wonka snaps the neck of an Oompa Loompah and yells, ""IT'S GOBSTOPPING TIME!"""
It's a surprise for me to learn that there were so many black people lived in England in early 20th century. 😄
who up wonkin they willy rn
"I thought this was gonna be the musical when he said ""Scratch that, reverse it."" Disappointed."
I would have liked to go see this movie at the cinema at Christmas 🎄
Wonka- The Chocolate maker.
The choc must flow
I’m getting a lot of Harry Potter lol and I like it
"First it's Napoleon, now it's Wonka. WTF is going on!!??? Banger after banger."
Not even 5 seconds in timothy acting doesn’t fit Wonka….its like an emo kid trying to be a cool football guy..
At first I was skeptical... now im intrigued.
This willy Wonka movie seems less sinister than the previous ones and i'm here for it
this is cool and all but why is there a third willy wonka movie being remade???
Not sure Chalamet has the whimsy for this role but Paddington was a blast so I am hopeful
"So the extended trilogy is this, Charlie and the chocolate factory, and snow piercer. Got it.

(Look up the Wonka snow piercer theory, it's probably wrong but super cool)"
Hopefully it is better than that ghastly Johnny Depp mess Tim Burton did ages ago....
Doesn’t have the charisma to play Wonka…
NO NO NO
Our culture has reached a dead end. Everything is recycled.
Oompa Oompa...hehe
If there isnt a black non binary character i ain't watching.
Why?
Pass
MATT 💖
feel good garbage with a hint of woke
Timothy🤩🤩🤩🤩
So who’s the little girl how does she fit into the story
Jesus this looks so bad and of course the replacement of Charlie’s has to be black and a girl Becouse female empowerment  yall
"aiight aiight, i am actually excited and looking forward to seeing this prequel, ever since the original i always wanted the proper story of how he got his start"
"0:05
Norman Osborne: I'm something of a scientist myself"
Didn't think I'd be interested but I AM!
"Definitely for kids, that´s OK. The last part with the Umpa-Lumpa made me laugh."
Oh no… no no no no no… please stop Warner Bros…
Enough with the reboots Hollywood try something different.
How many times are they going to remake this movie? No original scripts?
Iooks terribIe 🤣
I hope they include his dad as the oppressive dentist.
Thank god Depp is not this
I can't believe you've managed to miss the mark this greatly...this looks worse than the Johnny Depp one.
Mr. Bean!!! 😂 I can’t wait for Christmas!!!
It's been a while since a movie gave me a sense of childhood wonder🎉
Garbage
Johny depp still better
He's giving me jonah from superstore vibes haha
Looks like the perfect movie for Christmas
This looks really wholesome and proper for Christmas time. The men and old women mad in the comments please shut up you're not the target audience
"Nothing like the book. Okay why, I had so high hopes for this. And I love Chalamet but he simply doesn't have that Willy Wonka energy."
Dumb
So excited for this!
Seems alright. I feel like I can play a better willy wonka than timothee though
1:41 Mr.Bean!!!
"They had me in the first 10 seconds when they played the beginning of ""Pure Imagination."" ❤"
More woke drivel……there’s nothing like the original. Jesus can someone come up with an original script? Perhaps just do the Wilder version with an all urban cast? And film it in Harlem?
I will be seated and accounted for
I can't wait to watch this film
"Well, they got their Grammy requirement covered. Lets see how woke dark chocolate can be."
💀💀😂
MR. BEAN?!?!
"Wonka movie sounds and looks great👏🏻Applaud to the director, casts and all the people behind the scene for this amazing adaptation of Willy Wonka. I really anticipate this🤭"
This looks terrible.
Another Wonka movie but they won't do the glass elevator? Why?
I like chalamet but he does not fit this role at all.
"@1:07 ""is that normal pooing you're doing?"""
"This is perfect replica of the classic Will Wonka from his past and the respect from the original movie, RIP Gene Wilder."
Jesus this looks wonderful. Timothee Chalmet is one of the most talented actors on the planet right now.
More like wanka
Okay Paddington is fine but is it the same director as Paddington 2?
"Every movie, commercial, and ads have a token Black now. This is getting ridiculous and ruined diversity."
I could've done without the child sidekick. I'm interested in Wonka not some unnecessary tagalong.
"I'm in
 Looks like a great Christmas time movie!"
How woke will this movie be?
Proof that cosplay doesn't equal acting ability.
"My favourite part was when he got his wand out and shouted it's ""wonka time."""
Meh 🫤
"WONKA sounds a lot like WANKA 
🤣"
mathew and simon ❤
I am looking forward to see the movie. Nice to see Rowan Atkinson in this movie too. However why are you refering also the 1971 movie rather than the book? After all: Roald Dahl was not that pleased with that adaptation.
Please stop the remakes.
"""And this is the story of how Wonka became the cartel himself"""
The cast omg
Looks cool and all but why so many remakes ?
Willy W⚓
"I think they should remake The Little Mermaid. 
It’s been at least two minutes since the last one came out."
this looks amazing. Timothée never disappoints
Look 👀 pretty good!….the trailer reminds me of “Jingle Jangle” which I thoroughly enjoyed.
nice
Why does Hollywood keep re making the same movie over n over n over n over n over?
This has made me excited for this movie.
Garbage
deep fake de-aged Jack Albertson appearing or what?
I hate it already. Will probably watch and then curse myself for not listening to my gut.
"yeah, i'm going to see it.  hugh grant as an oompa-loompa sold it for me."
LOVE
"This looks charming... which is a shame, I  was ready to hate it. 😑"
White savior for a black girl? I can get behind that premise.
This is cute but the original and Johnny Depp version will always have a place in my heart. I can't wait to see this remake.... wow words I never thought I would say. 😂🤗
This looks terrible lmao.
timmy how tf am i supposed to wait until decemeber
So is this the prequel to Depp’s or Wilder’s Willy Wonka character? The beginning music through me off with Wilder’s song.
So is Timothy Chalamee (spelling?) The neww Johnny Depp? 😂
“NOW CHOP!!!”
Looks stupid and woke
Looks terrible 😂
I know what happens. It turns out that the young black lady invented everything. And the white Willy Wonka stole it. He’s a bad Willy Wonka and she comes in to save the World.
They’re making another one……
Wonder how many kids wanka is going to k*ll in this one?
*dark? white? nutty? absolutely insane?*
"Sorry Wonka, Oompa Loompa stole your scenes."
PLEASE
Is it just me or does something feel off….? Like they are trying to make it “magical” and special and it just feels forced. Timothy doesn’t seem super authentic to me
This look more magical and original than the last flicks Disney has been releasing
How'd they turn Willy Wonka British but without British actors?
I smell another box-office flop for WB👃
I hope they have pure imagination
Reboot Fatigue
Disaster in the making…
Johnny deep is really a legend to play this role…
???
"I cant tell if the comments about Paddington are joking or if its actually unironically really good, I did go to see Paddington at the cinema around Christmas in 2014 but I don't remember much about it."
"I can guess the credit scene of this movie, either he meet the peoples that got the tickets, or meet his dad"
"0:22
what"
"Paul King, Joby Talbot, Neil Hannon and Timothée Chalamet being involved give me some hope. But it doesn't look like it has any of the edge of the Gene Wilder movie - replaced it with yet more CGI, apparently."
I have such mixed feelings about this.
"Severely unpopular opinion, but this doesn't look too great. Wonka was eccentric, zany, random and witty in the '71 version. Being younger, I expected even more of that here but this personality seems dull compared to Wilder's or Depp's versions. Maybe the trailer doesn't showcase that and hopefully I'm wrong."
"Now this just looks like a nice wholesome good movie. No wokeness, no hidden agenda. I'm really looking forward to this"
This is going to be fun to watch
"To be honest, I'm surprised no one has ever considered making Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, the lesser known sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory into a film."
This looks really bad tbh
"What a sight, Mr Bean.1:41"
"Judging by the looks of that Oompa Loompa in that jar, I could see that they're sticking more with the 1970's version of Willy Wonka. But I ain't complaining, this looks promising"
i love timothee but idk abt this one guyss
2023 is the year random stuff like this can (and most likely will) be big hits
I remember when everyone had doubts about this and was wondering why were we getting it? This trailer is so damn good and I had no idea it was from the person behind Paddington! Can’t wait to see this
The set looks similar to fantastic beast
Almost makes you forget Wonka becomes a reclusive shut in to protect his recipes
All I see is regulus black as Willy Wonka-
Omg I remember seeing Timmy in his Wonka outfit when photos of the movie being shot were out back in 2021 or something and now it’s finally here!
Tim is giving off major Daniel Thrasher vibes and I love it!
Why so many black people?
A prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻
No. Just no.
Wtf is being called something of a magician?? 😂
"This actually looks good
But ofc no one will beat Johnny and especially not Gene

“Scratch that! Reverse it!”
*Someone better give Gene his royalities*"
"""If you wanna view paradise"" I have to see this"
"Looks fun, Johnny ate the whole role with no cumbs left left, though."
The original with Gene wilder will always be the best. But I am intrigued.
at least it’s not another remake.
It’s gonna Flop i guarantee.
Okay you won me over... Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa!? Finally some creativity from Hollywood!
That mfer grandpa joe better not be in this
"“No daydreaming, penalty $3” that actually made me laugh😂 Lmaooo imagine if we had to pay money every time we daydreamed. I’d be out of every last penny of mine"
Already a better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp
Ok im excited AF 😊
Not a fan of horror movies but this looks good
This looks dreadful.
"Idk. This doesn't look like what i hoping for. Kinda looks cheesy. Wonka is a cool character that gotta do him justice, it literally looks exactly like Paddington bear and i don't think that matches Wonka's Character."
I saw Mr.Bean and I am sold
Looks like 💩
Looks delicious and I hope it will not disappoint as whole chocolate in the theaters.
Noooo I prefer the Tim burton lore of Willy wonks
More hot garbage
starting to regret watching the trailer. now I have to wait HALF A YEAR for this
Pretty sure every positive comment with an emoticon at the end is a bot
So I guess Hollywood's been afraid of fresh ideas for decades...
The title of the trailer had me thinking this was going to be a complete wasted addition to Wonka movies. An origin movie that looks like this with this cast and this production team actually looks like it could be a great addition. Looking forward to it.
I don't why but 0:19 to 0:23 has me dying 😂I don't think I've seen Timothée with a role like this
HARD WONKIN' PASS
I was sceptical at first but this actualy looks good and it's from the one that made paddington so it has ti be great
look good and make you goosebumps
"This trailer gives me strong Dolittle vibes, and I hope they're wrong."
MR BEAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE???😂
I just know that one TikTok Wonka hella salty he didn’t get this role 😂
Diversity ✅ Zoomer Tiktoker lead role ✅ Mostly CGI ✅ 2023 Movie ✅
It has the look of Oliver Twist. Not too shabby and curious to see this interpretation of Willy Wonka given it's meant to be a prequel.
"What a legendary cast! When you see Matthew Baynton from Horrible Histories, you know this movie’s going to be a classic."
"Man, this young Wonka definitely channels Gene's Wonka very well. Definitely looking forward to this movie."
Looking forward to it !
Love the American accent for this british film
"looking GREAT , feeling EXCITED for this movie"
Why do I keep seeing Daniel Thrasher instead of Timothee Chalamet lmfao
"2023 filmmaking has taken a step in the right direction- films were originally so dark, but now the darkness has been taken away and light and high definition has been restored! This film looks great, and casting Timothee Chalamet and Keegan Michael Key ensure this film will be good, as they are great improvisers"
"Oompa Loompa Doompa Di Do. Here is the Wonka trailer for you.
Oompa Loompa Doompa Di Date.
Well, I must say this movie looks great"
Mr. BEEEAAAANNN
damn they showed too much
OMG the dancing at the end makes me wanna see the movie XD
"oh god, i hope 'hover choc' is the worst name they have come up with......."
I spent the last 7 years deleting my history
Seems very disney-fied. 😅
"Ahhh me emociona tanto, nunca me he perdido ninguna participación de Timi 💌❤"
This is gonna suuuuuuuk!!!!
I hope they do a charlie and the chocolate factory afterwards
This cast is incredible 😮
Who is the girl supposed to be?? The ending was the best part.
"53 years later, still making movies with this idea. Incredible."
forced racial integration kind of ruins the story.
"I was just about to say, why another Wonka movie. But this looks like so much fun."
"Hugh Grant looks great in it.  Other than that, not needed.  Pass."
No daydreaming??? I must be in North Korea.
can't wait!!!
I’m no really feeling Tim as Willy…
No thanks
seriously? we already had an adaptation that wasn't long ago
Looks terrible in 5 seconds
Clearly a lot of social engineering in the casting tick boxes……
"Bit apprehensive about the girlboss sidekick attached to his hip, but willing to give it a shot if the director of Paddington is behind it"
It’s Matt from horrible histories 😆😆😆
I’m in 100% ❤️
Can we stop ruining movies
Isn't there a movie coming out too about the back story of Augustus Gloop? An English comedian named Wang says he will be in it.
Ah an add on to the horror movie Charlie and the chocolate factory
Beats the other remake. 🤔
لي متى بيحلبون الأفلام...
This looks like an SNL skit. Wow
"The trailer had me 5 seconds in, lost me around a minute in, and brought me back at 2:07. This could either be really good or really bad due to craming in too many plot points"
Where is johnny depp?
Yes sir!
So excited to hear the Umpa Loompa song!!
Ruined it completely
"Y'know, when I first heard about this movie, I'll admit I rolled my eyes, but after seeing this trailer, I might give it a shot."
Kind of getting tired of all these movies from every studio just being repeats with some tweaks. Is it too much to ask for original ideas?
So PC......😥
"Still not grasping it. They made willy the good guy. I guess they haven't read either of the books. He's anything but a good guy. 
Still it's nice to see they woked up the biggest slave owner in kids literature. That's always something"
"Let me guess, he’s been reimagined to be a polyseccual 2 Spirit Otherkin to appeal to “modern audiences.“"
Johnny Depp best Willy wonka
"ii was about to say, oh boy here we go again, another reboot, of the book, but this, this just blew me away, i gotta see this, it looks awesome, and mr bean is in it lol."
"Lowkey missed Johnny Depp. Still, the movie would be amazing.... just a little part still misses the old Wonka."
MR.BEAN!!!😂😂😂
I'm guessing this takes place in Austria Hungary?
For the love of god can we start getting original ideas again ugh
Spoiler the kid got fired and the ommpa loompa takes everyones job lol
I'M SEATED❤
Idk a large part of what made the OG Wonka so appealing is the mystique behind him. You never knew what he was capable of and maybe an origin story isn’t the best. Hoping wrong though 🤷‍♂️
Putting this on my Christmas list. :D
"Okay, sounds fun"
"Omg
This looks horrible. 
Sorry.
I watched the trailer twice. 😢"
This looks just as bad as the last reboot.😢
Timothée Chalamet served a fresh face for the young Wonka but I miss the quirkiness of Johnny Depp's portrayal of the role. And let's talk about Hugh Grant as the Umpa Lumpa? 🤭
Timothee Chalemet is MISCAST. He has no idea how to play this part. It's like he's reading the lines off a teleprompter. His eyes are completely dead. Poor thing. He actually thought he was a real actor......
Who knew 19th century England was full of black people
This looks like trash.
Paused the credits bit and that's a pretty awesome list of UK comedians - it's got to be worth watching.
The setting looks so plain unlike the other story you guys are getting bored like famous people are just good at being famous other people that aren’t famous would make an amazing movie
Looks good 🎥 🎞 🎬
Hmm 🤔
It doesn’t look right a movie based in the early 1900s for blk people to be lead characters in a non struggle movie
"""Here we go, Mama""🥲"
"I was always wondering how a prequel to willy wonka, describing his origin, would be like. Now, after seeing this, I am fully onboard now. This looks absolutely amazing. Can't wait to see this in theaters."
"It’s always mysterious to me how remakes are decided. And, if im not just imagining it, it seems like the influence of Harry Potter, the series set design and FX has spread widely in the industry."
Eu esperei tantos anos para ter 2 filme
"i didn´t cared about the movie when it was announced, but it has peaked my curiosity"
Chalomet seems completely out of place. He looks like there’s an actual eccentric person on set and he’s just copying them.
I will watch this purely for Hugh grant as an oompa loompa.
"It was only a matter of time. Im not dissapointed, im happy its about his story and not a remake."
I was about to downvote and flame this movie for not having Oompa Loompas... but they redeemed themselves.
Looks fun!
A prequel 🤔🤔🤔
Finally an Oompa Loompa that looks like an Oompa Loompa
THIS LOOKS SO EPIC
"If we get a nod to the Weasley/Wonka theory, I’m in!"
"They just put him in because he’s famous , the movie seems so sarcastic and who’s the black girl with him like what the story’s don’t match this just seems so random ☠️"
Who up wonkin they willy right now?
Props to them for paying tribute to the real “Wonka” and not the Johnny Depp atrocity!
L re-re-make
As long as Depp isnt in it....I'm happy.
"Please not another one. I am so sick of all the sequels and spin-offs. I swear that if there were 15 big budget movies for the year 2023, 13 of them are spin offs and sequels. 🤢🤢🤮🤮🤮"
I would watch this just to see Hugh Grant as a dancing oompa loompa.
This looks so good! Def a masterpiece
Tim 😂😂😂
Mathew Baynton! MATHEW BAYNTON!
Stop ruining our childhood!
I never thought I'd see an Oompa Loompa cast as Hugh Grant striking a stripper pose 😂😂.
Can we just stop this
Did they need to cgi the oompa Lompas? Couldn't thet get actual little people?
What I've been waiting for. 😄
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is worth the ticket price alone!
Cool.
I loved the part where he said: It's Wonka time!! 😎
Rowan Atkinson is Back!
"the first one was made in 1971, and the second one was made in 2005, but this one is coming soon in this year 2023. ant thats all i have to say now"
IM LITERALLY CRYING RN
"worst casting for wonka, he is a terrible actor"
"Ngl, Tim doesn't strike me as a Willy Wonka, I don't think he's suited to play wacky, children characters. 
His face compliments a more serious character with a more serious movie tone.

It's like, imagine Keanu Reeves or Christian Bale or Robert De Niro acting in a PG movie, imagine Keanu Reeves as Willy Wonka lmaoo"
Boring
Wow. A film that is actually original and not just a remake.
Another unnecessary revamp. No thanks.
"In terms of remakes, Willy Wonka is the Spiderman of the candy-making cinematic universe."
Damn wanted to see the golden ticket remake.
"I,m see Mr Bean 😂😂"
Oh! When I saw who his mother was I burst into tears. How lovely!
All im thinking about is dune
"wait, wait, wait... is it a prequel to the 1971 movie?
:O"
Can’t wait let’s go ❤😂🎉😢😮😅
"Timothee Chalametwas Edward’s son Edgar and now he is Willy wonka, I would like to see him work together with Johnny Depp and tim burton"
"I'm actually interested, mostly because of Timothy Chalamet I think he will bring a lot to this movie."
I am beyond excited for this I can't wait
He's no Gene Wilder.
Can’t wait 💕
Olivia and Sally ❤
Too much Spice in this kid's head.
Looking forward to seeing Timothee Chalamet performance as Willy Wonka hopefully he will better than Johnny Deep as Deep was awful
"No Depp, no me."
LMAOO IM IN FOR HUGH OOMPALOOMPA AND MR BEAN PRIEST!
Thank you for uploading this trailer in 4K and with subtitles! I hope to see more movie companies do the same.
The chocolate cartel 💀
"Timothee Chalamet, but with Daniel Thrasher energy. This’ll be… interesting."
Parecia uma boa ideia...
more ✡️s in hollywood please!! Theres not nearly enough nepotism!!
Please tell me this means they’ll bring back Wonka’s candies to promote the movie!
It’s giving me Greatest Showman vibes and I’m here for it!!
Please god no more remakes/ universes/ IP squeezes. We are tired. so very tired.
People aren’t hating this as much as I thought they would.
Yep i’m definitely watching this been a fan since i was little can already tell this is gonna be incredible
definitely  wonkin his willy
Evil cannot create
"""too late ive started dancing now"" hahahha"
this seems like it was made by a 13 year old girl who never saw her dad one day in her life.
Waiting for Napoleon and Dune part 2
somebody hook up a turbine to Gene Wilder so we can harness all that energy...
Timothy seems too normal for Wonka
Bruh I thought they will cast Wonka as Black
"Even the trailer is bad quality... I think Warner should fire all his staff and re-hire, it is trash after trash project. "
And the story of OSHA violations begins...
"Given how far Roald Dahl went to protest the source movie, he would definitely despise this no matter what, even if it is successful regardless."
I know this will be amazing bc Timmy is acting in this.
The cocoa mist flow.
Charlie's factory type
That's Christmas entertainment sorted 🎉
Never thought I would hear the words Chocolate and Cartel in the same sentence
Wow this looks terrible
Wonkar the white chocolate factory
Hard core mixed feelings!
LETS GO!!!!!!! My childhood is back!
Wait did I just saw MR BEAN????!!!!
I’m so excited bc Timothée Chalamet is acting as wonka
OF COURSE his daughter is black...😂
So when does he start killing kids like in the Gene Wilder version?
This just made me smile! Another version of Willy Wonka for this newer generation but also a sense of nostalgia for the older generations ☺️👏🏾
DUNE 2 LOOKS INSANE?!?!??!
Why?
Im so excited to watch Willy Wonka vs The Chocolate CARTEL.
"Lots of good actors, but this looks terrible. Boring. Why do they keep remaking this story?"
Looks like Willy Wonka is getting played pretty straight unlike both Gene and Jonnie's version which will be a mistake
Again?
There is only one Willy Wonka - Mr Johnny Depp 😎
Johnny Depp is still the greatest.
Feel like the trailer is super spoilery
this is gonna be meme fuel
I don't understand why people are so mad at this. Wonka 2023 is a prequel from Wilder's Willy Wonka. Leave Timothée alone.
No.
this one looks like it makes up for the WHAT did we just watch dahl's approved version of charlie and the chocolate factory. and yes i am also a fan of the original more. THIS made my holiday list
"This would be great, except it doesn't capture the tone the other two had - Willy Wonka was not this likable from what I remember...quite scary, in fact."
"I’m actually super excited about this, I love The OG Willy Wonka movie so I hope this one does well"
SERIOUSLY???????? WRITE SOMETHING NEW WITH NEW CHARACTERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! AND PAY YOUR DAMN WRITERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I can't wait to see this movie
goddamnit i was really hoping it would have been like an adult version of wonka ughhhhhhhh defs not watching this
"From ""when you say nothing at all"" to oompa loompa what the fudge? HAHAHA #HughGrant"
The actor as Willy Wonka was bad choice. And again....too woke. This is another flop for the studios.
The way i SCREAMED when I saw Matthew Baynton
Make a new movie!!!! FFS
a willy wonka origin story just summarizes everything wrong with movies these days
im not sold. im honestly not sure ill watch it at the moment. im so tired of people just making big budget fanfiction. give me something NEW.
I'm sorry to be a downer but do we really need another Willy Wonka movie
"This could be great knowing it's being made by the director of Paddington, but giving Willa Wonka a strong American accent is and will always be a cardinal sin"
put johnny depp as the father watch the box office go boom
WAS THAT MR.BEAN?!?!?!
Did I just saw Mr. Bean and the guy from Paddington?? Yep im in. 😂
"Uhh Willy Wonka is characterised as an eccentric madman isolated from society in his alien wonderland for years pursuing the ultimate feats of confectionary and childlike wonder, to the point that to outsiders he becomes deeply unsettling with an almost dangerous lack of social skills. This... doesn't look like any of that. This looks like ""lol I'm insane, want some chocolate?"". Not looking forward to this at all."
So Chocolate (the movie) meets The Greatest Showman
"Omg the cast! I love Paddington and all those actors are some of my favorites! If this is as wholesome and fun as the paddington movies, then this will be a big success!"
"For anyone interested. The real Willie Wonka was a gunner in a b-17 in world War 2. Willard J. ""Willie"" Wonka. I'm a Wonka myself. Hes my great great uncle. We know the writer of Willy Wonka was in the British air force. It's quite the coincidence. When the original movie came out Willard passed candy out at schools and our family used to get calls all the time because people saw Wonka in the yellow pages lol."
Wonka makes candy. 🍬 🍭 🍫 🥰
Lmao this is gonna be terrible
Magnifique! 🤩
"« Too late, I’ve started dancing now. Once we started, we can’t stop »😭 I can’t wait to see this movie!!"
Thank you for not blackwashing the film ❤️
Again?
Looks like Muad'Dib got too much spice last night...
"I’m gonna say something unrelated 














Milk"
Oh look its another remake 😮.......do writers/producers even have any original ideas these days?   I guess its easier to just keep milking those popular cash cows.
Looks like a fun movie. The Oompa Loompa scene tho😂😂😂😂
Perfect WONKA!
Marauders editors are going to go wild with this new material
Imagine Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka.
This guy doesnt have the charm of the guy in the original wonka movie😕 he just looks like a highschool boy. And why was there so scene of the chocolate factory in the trailor? 🥲 looks like a totally different movie!
"I can't wait!! I was a little skeptical at first, but I think I'm going to like it. ☺ We need something uplifting and magical again."
"Really great month for movies! Wonka, Godzilla Minus One, and Aquaman"
this has a completely different feel than with Johnny Depp but I'm excited
"This movie looks wonderful! But I do think he was miscast or needed a voice coach if not, none of these whimsical lines sound authentic with his delivery :T He looks the part enough but his voice is so corny and too modern"
Sally Hawkins was amazing in 'Spencer' I'm so excited that she's in this!
Timothy already looks like an absolute failure of the character. He's not goofy or cynical enough to play Wonka. Can't wait to see this flop harder than Neymar.
"Hmmm, could be worth seeing. More origin tale with a touch of rewrite rather than the Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp trying to find an heir versions. The scenery is definitely up there on quality."
so willie wonka is a small businessman challenging a dystopian corporate monopoly to eventually become a chocolate magnate himself
Looks good but not great . Looks very comedic and goofy and I kinda wanted more dramatic. More of a darker tone for a backstory. But I’ll give it a try.
this looks appallingly bad
This looks like a wholesome masterpiece. I hope it’s just as good as the trailer suggests :)!
why don't his lips sync
This movie looks stupid
Hopefully not as insane as the Johnny Depp version
This movie looks stupid
"Doesn't seem like an unpredictable, obsessed, chocolatier to me."
This movie looks stupid
😂😂😂 wtf is this?!!?
CANT WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
No
This movie looks stupid
Horrible casting. Love Timothee in other roles. This? What a mess
Why does this need to exist.
"Just realized how great jhonny , been missed."
I'm not buying him as Wonka at all.
Paul wake up stop trippin on melange we got a universe to burn
"Timothee Chalamet
Keegan-Michael Key
Sally Hawkins
Olivia Colman
Rowan Atkinson
Jim Carter
Hugh Grant

What are the odds?!"
"No new ideas, check."
"Oh look, another pass"
Can't wait for Twitter to blow tf up and think J.K. Rowling is making money off this movie 💀
No one can beat Johny Depp _  as Willy Wonka 🍫
Nawww Mathew Baynton from Horrible Histories is in this let’s gooooo 😭😭😭😭
Wth is this 😐
Art direction and costume Oscars in the bag
"I’m so happy to see Mr Carson again, the rest of trailer seems to be OK"
Can’t wait to see it.
It seems like he's doing a johnny depp impression when he should be doing a gene wilder impression.
Omg - can anyone create their own stories anymore? Rehash bull .
"Let’s give it up for Hollywood. Shamelessly remaking every classic into their own vision full of their own messages. We are entering the dark ages of our time. Creativity is dwindling, the rich are tirelessly feeding on our weakness and providing foundations for their children. We will find our own end sooner than we think. Wake up."
Im not sure he was the right one for this part. Something is way off
Sure
This young actor is not selling it
FIGURES THEY GOTTA GO A CHANGE EVERYTHING AND RUEING OUR CHILDHOODS JUST LIKE LITTLE MERMAID #CANCELWONKA
lol so random … … …
"When I saw this pop up, I was very skeptical.  Now that I watched it, I’m actually very curious about it."
"Gene did great in the first movie 
Johnny great in the remake 
Do we need this?"
"This looks dumb a f, and I like the Willy Wonka movies."
Not for me but you guys do you
oompa :) loompa :) origin :) story :)
“I spent the last 7 years” says the NEPO Baby
Nah sick of the forced inclusion. EZ pass.
Rhino Stew is going to have a field day trying to continue his Snowpiercer theory after this 😂
Yeah it's a nah from me...
Why would you use the term cartel and chocolate together in a movie of Willy Wonka 😂
😂😂😂😂 boooooooo
Why tho
Looks like another Willy W with too much CGI
Me two minutes into the video: BUT WHERE ARE THE OOMPA LOOMPAS? OH there they are there they are
him not having the british accent is severely throwing me off
"Looks horrible, too much CGI; especially the oopa you can tell the effects are poorly designed 🤣"
I’d rather stick to the Johnny depp version
I thought they said this guy is a good actor? He's doing theater acting
Oh this is an origin story?
Geeeezzzz ... ALREADY ANOTHER ......KINDA HARD TO UPSTAGE GENE OR JOHNNY .....I WONT WASTE MY TIME ON IT
Love how Shabnam from EE is killing it with these supporting roles!
to be honest...........they should have never remade it with Johnny depp...........i really donrt need a 3rd wonka movie
the Closed Caption at 0:01 got be dead bruh
жопка класс
"I don't care for this


Yet my son and daughter will so

4 tickets please"
Woke as expected.
Omg I'm so ready!!
This looks so cute i wish they would do more prequels instead of all these remakes and sequels
oh boy another friggin remake
Yikes.  Surprised Wonka isn't black honestly.
Looks wholesome...*eyes narrow* TOO wholesome.
It’s Alan Johnson!
"Won’t be the same without Johnny, feel like Willy Wonka will not give off his signature vibe"
1:07 *”Is that……normal chocolate you’re making? It doesn’t look normal”.* 🤨🤨🤨🤨🤨
"The seems like it would make more sense as a sequel, than a prequel."
Imagine casting white bread as fizzy lifting drink 😒
This better have a sad ending with the chocolate cartel stealing his recipes and him closing down the factory locking himself with the umpas so there’ll be a part two
Wow. This looks incredible and exciting.
I didn't think the remakes could get worse. We were very content with the jonny depp version.
Dune: The Prequel
Timothee fits the character so much
Woker
Why didn't they use Johnny Depp to play the role ?
"He doesn’t look like he fits the role. He’s a terrific actor, but he’s forcing the performance."
Whoa!! Lil Mabu looks great as the young Willy Wonka!🎉🎉
More woke nonsense! Go woke go broke!
So many black but no asian and latino. We need diversity
"The Ommpa Loopa tastes like Ommpa Loopas. The snozberries tastes like snozberries. Hugh Grant as a Ommpa Loopa,hahaha."
Pass
Cute and British 😂❤
Keegan 😂😂😂😂
"This is one of the reasons why the reasoning of ""why are they even making this"" can be right or wrong.
A lot of beloved movies, roles, and remakes were lambasted before they even released footage.
Carpenter's The Thing, Ledger's Joker, Battlestar Galactica."
"Not my first choice of actor for Willy Wonka, great actor but the trailer he comes across as a predictable American with little character.."
This looks surprisingly good
"Bit weird! A young Wanka! Forced! Unnatural! Weird! Well...not for me! Am sure it will have an audience, just not me!"
this looks so soulless
Kind of wish they let Wes Anderson do this but I’m very excited for another Paul king film.
"Tbh chalamet acting doesnt look the best, but if its made by Paul King, the guy who made paddington this is for sure a banger"
This looks like absolute garbage.
They forced once again a black girl to be a supporting actress 🤡🤡🤡
"I love that this is taking inspiration from every source. The books, the movies, even a bit of the musical thrown in there"
We can’t come up with anything original! 🎉
"Disney and Hollywood = Evil!!!
Hollywood and Celebritys = İlluminati's Puppets!!!
In Hollywood, many stars use Adrenochrome!!!
Mel Gibson has spoken directly on the subject:
I don’t know how to break it to you gently.… 
Hollywood is institutionalized pedophilia.
They are using and abusing kids.
They churn through a huge amount of kids every year. 
Their spiritual beliefs, if you can call them that, direct them to harvest the energy of the kids. 
They feast on this stuff and they thrive on it.
What do I mean? This isn’t some kind of artistic abstraction. 
They harvest the blood of children. They eat their flesh. 
They believe this gives them life force.
If the child was suffering in body and psyche before it died, they believe this gives them extra life force.
There is a creative and loving force inside most of us that guides us through life. 
These people don’t have this. For them it’s the opposite.
Hollywood is drenched in the blood of innocent children. 
For a long time all the references to pedophilia and cannibalism were symbolic or allusive. 
But I was personally introduced to the practice in the early 2000s.
I can talk about this now because these people, the execs, they’re dead now.
The blood of a sexually abused infant is considered highly ‘enriched’ and is highly prized!!!"
"If we're lucky, it will be a hit. Then same cast can do a better Chocolate Factory, than... He who must not be named."
"Let's be very fair here.....
I can't.... here take my damn money"
Keegan Michael key.... absolutely yes.
Oof.
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE BEFORE THE BEST PREQUEL OF 1971. 🍫
Beautiful trailer. I feel like I’m in another world entirely
Epic
boring 😂😂😂😂
Hugh grant as a oompa loompas. This film has lost it and i want to get lost with it too!
"ANOTHER remake???? OMG come on man, quit beating dying horses.   get a new Idea !!!!"
This gives me Dolittle vibes
OF COURSE HE HAS A BLACK SIDEKICK!
"I really like the energy this has, and I already like Wonka's bond with the girl, it's cute and seems like a little found family between the two."
This is giving Wes Anderson vibes!! I love it
"This is so disrespectful to Roald Dahl, it should be a prequel to the books, not the film"
This looks good but y
"Looks terrible, I absolutely can’t wait"
This Snow Piercer Prequel is gonna be wild
Looks great but some dialogues are a bit cringy but overall the movie looks good
"I might check out this film still.  It retains a bit of its auspiciousness.  However, I am rather disappointed that it is an origin story to the 1971 adaptation of Roald Dahl's classic book.  It would have been lovely to see an origin story to the original Mr. Wonka."
Terrible
LMAOOOOOOO cringey.
"Damn, I don't remember this Dune book"
goosebumps!!
"this might as well exist, sure"
not what i expected… in a bad way.
"""hey warner, do you want make  another remake of Willy Wonka after the glorious Johnny Depp movie?""

""Sure but i want one condition""

""tell me""

""put in a black""

""warner, it's implicit"""
🍫
"BERRIES AND CREAM, BERRIES AND CREAM, I'M A LITTLE LAD WHO LOVES BERRIES AND CREEEEAM"
WASHING
Hugh Grant playing Lord Farquaad
Is it just be or Timothy not giving me wonka? Idk Depp ruined me
"""... and the producer of Harry Potter""

No wonder they dress like that particular fashion"
"Getting mixed vibes, on one hand it looks good, on the other, I see no mention of an alternate universe. :/"
Apparently this Wonka likes his chocolate dark.
Did someone forget to tell Keegan that this is set in London and not Brooklyn?
Timothée is the best choice to play this role
I'm happy Timothy gets to play Willy Wonka 😅the movie looks interesting can't wait for it to come out 😅😅
"""From the Director of Paddington""
If my wallet could speak, it would for this."
"mmmm, hard pass."
"Too woke, pass"
uhhh
God this looks like trash.
This actually looks really good!
IS THAT MATTHEW BAYNTON???
just wrecked a classic once again
Just name the movie Willy already
It's nice to see a movie filled with whimsy instead of being laden with woke!
"0_0
………"
terrible movie
ROWAN ATKINSON!!!! ROWAN ATKINSON!!!!
Chalamet slowly becoming the next gen Johnny Depp.
its has to be good right? cause paddington is a cinematic masterpiece.
"Considering the last remake costs a lot to make, I am curious how much this one costs in comparison."
where it's the faxtory ?
Just take my money
"This film has a lot to live up too..
Gene Wilder made this character into a Legend.
Are we going to see another train wreck ? Only time will tell.."
MATHEW BAYNTONNNNNNNNN
Another woke diverse load of garbage.
Woke wonka and the chocolate faces.
"Sad, looks like a movie made just for kids.  The other Willy Wonka movies are very much… good no matter what age you are.  This isn’t what I thought it would be"
CANT WAIT!!!
With how fascinating Willy Wonka's backstory was in the movie I'm surprised it's taken 50 years to make a movie about it. Very much looking forward to seeing this!
nope
So just by looking at the oompa loompas they are using Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka so I'm guessing this is a setting before the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory
Looks woke
That is a new one coming out. Oh my God I watched both of the other ones and I like it so I hope this one is really good all the other ones.
oh no...
omg i am so excited for this
So basically willy wonka is a chocolate mage
Soooo…. When did he become insane. Cause this guy just seems happy af.
But he can't be releasing magic flying chocolates into the world yet. It isn't until he's older that he invents the Fizzy Lifting Drink which does that exact same thing! And nobody is familiar with it when it's shown!
Chalamet is so wooden.
This timm cham guy picking crappy movies
"Sorry, I don't believe it, I cannot get lost in the story, it is too woke, black side characters (historically they were not in that position), single mom, neoliberalism, and more. The only good thing is Hugh Grant. It is not hate, I know is sci fic but the credibility comes with historical references, it is not credible. And Black characters are always side characters, they are never the main one, this is too woke."
.......i lke this umpa lumpa :)
Bro Charlie and the chocolate factory changed the whole world
Hope its nothing like Tim Burton's adaptation
"Seems like a better version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, but a prequel"
"i wasnt feeling it the whole time, but this cast is stacked af. really excited now! hopefully we see a cameo from the original Charlie actor"
I want to see a sequel to this and I never even seen it yet
We were expecting Johnny Depp to be willy Wonka 😢😢
I hope you for this movie comes out they might announce they’ll do a Looney Tunes short film. But this time for someone else who deserves it.
"Take me, Johnson. I'm yours!"
Third times a charm...
Hershey's Kisses killed you.
"This doesn't feel like a real movie. That's not necessarily a good or bad thing, just a statement."
He spent 7 years traveling the world while looking like he's 17?! Ya lost me 😂
TIMMY
"Gene Wilder had his own flair for this character.
Johnny Depp had his own flair for this character.

This kid has no flair.  He's just..............there.
Stealing all of Gene Wilders character bits, music, and more!!!  What an ABOMINATION!!!!

This would have been fine for a kids film, but it is NOT worthy to carry the name WONKA!!!!"
"If you're reading this comment, salute to you bro 💯 i hope you win in life!"
Woah
"The fact that it's written and directed by Paul King, I'm really excited for the movie"
"It’s all fun and games until someone hates the the movie and I don’t like that  

P.S Warner bros is my number 1 favorite company but I don’t like David Zaslav 😡"
Looks good but as good of an actor as Timothee is this feels like a bad casting
*Phir Se Wonka!* 🤦🏽🤦🏽‍♂️
'Every good thing in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours.'
Thought this was another remake but kinda interesting seeing the origins
Ooh this looks promising
This prequel to Snowpiercer looks pretty legit.
This will be a great holiday movie
OK this looks like a prequel more than a third reboot. Since everybody loves the original.
Can’t wait for Timothy Chevrolet to ruin another thing
The prequel I never knew I needed and never thought I would get emotional watching at the end with Wonkas Mothers. HERE WE GO MOMMA.......chills!
Looks positively missable.
This looks surprisingly good!
Everything about this is already heading in the right direction toward greatness!
Can’t wait for Wonka to change his name to Wilford and start building a train in the season finale
hm..
This movie seems ok i still like the others better than this one
ugh couldn't they get a Brit or teach Timothy an RP accent
This looks really boring
this looks like a good but i dont with the whole writters strike has had effected movies poorely so i dont if we be as great as creed III and across the spider verse
I love a twink Wonka
Nah this looks bad already it could’ve been good without the magical stuff

Blackwashing again
Loving the new take
Absolute Cinema.
Lovely production BUT Those Are Some BIG Shoes To Fill???  Should do well but not spectacular!   Anyone reading this DID YOU KNOW THE FIRST WILLY WONKA BOMBED AT THE BOX-OFFICE???  I think a full on Musical would have been the better way to go!
Franco looked more believable as Oz than whatever Chalamet is trying to do here.
What a wonderful movie for the holidays! Timothee' dancing and singing: YES
Anyone wonking they willy rn?
Willy Wonka Willy Wonka Willy Wonka
"Translate. ❤
ฉันจะสมัครรับข้อมูลใครก็ตามที่สมัครรับข้อมูลฉันและชอบความคิดเห็นนี้"
But he is no Jhonny Depp
"Nah this ain't it. The secret ingredient to Willy Wonka is insanity, not whimsy 😂"
Wonder what the girl's role is in this movie. She feels a bit random.
"So far, I'm not that big on Timothee Chalamet as Wonka, and think that Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp FAR surpass him from what was shown in this trailer, but I'm definitely watching this for Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, and Keegan Michael Key."
Money grab plain and simple. Besides everyone knows there are no non-whites in Wonka Land 😂
🤦🏻‍♂️ why
it’s kinda giving harry potter vibes and i’m so here for it
jewish psyop the movie
This looks so incredible - I can't wait!!!!
You can really tell the academy's rules of films needing atleast 3 token black people includes this film. The whole vibe just seems......boring
seems like the girl character is a forced diversity hire when will they learn to not do these sheningans add characters where necessary and make sense though  wonka only works with ullalammpa's
"Ok, Paul Atriedes. You had too much of those spice stuff..."
This looks like a tumblr fan fiction's fever dream.
oh come on....
The kid playing Willy Wonka is super cringe and weird looking
It’s already good
"Brad Williams implied something about the dwarfism community being upset about Hugh Grant. Is that true, or was he just joking?"
"What would make this top tier, is if theres clue for snowpiecer"
Did this film really need to be made? Is Hollywood so bankrupt for ideas that they have to capitalize on the 1971 classic again!?
No one asked for this !!!!
😐
This made me smile ! I love movies that tap into my childhood
This movie will flop.
Delightful.
I'd watch this.
Willy Wonka got kicked out of Hogwarts and is now making chocolates
"Like the original ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"", it seems to give me the munchies for chocolate...🍫"
"I was a little on the fence about this at first but, now I’m intrigued"
This looks terrible!
Its not really doin it for me. Gene Simmons is the one for me
Back in my day you got traumatized by gene wilder in Willie Wonka movies whippersnapper
hmmm idk :/
finally
Absolutely not
1:42 Mr.Bean 😂
OMG! 😍
Good for Christmas !
Looks a bit cheeks if we’re being honest
Awalnya gak tertarik nonton tp gua jd mau nonton ini krn ada mr.beannya jd cameo
"This really looks awful, just awful."
oh my… is it just me or is wonka looking mighty fine this afternoon…
"Finally a movie that looks like a  classic without any woke agenda, no lgbtq, no making wonka the race he isnt, etc... just good old plain fun! Im excited for it"
"Okay you got me with ""from the director of Paddington."""
Looks absolutely terrible. Boring actor just another teen heart throb to boost sales gimmick. Surprised they ain't try to add Zendaya. Hugh looks great. Will be a hard pass tho.
I can see Gene Wilder in him
"Hugh Grant sold me... I wasn't sold, and then Hugh Grant came on and I was sold. Dang it!"
"It might be good, but in the back of my head I will know that Roald Dahl will be rolling in his grave over this."
yall too easy to please
Now this looks like a movie I can sink my teeth into. Just like a really good chocolate bar.
Monnezza
This is gonna be HUGE.
omg
"No, just NO. No no please no dont do it. I just feel its a disrespectful act towards the character and everything he ever was"
did anyone else catch The Flash DCEU crossover candy?
Please no
"Come with me and you'll be
In a world of pure imagination!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Another?
Very interesting casting for Wonka. I’ll try to keep an open mind
"at first I was like ""why do we need a prequel"" and now i'm like ""...oh nvm, yeah, we need this"""
Why is Willy Wonka suddenly Daniel thrasher? ( He's a youtuber)
"I'm actually looking forward to this movie! Seems fun and sincere, not to mention the cast is absolutely stacked. Seeing Keegan Michael-Kay in the movie also made me damn near jump in my seat."
"Lol. Nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity😂😂"
I mean I like paddington. But do we need this?
"""From the director of Paddington"" you've sold me
""From the producer of Harry Potter"" and you've lost me"
Meh
"and suddenly, i miss Jhonny Deep, and good cgi"
Looks OK. Anything to redeem that world from Tim Burtons ridiculous nonsense. RIP Gene Wilder.
Nope
Chocolate is melanin. Blacks have it. Whites don't.
Make new IP.
Only wish we could have seen Gene Wilder in a prequel of Willy Wonka
Don't eat the peaches that's not cream in them!!!
"I wonder if there will be a sad ending with Wonka being alone, telling all his workers to leave, employing the ompaa lompas and shutting down his factory"
so weird to see mr moseby in movies
"I loved Paddington but I was never a fan of Willy Wonka movies.  Also, Timothy Chamalet as Willy Wonka???? Huh???"
Жопка🥰
Hugh Grant as an umpa lumpa I'm there.
Not going watch this because Johnny Depp is will always be Willy Wonka in my opinion. This not Willy Wonka.
The last thing anyone needed. If you're going to make abominations of classic films please at least have respect for the material.
Why don't all of you pedos take a hint and stop making your garbage and disappear.
Looks like WBD is planning on extending their run of flops into December.
Another one!!!!!
It looks like the manager from Key and Peele's frozen yogurt shop skit has a cousin in law enforcement.
Omggg I can not waitttt!!!!
I’m just here for 1:03! ☺️
tim burtons wonka had daddy issues this one has mommy issues lol
I’m so in love with this
no no no no no no no no
"I can’t help it but compare Johnny Depp’s willy wonka to this one!! And the difference is huge for me!
I don’t what it is but it lacks the magic 🤩🪄"
I am probably the only one who can’t get w this 🥴
Nothing against the actors but... Who asked for this ?
OMG
Why?
MUAD’DIB WHAT ARE YOU DOING!?
This just looks awful!
Is there a reason why they mock the story instead of being serious with the story?
Oompa Loompas need they own film😊
idk how to explain it but timothy chalamet is the most willy wonka name
Rowan Atkinson ❤
Deep Roy will always be my Oompa Loompa.
This just looks like a Mary Poppins movie not a Willy Wonka movie
I really hope Oompa Loompa come as a native Tribe like the original
Doesn’t feel like there’s much of a story here. And I love me some 🍭🍬🍫
Great cast. I'm in.
I'm sorry he's too young. How can I be expected to believe a 16 year old is an expert at anything and an explorer?
This feels like a Man Carrying Thing video.
Timothee as Willy Wonka  Im SO excited
Huh... It's a prequel to the Gene Wilder movie rather than the Burton movie. Wonder how they got the Roald Dahl Estate to agree to that given that author hated the Gene Wilder version.
This looks sick
It’s a origin movie?
0:21 AYO NUTTY 👀👀👀
Seems good.
Chalamet's Willy Wonka looks and sounds like Sheldon Cooper. WB is intent on making no money for the rest of their time as a studio it seems.
"Please stop remaking old classics! Ruining good films for a payday, no thanks"
Very worried but as soon as I saw Paul King as director Im slightly less worried. It might actually be good.
I think this looks like a good movie! I will for sure be seeing it when it is released!!! ❤🍫
This movie 🎥 is going to make the late Gene Wilder happy.
This looks magical and im not even into these types of films.
"Ok this was something I didn't know I wanted, but yeah I want this, I hope to God its good, it looks amazing and nostalgic.  I can't wait for this and during the Christmas season, come one! Well done!"
He who controls the cocoa controls the universe.
Do we really need another remake?
Hear me out. Timothee as Jack Skellington and Jenna Ortega as Sally in NBC live action remake.
roald dahl will be turning in his grave about all this monetising trash  trying to be associated with his amazing works
Another big 200M movie remake/prequel. Can't wait for not watching it!
Ayoo timothee got range 👏
"I'm glad it's inspired by Gene Wilder's Wonka, but I kinda wish Christopher Lee was around to be his disapproving dentist of a father. RIP to both legends"
Looks good will definitely see it in theaters
Interesting Idea... wrong casting
Many years ago it looked like a naïve fantasy. Now it looks like a highly detailed bad trip in 3D combined with a fever dream.
Yessss.
Looks… terrible.
Wanka 😂
for the love of....COME UP WITH ORIGINAL IDEAS
I'll say this some of the jokes in the trailer are quite funny .
It's incredible that it's based on a true story
Ghastly
What a sanitized and vanilla depiction.
just make an original movie ffs.
Why did they remake it? Should have left it alone!
W movie
Wow nod to the original strike it reverse it 👏
I hope this is as good as it looks.
bruh if that guy is playing Willy Wonka i gotta go see it
Never thought I would prefer the Tim Burton film over anything…but then I saw this trailer.
timothy chocolate
Pure Imagination!
Oof
"Looks like a quality piece of confection, indeed!"
I see I'm the only one that thinks this looks like complete trash.
"I got an idea! Lets exploit workers for my benefit! 
Oh cool! Capitalism is wickedddd /s"
"Seeing Timotei Shampoo, Vicky Pollard and Charles the Second in the same trailer is genuinely jarring 😂😂😂"
Seeing Sally Hawkins as Wonka's mom feels so wholesome for some reason.
I never thought my life would be
I came here with low expectations but it surprisingly looks good and heartwarming!
looks ok
man this gets a remake and we can't get a polar express sequel.
So is this a prequel to the original Willy wonka?
Timothy Chalamet really is a great actor. Dune part 2 and Wonka just shows he can do anything!
OMFG 😭
"He who controls the chocolate, controls the universe."
"Not gonna lie, I rolled my eyes when I saw the title thinking it was gonna be another remake but I'll take an origin story.  This is giving Ratatouille vibes mixed with some sort of Christmas vibe movie and I'm here for it."
It actually looks good!!
Ready to see this in Theaters
CHOCOLATE FINGER ME
I really miss these types of wholesome movies Hollywood used to make back then so much and I hope the Wonka movie don't disappoint 😊.
Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me. Nobody did it better. He is and was a genius.
I hope Timothee Chalamet revives what Gene Wilder started and overshadows what Johnny Depp made a dogs dinner of. He's perfectly cast for this role quirky and talented.
I was on the fence until Hugh Grant. I'm in. 🤣
"Oh god, please stop Hollywood"
This looks cute!
Woke Wonka has arrived.
"Only Gene Wilder can play Wonka, no one else will do it justice."
"This looks awful. The ""reverse that"" line made my skin crawl. The over use of CGI has got to go in all movies. Go real or go away."
So tired of remakes. Old version was perfect. Where is WB's originality?
"As long as my favorite Rowan Atkinson is in this movie, I'm not avoiding it"
"I'll be damned..., didn't think that Johnny's version could be topped.  This trailer looks better than that entire movie......,"
"he lacks his lover, the old man, because, i know he likes older than he is"
"How is no one talking about Mathew Baynton and Simon Farnaby, the Horrible Histories actors being in this?"
i knew lil mabu was an industry plant
Same dumb remake. MAKE SOMETHING NEW.
What happened to the creative minds? I’m sick of remakes or prequels & sequels and blah blah blah. Please give us something new 🫠
Pass
Great cast; confused by the script. Hoping for the best.
I believe that Wonka will be perfect film as Carl and chocolate factory☺️
I’ll stick to dune part 2 thanks lol that cgi looks on Disney par 🤣
Amazing movie.❤❤❤❤
Timothee acting happy is off putting
rowan atkinson is in it so i will watch it
Mr. Bean❤
Looks like a wholesome movie
Too many black people
I love the visuals! The scene of the balloons seems ethereal ❤
This looks terrible!
Is he supposed to be a young Gene Wilder?
once again Hugh Grant saves everything he's in.
"Tim Burton's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was HORRIBLE. 
Of course, the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory will always be the best, but I hope this movie is somewhat decent. Honestly, there is no need for another."
This looks awful. Stop making fake backstories.
"Can't wait to see this, especially when it is releasing just a few days before my birthday!!! Yayyy 😊"
"willy wonka origin story. ah, 2023..."
WAIT...........so does this mean ALL the oompa-loompas are Hugh Grant?!?!
i need him
I love the cast of multiple famous British actors 😂
If you really didn’t mumble I probably would understand what you’re saying
Timothée Chalamet is a phenomenal actor. I hope they show a devastated and torn side of him to keep the audience from thinking this is only a whimsical story
This looks amazing! Can’t wait!
"he's a great visual casting, but i feel like his voice doesn't have the grandeur I imagined??"
"This looks, dare I say, magical?"
I’m so glad the Oompa Loompa looks like the ones from the original film. Too bad they didn’t cast a little person though.
The film will hit a pure imagination.
Is this Dune Part II?
🎉🎉 can’t wait to watch this movie
Ммм хуета
This looks like it is going to be a classic
I know garbage when I see it
This is giving me fantastic beasts vibes
"A Movie without Jonny Depp, ist not a good Movie."
😒😒 doesn't look good.
Swaer to god Timothee Chalemet is the next big thing if he keeps playing his cards right
This looks nice
Michael Kors should be Oompa Loompa tho 😂
I remember when the she hulk trailer dropped and we said it looked pretty good.  Not gonna judge until i see it 😂😂😂
i never thought there will be a willy wonka origin story!! 🤣
So he DIDN’T turn kids into Wonka Bars???
"Wasn't really looking forward to this, but the CAST, good lord what a great cast. I'll watch it for that alone."
"i loved Timothée Chalamet in Call Me by Your Name and Beautiful Boy. but i really don’t know how i feel about him playing Willy Wonka, it’s kinda off putting."
"usually i hate reboots and remakes, but this one actually looks great. but of course, we can't judge just by a trailer. i would have to wait for my trusted reviewer to review this movie, whether it is worth it or not."
"Such bad writing. Im so tired of them making a movie people recognize and know they'll come see that they put zero effort into the writing. ""Nithing to see here just people defying gravity?"" Ugh."
So my first thought when I sae this was really another wonka movie? And thought after the last one it was going be trash.....trailer actually looks decent.
"So they're just going to... white wash... the fact that the Oompa Loompas are literally a kidnapped tribe of pygmy slaves from the ""Deepest and Darkest"" reaches of Africa?"
I'm so excited for this film! I love his previous performances
"Well, he's no Gene Wilder.  Seems pretty dull."
They should've brought back Johnny Depp. But oh well
"i love these type of lore movies, always wondered how he became to be.

what other character from other movies yall think need lore movies ?"
I know I’m gonna love this movie it’s Willy wonka!
The original Wonka movie will continue to be the best 
Cannot believe this guy is dating Kylie Jenner
This could be really interesting.
They had me at wooly 😂😂😂
Ill pass
"Christ, and people said ""Solo"" was an unnecessary prequel..."
"If this is going to be a thing, it better be decent at the least"
"If this is how you get people excited for a film, you failed. This looks like more modern trash on beloved IPs."
"Rowan Atkinson's appearance alone is enough to let me know that this movie is gonna be great, and of course our boy Timothy will amaze us with his performance✨️"
"looks exactly like every fantastic beasts movies, and like those modern Marry poppins knockoffs"
"If I ain’t broken, don’t fix it 🙃"
I’m already cringing 0:22
I always had a crush on willy wonka
I remember those old Batman and Star wars fan trailers from years back. Troll fan trailers have really come a long way and become much more elaborate in the recent years. Keep it up you troll rascals
Yay! I have always loved this movie! Can’t wait!
Leave it alone.
He’s gotta be more introverted tho…
Do tickets come with a free Willy Wonking? Otherwise I'mma pass on this.
cringe
Had absolutely no interest in this movie as I was watching the trailer until Hugh Grant showed up all adorable and orange 🥹❤️
I think Jeremy Allen White would have been perfect as wonka. He has a lot Gene Wilder energy.
Why?
"It was losing me but when I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa in the end... you sonnovabisj, I'm in."
i think i deserve this movie
"Seriously...? WHY??? The cinemas are filled to the brim with remakes, sequels and superhero movies. New stuff please!!!"
This looks surprisingly delightful.
"""Woke-a""
Watch it fail"
"A LITTLE CRINGEY, CHALAME SHOULD HAD WAITED A LITTLE MORE FOR THIS ROLE "
"Ye, but will Wonka be Woke?..... 🎉"
UGH this movie has been done to death. Somebody remake chitty chitty bang bang
"I don’t want to love this, but I’m not sure I’m going to be able to stop myself ❤❤❤"
Didn't want to try your luck with Ezra Miller again
This trailer got me more excited this movie than I thought I would be. I can see that they are going more for a johnny depp Wonka backstory rather than a gene wilder Wonka backstory which I love. My only concern is I'm a little afraid the timelines won't match up with this movie and Charlie and the chocolate factory but that's fine
Super woke as usual. They've included the token spunky black girl side kick. I feel sorry for her career. when will the Woken end their ingrained racism?
Why does this look like a Fantastic Beasts movie trailer? Great video tho
Oh this actually looks so good 😭
I feel like....i wanna see this?
We need Carmy from The Bear as Wonka
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
"I love how they mixed up the original score form the older films, that really shows the care put into the film. This is so exciting ❤😊"
Seriously 😂 now we need a black Wonka?!
Didn't know I needed this in my life
Timmy may have the look but he does not have the voice let alone the charisma for Willy Wonka
*Nope.*
Is that you? Daniel thrasher? @danielthrasher🤯
Well I didn’t know I needed another Wonka movie but apparently I do! ❤
"Yeeeahhh, not buying into this."
"Fact that rowan Atkinson is in the movie, now this is a must watch"
Can they please think up new stories to tell I guess not
*Google's* homer Simpson umpalumpa
can't wait!
I was expecting a horror movie but I could deal with this
Seems like an interesting twist on Roald Dahl’s story! Plus...Hugh Grant!! Looks promising!😊
Wonka is gonna be a world of Pure Imagination!
"HUH... I was worried, but, this actually looks like it could be okay. HOPEFULLY it captures the charm of the first one with Mr Wilder, but, looks like there already implentening charactersics from that way :)

Hope its summin wonderul"
This is ridiculous I see straight through the premise.
"This looks cute, glad the Paddington people are making it"
"And you wouldn’t have chocolate without Native Americans who happen to be missing in this entire movie. But we aren’t a large demographic so no need to cater to us, the descendants of the creators of Chocolate, representation isn’t important if it can’t warm the seats inside a theater."
If kids and teens see this it must be a rule they watch the original then the second one first
This will do great in China
I can see how Timothee Chalamet grows into Johnny Depp's version.
And here I thought Mario was going to be the only movie worth seeing this year.
Now _this_ is a movie I can look forward to. Which is more than I can say for many recent and upcoming Disney movies. I wonder if we'll see any of the vicious fauna of Loompaland?
"Has a ""Fantastics Beasts"" feel to it. Not sure if that's good or not."
okay okay... so it's not a super serious movie. Alright I need to change my expectations a little bit.
"Why do we need another version of this film? Seriously at what point do we story rehashing same old stories over n over n over? Im so over it and will not be paying to see this. Hopefully writers strike will weed out new 'diversity""  hire horrid writers and give the creative qualified writers pay they deserve. Then maybe we can get original interesting films again"
y el jony dep ?
snow piercer prequel
*fart*
I'd better get at least one new fetish from watching this movie.
Not sure bout the casting of timothee seems a lil awkward. Everything else is great
the most unnecessary movie ever
This is insufferable
"I'll be honest, this looks terrible"
This looks so much fun to watch its on my list for sure
"This looks bonker fun, a classic WB brain tickler"
"Can't Hollywood make something that's not a Marvel movie, not a remake, or not a sequel?"
"I can see the film ending with him telling someone ""well here we go"" right as the door to the factory opens and its the scene where we see him for the first time in the 1971 movie."
Can’t wait to hear all the conservatives call this “woke nonsense”
1:02  i may be tripping but did i just see mrbean in the flesh 😂😂😂😂
looks pretty amazing :)
YOOOOOO THIS IS GONNA B AWESOME
"I was worried about another remake, but this is actually a breath of fresh air. Kudos!"
"It looks really good. I think it will stand or fall with Timothée Chalamet (?) as Willy Wonka. Johnny Depp is just really brandmarked into my brain, he had that touch of otherworldly. And I somewhat feel like a Willy Wonka really needs that, since it’s not just chocolate- it literally defies gravity apparently."
MATTHEW BAYNTON OH MY GODDDDDD
Ain’t better than gene wilder
"Я одна прочитала на заставке ""Жопка""?))"
Жопка
Paul Atreides will lead another Chocolate Jihad!!
IT'S THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORIES
meh
I'm obsessed about Hughmpa Loompa !!!! The Best and funniest😂😂❤❤
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is nightmare fuel
Well looks like origin stories is the theme of movies this year
I’m excited to see this but I’m not a big fan seeing a Oompa Loompa cgi
My mother and I are going to love this prequel film.
The trailer gives me the classic movie trailer vibes lol
Wanka.
"If Disney made this
Wonka will be gender race swapped
And she will explain why she has two fathers"
"Why is this needed? It looks fun, sure, but it just feels like another cash grab"
This looks incredible. Gonna be an absolute Christmas treat.
Mr bean
Hollywood is REALLY trying to make this Chalamet kid happen.
Sadly this guy doesn't look charismatic enough
Жопка 😊
Must we?
Does it seem Timothee trying to do an imitation of Johnny Drop Willy Wonka with none of the charm
"These are all genuine comments and not bots/shills. No sir, all real."
"Hope doesn't have many songs , we love the old classic one"
How many times we gonna roll out the same movies give us something new
Oh no 😬
omg I CANT wait!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Whooooooooooooooo     Come with me and you will seee pure imagination. See you there ........
This looks great!
"I didn't know this was in the works, but it looks really good."
I already hate it. Too woke for me. The classic one and the Johnny Depp are the only 2 great versions. Plus that actor sucks
Just give chamalet the oscar
Bro who asked for this?
This immediately felt like Harry Potter.
Omg I can’t wait to see this 😂 Timothee Chalamet is a brilliant actor!
"It was a Factory, not a shop"
"Found the trailer. Thought I'd totally despise it, can't wait to watch it 😂"
"I was skeptical when I read the title, expecting another boring and soulless reimagining but this looks very promising. Looking forward to it."
the casting !!!?
Ah cool yeah no thanks
i thought willy wonka is from disney. well i hope this is good cause johnny depp willy wonka is really good
🙄🙄🙄
Wonka without rhythm.
This looks great! <3 Awesome casting
1:34 it’s the guy from horrible histories
Should’ve called it WILLY
"I wasn't sure until they showed the HARRY POTTER text in the HARRY POTTER font, but because I liked HARRY POTTER I am reassured and will consume this product!"
This Wonka has too much energy for me. He doesn't seem socially awkward enough.
"A movie about how one of my favourite characters, created by one of my favourite novelists, for one of my favourite books of all time came to be?!? I'm in!!!
Yessiree bob; this looks to me like a product of pure imagination! I'm sure it will do well at capturing the magic/spirit/tone of the book, too!"
"I was really not on this film's side because, you know, pointless remake/spin off but god damn it, I am more than a bit intrigued I have to say."
Another remake force-feeding new black characters into the mix. This looks absolutely atrocious. What happened to actors with talent? This is guaranteed to lose money.
"FFS can we get good, fresh stories for once and not endless and unnecessary rehashings of existing IP's"
this looks so generic and low energy and Timothy Chalamet comes across so uncharismatic in this trailer.
"A movie no one asked for. A prequel to something that didn't need one. On today's sequels, prequels and franchise  movies, if would be nice to see something original that wasn't hooked to an existing or past property."
Why what's the point of this
"it looks like it's fun. not too serious, understands that source material."
0:31 MATT BAYNTON?!?!?!?!?!?!? AHAHAHHAHA I LOVE HIM
Remember: Timothee Chalamet is the young version of Willy Wonka. This movie is a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
why timothee look like lil mabu?
I forgot this was happening. But it looks so fun!!
Again?
"Fickelgruber is gonna be in this
He’s the one who stole from Wonka"
So badly casted
The original movie was… Original.
"So Warner is making movies like Disney now, great!!, cause Disney is too woke now terrible at making real movies."
I hate prequels but this looks like it'll be a good one
He look like Carol from Mr.Beast lol
This looks really cute and good
"First, Gene Wilder forever.  That being said I will give this a fair chance, as it looks fun 😊.  And if we can get a cameo in there for Slugworth that would cinch it for me."
"All dreams must mean something.
My dreams:"
"Movie looks fun, but Timothee is absolutely NOT selling me that he’s Willy Wonka. There was always this unhinged/slightly insane vibe to Wonka (both Wilder and Depp’s) and Timothee is giving off more of a ‘quirky’ vibe than genuinely off his rocker. Everything else looks fun and interesting though."
i spotted 3 london locations
Oh johnny depp i mis u more than anything
"Why tf are there so many black people? Basically guarantees that this movie is bad. Give us good story, not social engineering."
They’re casting kid in too much. Trying to capitalize on whatever his fan base sees. Just doesn’t fit. Super soft
As soon as I saw the paddington director was involved I knew it was gonna be good
"The fact that this is based off the Gene Wilder version turns me off of it completely I couldn't stand that movie, and neither could Roald Dahl"
"I don't understand how he can enslave the oompa loompas in today's climate, they will probably write around that"
Do we really need this?
It's great to see Hugh grant in this movie. I love seeing oopmpa loompa in this movie.
nooooooo
Nahh nothing beats Depp
No no no no no. Worst idea ever.
"Totally can’t wait to see this. This is what we’ve all been waiting for, an origin story of Roald Dahl’s Wonka."
who did the casting they need a raise
If only it were camp
I really loved Johnny Depp's version. I'm interested to see how this turns out. Looks interesting.
"You can’t outperform Gene Wilder. Stop trying to outperform Gene Wilder.

Thank you,
The World."
"Well third times the charm, let's see how it does~"
"Another crappy remake of a classical movie. 

Nothing beats the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory! 

Gene Wilder is the BEST Willy Wonka period!!!!!"
"Nah...
I still prefer the old version of wonka"
I don't know.  I'm not liking it.
Not as good as the orginal one
BOoooooooooo! yawn!
Жопка!
greatest showman vibes
blackwashing needs to stop
Maybe it's because Im the same age as Timothee Chalamet but I cant take him seriously in a role that I grew up feeling like is for a grown man.
This looks fun
"take notes Disney, THIS is how you do remakes RIGHT"
This is what creative bankruptcy looks like.
I feel like they should’ve casted someone older
Wonka’s double huh was to use slave labour by smuggling oompa loompas into his sweatshop/factory
The only thing that looks good about this movie is literally one scene and it’s of course about the Oompa Loompa.
Looks absolutely horrible. They cast the wrong guy for the role. Wonka should be more mysterious; creepy at times. Why go with CGI Ompa Lompas? Disappointed in this garbage.
This looks terrible 💩
This looks absolutely terrible
"Oh, please not another beloved character that’s going to be totally destroyed, no one asked for this movie"
"""He who controls the chocolate controls the universe"""
this looks terrible lmfao
why is the oompa loompa basically stewie griffin 😭
Willy WOke-A
"Hugh as Oompa is good, but Chalamet as Wonka is so boring."
"If I don't see a young version of Charlie's grandpa, I will be so dissapointed."
Oompa loompa doompety doo
"Well, a uplifting and festive movie to have fun and be entertained with your family with no woke bs or identity politics in it? Not from Disney I see…
Count me in!"
this actuallly looks really cute and good
I don't know why but: no.
his voice doesn't fit this at all or his style.  i think they could have cast better with hugh jackman or Jeremy Allen White maybe even Hugh Laurie  or Benedict Cumberbatch
Need Jonny depp 😢
Chalamet has Dune part 2 and Wonka releasing in November and December. He’s on a roll
My favourite part of the trailer is when Rowan Atkinson screams “Run Away!!” In his mr bean voice or the fact that Key from Key & Peele is in it
"Why do they keep redoing this movie, let it rest and come up with something new"
Willy Wonka loves chocolate = He's into black chicks!
"timothy's line delivery sounds so bad. sounds forced with zero personality. with Gene Wilder, it felt authentic."
"Man, Timothée Chalamet seems like the best actor for the next generation of movies. This man is quite talented!"
This feels like an SNL skit.
Is it just me or does Timothie's performance in this seem a bit uninspired. Can't judge just from a trailer though.
I never realized how much Timothy looks like Daniel Thrasher
That's a really good Daniel Thrasher impression Timothee is doing.
Wow imagine trying to sell me a Willy Wonka origin story. The original story is about charlie. Maybe these idiots don't get that wonka was only interesting because he was closed off to the public. Now the guy is some super positive guy making magic candy. Roald dahl deserves better.
"I don’t know how I feel about Timothy, I’m getting modern acting and it’s taking me out of the time period of the movie. gene wilder had a sense of wonder , whimsy and wackiness to him that Timothy seems to be lacking."
"Oh, another willy wonka remake"
"Love him in the king and dune, this gonna be another iconic depiction of wonka."
Ok you know what? This is hype! I'm really looking forward to this!
Woke Willy - never mind you can have him.
Looks like it's gonna be woke trash. And the Oompa Loompas are too damn small.
It looks amazing! Looking forward for it
ARRGGHH THE OOMPA LOOMPA’S 👹👹👹👹
So the color purple and Wonka this is gonna be a great holiday season
"I am sooo excited for this!! I feel like we haven't had a fun, festive, magical feeling movie in years!! Can't wait to see what Chalamet brings to the table as Wonka!!"
Welcome to the Wizarding World of Willy Wonka!
Is that Alan Johnson from peep show 😂
"…meh…

On and off it caught my attention. But…

…meh. I really hope it’s not connected to Depp or Wilder, and is it’s own thing, because otherwise, it doesn’t make any sense."
Gotta go see it just for Hugh Loompa.
Hugh Grant lol
Meh
Ok not connected with trailer 😢 but want to see movie then we decide it's good or not let see
I hate that boy.
Yikes. Hard pass.
"Wow, simply awful"
It's Finally Here The Wonka Remake.
Looks like a Milk Dud.
I am really excited to see this movie. 😍😍😍😍😍😍
Timothee Chalamet has that lead actor voice like Chris Pine's
Why dont they use freddie highmore :(
Kid playing wonka is trying WAY too hard…
❤❤❤
🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️
Damn i was hoping for johnny depp to be wonka again...
this will flop epically
"Oh Wow, I assumed Timothée Chalamet was a better actor than what I just saw #Sheesh stick to solemn drama son!"
big let down. did not like it.
Fully onboard for this.
I would love to see Ezra Miller play Wonka!
"Willy Wonka is a sociopath, will Wonka embrace this characterization?"
Is this a video?
Uh oh.
I swear Johnson just flashed up on my screen…
The very idea of this movie seemed like an awful idea to me until I saw that the Director of Paddington is directing this. Now I am 100% on board.
why am I crying??
"Film looks bad...and talk about cultural appropriation hiring white male actor hugh grant and doing orange face when there are real oompa loompas looking for work and being overlooked because of whitey yet again...I always see short, fat, orange women when I go out on a night out"
"This Movie is 

Adventurous

Musical

Comedy

Drama

&

100% CHOCOLATE."
"I'm not sure about this one, but I'm going to watch it because I always wanted that Golden Ticket."
I am happy this is an origin and not just a remake of the original film and book.
A prequel of the book and movie “Charlie and the chocolate factory” not Tim Burton “Willy Wonka” this is I gotta see.
Oof hard pass. The guy playing wonka has talent but you are never going to beat the original.
Mmm ... Willy Woke ... i pass
Load of shite
Gotta love revisionism…
OMG brilliant.  The only way they could have done it (a prequel) so not to compete directly with Gene Wilder.  We need more movies like this!!
They should of hired. Little person this is total disrespect. Why did they hire Hugh grant?  Cancel this movie.
Can't wait to Swamp My Wonka to this.
They had me at “Director of Paddington”
"""Once we start dancing we can't stop"" is what sold me ahahahahaha"
"Interesting how the trailer on youtube has a lot positive reviews, yet other outlets have more negative ones..."
"Love the how they use “pure imagination” in this, the inspiration is lovely"
Woke movie?    Let see the original movie 🎉   ( new movie 🎬  a woke 100 )
Really driving whatever they can into the ground
I like this a lot already didn't think another sequel could look so good
WHAT.
Be crazy if Johnny depp cameos in this movie
Another film about this? Prolly woke out the wazoo Wonka.
Is that chalamet
Timothée Chamalamadingdongdo is a big no for me.
This…. Doesn’t work.
Not really feeling the setting
Where is Johnny Depp ? :cc
When this comes online I'll watch it. Looks so cute.
Wasnt Charlie’s dad a dentist? From the original movie??
This is my joker
How long before Paddington 3 ?
Wow this looks terrible..another cash grab to ruin another childhood movie...So many movies destroyed by wokewood lately..
Bro isn't even acting he's just raising his voice lmao this looks awful
I dont like forced black characters
Timothee Chalamet is literally so attractive. I'm going to melt
"I was excited when I first heard about this film, but now I’m not certain… part of the fun of the original story was that Wonka’s factory was a magical part of a mundane world, but everything here looks fantastical. I’ll still see it and give it a chance!"
I like how Chalamet seems to be borrowing from Gene Wilder’s classic performance as Willy Wonka.
Kylie thing was def PR.
They thought they could surpass Tim Burton and Johnny Depp?
"From what I've seen, Johnny Depp can sleep well!"
Is Mr. Bean the priest?!😂
I was almost unhappy till i saw it was Timothee and now im super excited!!! He embodies Willy Wonka so well!
"GARBAGE NWO PROPOANDA............""OHHHHHH WOW IS THERRE A TOKEN BLACK GIRL NOW????????"""
This looks....ehh
Here we gooo....🙄
Laaaame. The whole point of wonka was his mystery.
"The trailer could have been reduced to the last bit with Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa, and it would have been enough for me to book a ticket 6 months in advance."
Im so exciteddddjddkjdksdk
I couldn't help but think of Daniel Thrasher when I saw this.
This looks colorful and just fun. It looks great to me.
Thank god they didn’t make him black
"Ompa lompa dopa-de-do how many bumps of K can you do....🔊🎶NO🚫⚠
Thats a No Bueno for me. Sorry Timmy. I will however be seeing DUNE Part 2."
"This looks like a really fun, sweet and adventurous movie with hints of innocence. This movie looks great. Mom and I are all in. We can't wait until December!!!"
They need to explain wonka making the tunnel.
Nice!
"Looks great, but would've been better if Tim Burton directed."
A double huh☝️🤓
"Finally
Been waiting for so long for this❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️"
this looks good
"Can’t wait to see! However, this trend of adding a (presumably) bland, totally unnecessary and uninteresting black female character to a white male MC is both hilarious and annoying. So, she will either be a well-written character (which is as rare as a good villain) or a total waste of screen time, which could’ve been given to Timothee Chalamet."
"PURE> TRASH>

Help we have no more creativity so we must recycle old stuff in an extremely soulless way. - Hollywood"
How dare they take such liberties with Dahl’s work? If they wanted another movie why not just make Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator?
"Well, at least he doesn't look like Michael Jackson this time..."
The origins of Hershey 😂.
This looks like a really fun and interesting movie I haven’t seen Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory since I was a kid bringing this back now is filling my heart with joy and I hope the younger generation gets the same experience and enjoyment I did watching the original
"24 horas en un coche
nadie más puede arruinar mi noche
solo tu
solo tu"
Timothee Chalamet really nailed it as a young Willy Wonka.
Not interested unless they have the original oompa loompas before the book was censored
Жопка
Wonka Origins
"You had me at ""...writer/director of Paddington"""
This might be really good.
"This movie looks WAY better than it had any right to be. Timothee Chalamet already LOOKED the part of Wonka, but after seeing this trailer he genuinely FEELS like the character. Also, Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is unexpectedly amazing lmao."
"I already see myself in the cinema, watching this movie with a huge bag of popcorn and A LOT of chocolates!"
Eh idk I didn’t feel like it was anything special from this trailer. Seems somewhat boring.
Gene Wilder would be proud
This looks gorgeous I can't wait to see this movie this December this is just a awesome trailer.
HARD PASS
Terrible casting. Chalamet has no sense of how to have a wacky type of charisma that Wonka is supposed to have. Just some regular likable teenage guy.
"YES 
YESSSSSSSS
ROALD DAHLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
Not this guy again
I don't mean any disrespect towards Timothée. I consider him becoming a fabulous actor movie after movie but their can't be anyone playing the character of Wily Wonka better than the Johnny Depp himself. He's is remarkable when it comes to play characters in fantasy movies.
Ineed to see more not sold on timothee as Wonka...
How many times does the movie need a make over they are really milking it.?.😅
That’s literally just Timothee Chalamet dressed as Wonka. He hasn’t sold me. I don’t believe he’s Willy Wonka. I’ll still see it but prolly not in theatres.
Johnny Depp was the best.This one Meh. I don’t get how this Timothy even became an actor😅
Another remake...WooHoo! To not so bodily go where we've been multiple times before... Pass!
Boring the bottom has been ripped out of this many a time😮
lost me at the choreographed dancing day dream.
I Love Wonka Best Movie Favorite!
This actually looks pretty good.  I think I'll be dragging my disabled backside to the theater for this one.
Eh... why is this happening...?
I’m so excited to see this! 😍 They filmed a part of this in Lyme Regis and I could see the set from the town
Wow!
So this is like a prequel.
"Made me smile, hope the movie is a good time at the theatres."
I always love an underdog kind of story where the person beats the living daylights at the giants corporations and wins against the odds. So I'm looking forward to it. Probably will come out near xmas.
"Everything looked great until Hugh Grant became an Oompa Loopa. That is super cringe, and the face tracking was off."
"„I started dancing now. 
Once we‘ve started we can‘t stop“
You can hear in his tone that it’s involuntary"
Выглядит не хуже чем с Джонни Деппом
"Great, I'm a simp again."
Was that Mr Mosby?? 1:07
"that sure is a lot of brown ""people"" for a victorian era movie"
"hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm disappointing but u never know what it really says about the film, surprisingly unsure about timmy"
"I think this movie is gonna be a musical, origin and the power of imagination into one perfect masterpiece. If of the song is gonna be ""the wonderful of imagination"" and that would be nice to add in this movie."
Rowan Atkinson :)
Oh great. Another Wonka remake
I didn’t know I needed to see Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa was something I needed to see.
Bruh this movie sucks already Willy wonka ain’t magical
"Oompah loompah doopity dop
This looks like it could very well flop"
"My husband messaged me ""I'm not sure this looks like it's any good, but it stars ya boy Chamalamadingdong"" which means you know I'm going to go see it ;)"
"They like beating dead horses, don't they?"
Timmy where is the call me by your name 2 ??!!?
Oh.....kay. I want whatever the director/writer/producers are on. Looks fun.
"I’ve come up with this amazing idea of what the ending of Wonka could be! Almost like a bonus scene kind of thing when the film has finished but just before the credits. I imagine the film builds up Wonka’s story, from his childhood to him getting his own shop and then factory etc. What if the ending scene was him as an older man, opening up the doors to the chocolate room. With Charlie, Veruca, Violet, Augustus and Mike all by his side. They walk in and he sings Pure Imagination."
"Is it just me or Thimothée Chalamet's expressions here are really similar to Daniel Thrasher's???


Actually now that I think about they look kinda similar..."
"For me Johnny Depp is the only Willy Wonk~ 
NO ONE CAN REPLACE

No hate to Timothée"
AMAZING PRODUCTION.  I can't wait to see it.  Timothée Chalamet so young and soo amazing actor 😍.
"The last time I checked, Willy Wonka didn’t have a bläck girlfriend!!! But whatever. Welcome to the woke generation."
"Did they ever make a ""Great Glass Elevator"" movie? When are we going to see Wonka fight some aliens?"
I can’t wait to discover how Willy became Wonka.
This looks horrible
"Wow, a movie for kids that doesn't have some political BS message(from what I can perceive). How refreshing!"
"Timothee Chalamet is the TikTok influencer version of Willy Wonka. He is the bland and depressing ""artificial chocolate"" while Gene Wilder is the rich and tasteful ""real chocolate""."
"I feel like this would be a cute movie, but the natural charm of Willy Wonka isn’t there with the main character. At least for me."
I really hope weight gain is a major plot point
Absolutely soulless
Жопка😅
"This looks like fun, but I'm getting Greatest Showman vibes. I'm in!"
What a bunch of bollocks! They made a soy boy out of Wonka! How then he is supposed to make quality chocolate?
"Clearly a musical, but they seem to be somewhat hiding that fact."
debo decir que esta película es pura !!NOSTALGIA!! a que si yo la he visto un montón desde chico alguien
This should be better than Johnny Depp but not as good Gene Wilder
"I haven't seen the Gene Wilder version and don't intend to. Even if I had, I would still give this one a chance. What's the problem? Why all the hate? OK, you have a sweet childhood memory connected to the original. So? That doesn't give you the right  to bash something new that comes along. Love the original all you want and leave a new generation to maybe fall in love with this version. The world is still spinning and time hasn't stopped. New music, movies and art are created every day. It's  your loss if your eyes and ears are closed off for it."
"Wonkas competitors trying to murder him by literally drowning him in chocolate seems like something that should be jarring and too dark, but that's basically how he runs his factory too."
"This is why movies failing miserly, doing the same bs over and over and over…people are bored, bring new stuff ffs…will fail miserably for sure"
"This is what happens when you take too much spice until you get to a point you get blue eyes... and that's how you become, a Chocolate Factory God."
W FILM
Wait what? I didn't know Rowan Atkinson was gonna be in this movie. I'm impressed!!!
Gene Wilder would be very proud.
You lost me with casting Hugh Grant in this movie
I don't want to like this. Stop making me like this.
Omg!!!  Stop recreating movies. The talent isn't there anymore.....
Something you can actually enjoy watching
"Looks like an incredible film! Shame about the voices though tbh considering it’s a British classic, was Wonka a seppo in the books? Or is the accent there to highlight how foreign he is?"
wowee this looks terrible
Жопка
Timmy appears to be wildly miscast.
This looks god awful.
"Oh my God, an actual, genuine, lighthearted movie with whimsy and wonder? 

Yes please 👏"
"This has piqued my interest.  I'll put this in the list along with Napolean.

Also, here me out in this one, Willy Wonka is an ancestor of House Atreides..."
I wonder if they will tie Wonka into the Harry Potter Universe?
You know I'm something of a magician scientist chocolate maker myself.
Well that looks stupid af
Sometimes dreams really do come to life :) 🤔😍😃
For F**K sake can Hollywood come up with something remotely original and entertaining?
"good to see Hollywood, making an original movie, Wonka #342...."
Why is (The Sound of Freedom) movie being censored?
"I don’t think it’ll live up to the previous two howeverrrr, it does look enjoyable and somewhat festive which we’ve been lacking on for a while. It’s a definite watch"
"And once again......Hollywood has ZERO left in the tank.

RIP Gene Wilder. (The only true W.W.)"
who up wonking they willy
"According to Chris Snellgrove's article for Giant Freakin Robot, this is ""the dumbest video I will watch today."" And Mr Snellgrove is the dumbest person I will hear from today! This was an amazing trailer, can't wait until Christmas!!🍫🎄✨"
"I normally roll my eyes and run from these remakes, bit this seems like they actually cared about the source material. You can see bits and pieces of it throughout. I'm tentatively excited."
Wtf? This isn't how I'd imagine wonka at all. He looks too young
That psycho still get gigs?
Жопка
Where? Switzerland?
Awful
"Good Morning Starshine, The Earth Says ""Hello!"""
"A feel-good movie with solid production and memorable characters, feel like we haven't had one of these in a little while. The fact the trailer is already making me smile gives me hopes it'll be a nice festive movie for Christmas"
"soo excited for another light hearted campy movie, glad they seem to be making a resurgence"
This is one of the worst trailers I've seen since CATS.
Oh wow I can’t wait to see this movie about the famous guy who wears a big hat and kills lots of people!! What? What do you mean this isn’t the Napoleon trailer?
OMG 😱 ❤❤❤really this is mostly exciting in decade can’t Believe who I love two Willy Wonka movies I love movie that involves Candy and lot lot of Chocolate 🍫 🍫🍫😍😍😍 kids love chocolate and sweets 🍭
Willy Woka and the Communist Party.
"I did not expect to be interested, but wow!  It looks great, and what a cast!  Am I the only Paterson Joseph fan?  Haven't seen him in a while.  Hugh Laurie, Rowan Atkinson, John Carter from Downton Abbey, Olivia Coleman (the best!), Timothy Chalamet, Sally Hawkins.  Incredible!  I haven't watched the original but this looks more up my alley -- beautifully filmed with a vintage feel to it."
Ok this is awesome I’m watching
Actual effort? 🤔
there was no need for a random black child there
Please God no.
Ok this looks splendid but I NEED a young Grandpa Joe cameo or something for it to be perfect
Woke trash
Hope this bombs hard
Looks like good fun
Just QUIT!! You pathetic bastards
"Well, that proves it. They are actively making Tim into a new Jhonny Depp."
"Oh wow, I feel like a child again just watching this!!"
TIMOTHE CHAOMLETTWEE
"He lacks the silliness that Wilder and Depp brought to us. However, I've been unsure of some castings that turned out to be pitch-perfect casting. So I guess we'll see"
"This looks so good! Man, I just wanna enjoy movies again…save the day Wonka! Lol"
This is what the world needs. Actual talent and care put into it.
Now we finally got an origin story of Willy Wonka🍫❤
"Gene wilder was the greatest and they are spitting on his grave doing this. Come up with an original movie, even though that doesn't happen anymore. Please burn this movie."
This actually looks good
Oh… oh no… oh God no..
Again???
Nope!
❤
"Probably an unpopular opinion, but I really don't think Chalamet is right for the part."
This looks right
Mr Mosby is that you???
"Why are you so all excited about another remake of a movie that's already had a remake? There is no creativity anymore, just remakes, that's all they do and it's sad... Where are the original stories? Where are the original heroes?"
"I came here skeptical, but I am leaving excited."
This feels not quite right. Wonka doesn't seem eccentric  enough. I feel like they are playing it safe. Can't say I'm excited for this one.
"Hugh Grant hitting the same notes Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka did hit me hard, love the homage to the classic"
Is there not 2 Charlie and the chocolate factory movies already
I still can’t believe this is real 🤡
ugggggg
Goosebumps.
"_Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator_ was right there... and you decide to do an original prequel? 
WHY?"
0:31 MATT BAYNTON!
"Huh...I was skeptical, but I really like the tone of this! Colour me curious"
"They spilled some ""Oz the Great and Powerful"" in my Wonka prequel."
❤❤
the wonka rapture is approaching next episode of wonka watch will be a treat
"Loved the original with Gene Wilder as a kid.  Have seen it countless times.  I HATED Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka.  This new story is a different story line and it looks interesting.  
I'm looking forward to it."
Chocolate cartel is crazy
I don't think I'm ready for a tiny little Hugh Grant as umpa lumpa.
"Hollywood is milked dry it seems of any creative, original ideas. We need an entertainment Renaissance.  Reimagined,  movies piggybacking off the success of its predecessors."
"By George, I think he's got it. 🎉🍫😆"
Oh mr. Bean speaks
They really adding Diversity to everything now huh it’s too much to ask for an accurate period piece and of course the main ingredient add interracial relationship
So this will be a precuel to the Charlie and the chocolate factory movie? Interesting
This looks TERRIBLE.
"Wonder if they’re going to show how he loses his mind and sets up an elaborate scheme to murder four children for gluttony, watching too much tv, being a spoiled brat, and chewing gum."
Chamalette seems nailed the young Willy Wonka. Or perhaps better than Johnny Depp version.
"Isn’t this the same dude who despises doing any super hero role because he’s above it and doesn’t wanna be widely known as a superhero? So you mean to tell me, you did WONKA INSTEAD?!?!? Lmfao, In what way is wonka not gonna follow your career long term?"
The de-aging on Johnny Depp is phenomenal 👏
Why did they make Willy Wonka hot?
Excelent
I hope the Haunted Chocolatier is released around the same time.
Can we go maybe 10 years without remake of a remake probably of a remake...... the original is still always going to be the best
Where is johnny depp? What is this.........????? :x
No
Isn't this the guy from MrBeast?
....Okay but why?
Might as well made Willy blk too  .
"Omg a prequel to Gene Wilder's Willy Wonka? I love that they've preserved the ""definitely in Europe yet somehow still American"" setting."
This trailer is better than the Depp remake. 👍👍
He is a terrible choice for Wonka.
So we're getting a remake of a remake of a remake? Got it. Another flop coming up.
I’m actually excited for this movie!!
"They got one of the most stifled actors who mainly just stands around stoutly without emoting much, to be one of the most whimsical characters. Horrible casting choice fr. Then there is the fact that this is just a lazy film, making a prequel to a successful classic film instead of something new."
Ruining another classic. Worthless untalented corporate morons.
It's not Willy Wonka without Johnny Depp..
A cookie cut chocolate treat by the looks of it
Another Wonka movie 😐
"Love the atmosphere, hope it will enterain me like the last one with Johhny👍"
Why was the soda that made you float so secret if he did it 20+ years earlier with just candy? This is typical zoomer writing.
Love how you can her Pure Imagination playing in the back
They should have included a cameo from Johnny Depp
I think it looks spectacular. It’s one of those stories that you never thought about but know you’ll love because of all of the childhood memories 🌹
Looks great 👍 👌 😀
who up wonking they willy rn?
Who asked for this?
Director of Paddington it has to be good.
"i was excited for this but imo Timothée Chalamet does not fit the role. Its seems the script is more around him as an actor rather then Willy Wonka. He makes it feel like another take on Peter Pan versus a Willy Wonka story. idk, just my vibes."
Timonthee has so much skill.
Trailer was mid until the oompa loompa then it became legendary
"looks good, good way to end out the year 🍫"
WHAT TIMMY IS WONKA
Why do modern movies always have this dumbass cliche one word title
Original movie is better
I got so hyped until “this December“ 😫
What a shame this exists.
AAA CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH THIS CUTIE PATOOTIE OF A MOVIE <333
"What a shame that this classic has also been destroyed by woke diversity. That black woman side chick doesn't even seem to belong, Hollywood again said,""yeah just toss a black person into meet out quota"". This may have been good but I will have stop supporting Warner and possible Timothy also"
"I’m not gonna lie, I think I love this 😂"
Timothee chalamet is so mediocre
"The Willy Wonka prequel we needed, but did not realize we needed."
Willy Wanka more like!
Blackwashed Willie Wokeass
sorry to tell but i think why movies are failing nowadays coz the CGI magic is gone. everything feels fake on screen
I have to say that this is the first time a trailer gave me goosebumps I have a good feeling about this one the fact that it is from the director of Paddington. Wonka's lead actor has a spirituality of Gene Wilder take of the iconic role and that is great.
"Lovely, will be watching"
the endless remakes continue O___O
bit like harry potter
"This will definitely be a flop!! Why must every movie nowadays have this type of casting? quit ruining good old movies, and make your own movies with that BS!"
After seeing his Chocolate  had effects i cant not see him as a drug dealer inventing edibles for the first time and big Chocolate an't having it
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa might be the best thing I've ever seen
Yeah that Tim Burton joint was fire tho.
Stupid casting
"Feels like the same movie as every other one coming out nowadays, yawn."
This will be the perfect Christmas film ❤️
i was definetly not interested in this until the cgi monsotity at the end... i was thinking during the whole trailer where are the damn umpa loompas!?
Love love love love it !!!!
Keeping blacks employed right Disney.
"Nope. There was one Willy Wonka and one Johnny Depp. Sorry Disney, but nope."
I can’t lie I don’t rlly know why we need a third version of this story (fourth if you count the Broadway musical) but it’s Timmy so I’m here for it
Жопка
They should have made him pale
Wow Hollywood is so creative! Another remake of a remake.
Wow.......this actually looks quite magnificent if I do say so myself.
J adore à voir ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
Cool! I don't care! But keep up burning money.
Once we started we can’t stop 😂😂😂
this looks absolutely terrible
"Oh Willy Wonka how you get so tasty 
Mom made a boy should have made a pastry"
Now this is something I needed
"The overall movie looks good, but the acting feels a bit off. The Ooma Loompa bit at the end was hilarious tho so I’m probably still going to see it 😂"
Willy WOKE
Uh yes please!!!!!! This looks delicious! Pun intended.
Went in with low hopes. Looks great.
1:03 Looks like Rowan Atkinson lol
Hard NO
Rowan  Atkinson in wonka? What more could we ask for
"i'm a simple man, i saw Forced Black People, i put this on the must-not watch list."
God help us all.
"So is this a pequal to the book, the original film, the reboot film, or its own universe"
Wow! The prequel movie no has ever asked for!
I hope they explain where the black people came from 🤔
Something about Hugh Grant as an Oompalumpa just made me laugh.
If only it was directed by the director of Paddington 2
Please....can we just get an original idea please?
Willie Woke-ah
"The Paddington production team and Chalamet sounds like a recipe for success right here, especially for the latter as Dune, Part 2 is also guaranteed to be a success!"
It doesn't really look too bad. I can't see why it's getting so much hate as it is
Willi Wonka was my favourite movie...😍
Yeah and if I didn’t spell Hyundai right then it’s bc it’s not it - just the mall.
"If you want to see a good movie, watch (the sound of freedon)."
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING?
Looks awful
AHHH TIMOTHEE
Wonka is the only thing that didn’t convince me aka timothe… the rest of the cast is amazingly
This seems like it would be a great movie! My only irk is the accents of the main characters. Other than that it looks like it would be interesting to watch.
My first thought why is he American
whoa that diversity. i've never seen so many black people at oncew.
? This a prequel of the og cuz of this og song
I love it!
This is what Paul Atreides sees when he goes into sugar shock.
Pure propaganda.. 🤮 🍫
"Lots of bots stating good things to me this is just another racial propaganda movie just like 

“She hulk”

“Bat woman”

“Egypt wanna be documentary”"
I hope this is good enough to bring back the discontinued Wonka-to-life candies. I miss my gobstoppers.
This wonka Is timothee chalamer when he grow up he Will be the Willy Wonka of Jonnhy deep!!  🩷🩷🇬🇧🇬🇧
Nah......makes no sense to have the main character have an American accent and everyone else have an English accent. He sounds very out of place in this movie.
I AM SO READY FOR THIS
"Paul Atreides having a nightmare due to spice overdose..
-
But jokes aside, this is one good prequel to a great movie that we will get. A pity that it is released only now(when it could have been released 10 or even 20 years ago).."
"Yeah, I figured this was gonna look pretty awful. Did not disappoint."
Soo many great actors. That is rarity
Looks boring. Dissapointing. And really? What's wrong with your casting director? Previous Wonka movies were so much better. We don't need this bs
Love It !!
tbh i'm not that impressed. I would've loved to see jim carrey play willie wonka.
"Gosh, this looks really bad."
Finally a trailer in 4K yes!
Not a good role for Timmy 😢 Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa lollllll
I waaaaaaaaaannnnttttt!!!!!!!!!!!
Really? We’re flogging this dead horse again?
I hated Johnny Depp's Wonka.
The same oompa loompa design in willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Come up with something new already. Reasons HollyWeird is ⚰️
Seeing Rowan atkinson running away in a priest outfit and Hugh Grant as a oempa loempa. I've seen it all 😂
TRASH INLIKE OLD ONE BYE
Meh.
How many times are they going to remake this movie? You can't beat the original with Gene Wilder.
Awesome.. something that has been done already. A reimagining of a reimagining
"I see a splash of Gene Wilder vibes, I’m in"
Ahhh this seems like a good wholesome festive movie ☺️ something I think we need more of
Hard pass
I'm underwhelmed by the acting in this trailer.
But why? Just leave stuff alone
They made the Oompa Loompas too small 😭
"I hate remakes, but this isn't a remake, i don't think.  It looks good.  I hope it's fresh like when you walk into a new room and turn your head to look at every nook and cranny."
here we go again
This has got to be one of the best years of Cinema comeback!
I don't think Timothee can pull off playing a whimsical dude. It seems very out of place.
WONKA
Nope
"I cannot wait to see this, it looks amazing and refreshing ❤❤❤❤"
The chocolatier has awakened
21k btw
It's for kids and teens and family the movie looks for since it's aimed for that not 33 year olds but it will smash with tim at the lead smart choice
😁💛💙❤️💜
this looks bad.... the acting is so bad too
"Ok the movie is sold to me, BUT hugh grant as oompa Loompa?? take all my money now!!!!"
That feeling when Paul Atreides snorts the wrong spice.
I think this is exactly what we need in modern movies! This looks great!
"NICE! At first I was like: ""Nnnoooo not ANOTHER remake!"" and then I was like ""Ok...now why aren't there any Oompa Loompas!!!"" Well played WB...well played...can't wait!"
Lessggooo man
Am i the only one not sold on Chamalama's acting in this role? Hes trying too hard to be quirky but it isnt really in him
"Won’t be good as the original, I can already see lol"
"Timmy looks so wonderful as Willy 🥺
Can't wait to see the all magic and beauty in this movie! 💗"
I'm just wondering: was this movie really necessary?
WB WTF are u trying to loose money like Disney. What and why? Who would green light this. Trying to out loose the flash? Indiana Jones already did that
"It’s amazing how Timothee Chalamet can play the cold, detached leader of a domineering, authoritarian empire, and Paul Atreides"
aHH A Good Christmas movie this year already
"Funny how Hollywood tries to erase blacks oppression and treat them equal in movies. The lil girl perfect but the cops, workers etc? Cmon man!"
Naw
I will only watch if they acknowledge the connection between Willy Wonka and Wilford from Snowpiercer.
"#Cancellation of Blue Beetle. Who hurts with iron, iron will be hurt. #CANCELLATION BLUE BEETLE"
Why is boyfriend timmy speaking in an American accent?
This looks pretty good cant wait to see it .
dont look very good compared with the one with johnny deep ...
"OMG I WILL BE THERE NO MATTER WHAT!! I’ve waited so long for a new Wonka movie, it looks incredible! The oompa loompa flute call is heaven to my ears 😍❤️"
"Like they said in the trailer, he's good too good. of an actor"
"Please let this be Willy WONKa and not Willy WOKEa

EDIT 7 months later: It is Willy WOKEa....    who knew?"
Once we've started we cant stop 😅
I know I did not just see Rowan Atkinson 🫣
Bruh. No one can beat Gene Wilder.
❤
This is a whole lot better than what they tried to do with the reboot
bro this gave me super goosebumps. I wanna make film like this and tell my stories like that
ITS GONNA BE A MUSICAL?????? IM SO EXITED!!!!
Damn this movie looks good
SHUT UP AND TAKE ALL MY MONEY!!!!
"As soon as I saw ""From the Director of Paddington"" I knew this was going to be good."
No original ideas left at the mouse house
willy wanka!!!!
This looks great!!
I'm sorry but this honestly looks so stupid. The original is obviously the best. The Depp remake was good but he took the character a lil too dark in that movie. But this looks absolutely horrible and is ruining the name of wonka
This is going to be incredible!
"Is it just me or is the supporting cast pulling this film up? I have nothing against Chalamet, but this trailer ain't selling his acting, imho."
Ohhhhhh myyyyyy gawwwwddddd cant wait
He is trying so hard to be Depp... its cringe.
Meh
"Time while show, but Charlie is girl who likes dark chocolate"
Jewish nepotism strikes again
"Spending the last two weeks watching the _Dune: Part Two_ trailer and now suddenly seeing this, this just messes with my head, but in a good way."
Выглядит афигенно!
Couldn't have picked a more annoying actor to play wonka...
"""Eh, who needs a Wonka prequel film?""

*From the director of Paddington*

""So when can I pre-order my tickets?"""
"""So quiet up, and listen down. Nope. Scratch that, reverse it."" hahaha"
This really does look pretty good
Sam nie wiem co jest słodsze. czekolada czy Timmy
I got goosebumps and a wee bit emotional from this version of Pure Imagination 🥹🥹🥹
This actually looks good
Hugh Grant? Is there a shortage of dwarf actors in Hollywood?
Timothy is too handsome to be Willy Wonka
"I think I have CGI fatigue, this looks so boring imho"
This looks like a mess.  Why does anyone want to know Wonka's origin story?  His mysteriousness is what made him intriguing.  Timothée Chalamet is an excellent actor but we all know he wont hold a candle to Gene Wilder.  I'm just tired of these terrible panic money grab movies from Hollywood.  Get some original ideas please.
"Did I hear this right bc I swear I just heard "" The Chocolate Cartel "". This movie is going to be lame"
This looks terrible.
"I'm glad this isn't a reboot, more of a prequel to the factory"
hmmm
"2,275,627 views, 128k likes, 8.1k comments, 11M subscribers, #1 on Trending. Nice!!"
"Mathew Baynton? Count me in, idiots!"
"God I hope this turns out to be a good movie! 😩

Unfortunately it looks like they ruined the oompa loompas again😒"
please oh please let this just be a good movie without any crapifying wokeness
"When Willy Wonka said ""Life is like a box of chocolates"" Ah wait this isn't Disney!"
Everyone loves a good serial killer origin story
"Another money grab that you'll all go see and continue to make sure all these A-List celebs continue to live lives far beyond yours while you toil away at McDonalds waiting for your very own ""Wonka"" moment."
Finaly something worth watching
is this based on real events??
We haven’t had this type of movies in yearssss the festive vibes yup will be watching
This should be good.
timothee.
Is there gonna be an OompaVille cameo?
Just why who asked for this movie
Oh no....
am i the only one that saw mr bean like the dude just doing  side quest
"Honestly looks like a good movie, but i kinda wish movie companys stopped refurbishing old classics and bringing them back, we need new material"
coming to be a huge DUD
No thanks
I hope they sell actual Wonka Bars in honor of this masterpiece.🍫
Been alot of let downs lets hope this doesn't ruin something I grew up watching.
They will learn when they loose millions 😂😂😂
"Oppenheimer, Barbie, dune and now THIS!!!! cinema gods are blessing me 😭😭😭😭❤️❤️❤️❤️"
IS THAT MATT BAYNTON
1:30 1:41 IS THAT KEEGAN-MICHAEL KEY AND ROWAN ATKINSON? I have to watch this movie!
Owwwww I love it!!!
i'm already crying and it's just the trailer.
One moment it’s taking itself wayyy to seriously about a dude making magical candies and the next it’s about a dude making magical candies and hilariously being taken as seriously as it should be.
Can we stop with these ridiculous remakes?
At least the lead actor isn’t played by Steve Harvey.
Rowan Atkinson 😍
This looks so much better than I thought it'd be.
YAWN another WOKE sham! I’ll stick to Gene Wilder! The ORIGINAL and the BEST!!
this is THE christmas movie we've all been needing
"its similar to ""The sound of magic"" Korean drama  but here they used chocolate which refers to magic in drama. 
But still it might be interesting.♥"
Why is Key in everything nowadays it seems lol
"It does look interesting, I’ll say that.

If I have one critique it would be it sounds like Wonka is acting not being.  But this feels more like an homage to Gene Wilder and I am all for that ."
The Trailer alone is still better than the tim Burton one.
"I honestly dont think he was the perfect choice for Willy. Movie still looks great tho, But it's just Willy Wonka himself that doesn't seem anything like him at all besides the outfit. it feels like a whole different character..."
There's a black actor literally every scene just to please the wokies lol
This looks terrible. Why do you keep making garbage remakes. Gene Wilders wonka is the only good one and these imitations are a shame.
Bean?!
This gonna be my favourite Christmas movie
Good to see the horrible history cast lol
Please stop making movies
It looks great!
Good thing they included all the minority actors in characters were they dont belong bc I was starting to get antsy without the requisite woke and forced diversity content to keep me from being raycessed.
WHATTTTT
"""Why Oompa Loompas, Master Wonka?""

""Oompa Loompas frighten me, it's time my enemies shared my dread"""
Thank you for not making this a musical throughout! Looks good and can’t wait to see it.
I’m so glad Keegan is this movie otherwise I would’ve went mad because why else would he be in this
So that's happening when you get an overdose of spice
Ok. This feels  like the beginning  of willy wonka and the chocolate factory 71'.  Lets see how this plays out
Why do people want to see this? Like no one asked for this?
"Damn, Hugh Grant will do literally anything these days."
This Trailer makes me want to shoot myself in the face. Why didn't he horrifically murder any spoiled rotten brats with his candy?
I don't remember Dune Messiah being like this.
Is nothing sacred in Hollywood?
Chocolate? Did you say “chocolate?”
A NEW WILLY WONKA MOVIE
Wanka
what...is this Sheniqua in the coco factory ?
cant wait
Timotheé definitely slightly channelled Gene Wilder’s version and I’m here for it but what seems like there’s a plot hole with Dr Wonka from Deep’s version and the braces/no candy storyline
The rags to riches willy wonka story. Ofc hollwood had to do this one. The benevolent capitalist.
"Paul Muad'Dib Wonka.  ""The chocolate must flow.""   Somehow that works."
"I don't want to like this, But I think I'm gonna."
"""From the Harry potter producers"" Yeah, im NOT watching!"
Can't wait
What a stellar cast!
You had me at Timothée Chalamet
Bunch of weirdos in this comment section. This movie looks just as bad as every other bad over produced movie we’ve had in the last 10 years. What happened to our standards? So sad 😞
Great so we have to go and interfere with the perfection of a classic 😐 yall are like mr crabs digging up a grave
I neeeed tooooo seeeeee thiiiiiis movie!!!!!!!!
This a hard nope for me
Are studios running out of new ideas for new movies? Why are there always reboots? Nothings new anymore just the same recycled movie.
Yyyyyeeeeeahhhh... I'm just gonna keep watching the Gene Wilder one.
Flip it and reverse it 😜
"Timothy's great, but Johnny Depp's performance just can't be beat. The charisma, the vibe he gave, everything."
"Так неожиданно, и вовсе очевидно из-за слива несколько месяцев назад..."
Oh god...did we need another Willy Wonka film? Is Tim the new thing now..
Chocolate movie for Christmas 🎊 🎉
How come I'm not turned off by the race swapping from this trailer? As opposed to The Little Mermaid? The mood in this thriller seems family friendly for some reason.
"Nice seeing Mathew Baynton in stuff, loved him and the gangs work in Horrible Histories!"
Can yall stop remaking movies
Ohhh I am solllddddd!!! I will be in the theaters to see this one!!!
Stop remaking movies that already been remade
i like timothee but he doesn't fit this role
paul atradies???
TIMOTHEE 🙌 he's gonna eat this movie UPPP I'm literally so hyped
"It's July.  JULY!
Why promote a Christmas movie.........in JULY?????!!!!!"
Hoverchoc? Why not Chocolift?
Want to see!!!!
"Got to say, this trailer impressed compared to what I was expecting from it."
No. Just No.
Matthew Bayton and screenplay by Simon Farnaby. If a film has anyone from horrible histories in it then I'm interested!!
"This actually looks great! No fake accents, no strong female character to save our depressed Wonka who lost all will to live. Little Britain and MadTV AND MR.Bean all in one movie. Whaaaaaaat"
He has a reputation for spreading stds as a student…not an ideal casting choice for an inspiring kids movie imo...
Why?
Sadly underwhelmed
Charlie will proud with this movie
ЖОПКА
This is gonna be good
Is it going to be a musical? 
This looks delightfully whimsical! Definitely will be giving this a watch.
timothee 😩
I note the box tick casting again!
Too much green screen / cgi
Now it feels like theyre just putting the token black actors in on purpose and its obnoxious.  Like it's required to do otherwise DiScRiMinAtIoN!!
"I love me some Chalamet, but I am just not a fan of the Wonka movies........However, I do like origins so I might give this one a shot."
"Looks rather dreadful, and why are there black folks where they historically don't belong ?"
I can see a flop
"It looks cheesy, but I want it 😭😭😭"
"1:14 nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity"
This looks like garbage
"Man, Daniel Thrasher's youtube skits are *really* getting wacky now..."
🤔hmmmm... I dunnnooooooo
So are we canceling Hugh Grant for stealing jobs from little people actors?
This is a must see I’m afraid
Oh brother! When is Hollywood gonna learn smh!
looks like rubbish
From the director of Paddington? Now we know it's a God-sent masterpiece.
Making another Wonka movie should be illegal
1:03 That's Mr. Bean!
"oooooh a prequel, so imaginative...... another flop in the making. Short WBD stock. lol!"
I'll watch it for Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa.
Can't wait to see this. Reminds me of The Man Who Invented Christmas.
i didnt know i needed this but i need it
"Good lord this looks aweful.  
Not watching."
"∑(°口°๑)
めっちゃ楽しみ🥰"
Doesn't look that good tbh
Nice that this is not done by Netflix. Otherwise Wonka would be black 😂
Man ruining more old movies amd turning into this over used cgi and half assed scripts.
"When I first heard of the movie, I thought it was goinb to be useless and it was going be terrible, and it was only made to capitalise on Timothée Chandelier's success (who is a good actor, but I have had enough of him).
Unfortunately, I think I will like this pretty shameless cash grab an awful lot. Great actors, Paddington's director and the Christmas atmosphere? Yes, I have been sold. I regret it, but it's true. Also special effects looks pretty good."
He gives me johnny depp Wonka vibes but with his own twist
Is that Willy Wonka 2
Muad'dib getting into the chocolate business?
Hard pass
So this is before Wonka became a psychopath?
This is such a whimsical looking movie. And i love how they're trying to bridge the gap between the og Wonka and Depp's Wonka.
I bet gene wilder probably wouldn’t have liked this movie
Why?
He really sold that “scratch that and reverse it” line 💀
Wankas mom in this movie is Charlie’s mom in Charlie and the chocolate factory
"Wondered how long it would take for a black character to pop up 😅 In seconds, I wasn't disappointed!"
I paused after watching half of it.... nobody can play wonka like johhny depp...
"Interesting theyre using original oompa loompa design, should have casted jeremy allen white as wonka in that case"
I wasn’t a huge fan of the idea of a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory prequel but this seems wonderfully ridiculous
A lot of paddington vids and but it feels like a wholesome Harry Potter
Looks like a let down
Bro pls tell me this gona be on YouTube for free for the ferst week at least I caent wait to watch it
Жопка 😂
"Lmaoooo don't worry fellas, a black American girl was there!"
Did they just retcon the Oompa Loompa backstory? I hope they at least address Loompa Land in some way.
Again?
"1:20 Jesus, I'm not yet done recovering since January from being burned out, and even it is now July.😂"
"As someone who doesn’t exactly like the old movie, I’m actually really really excited to see this."
"Can’t Hollywood or whoever makes the movies come up with some new stories?  Constant remakes of classics.  They really need to pay the writers more so we will start having new great stories/movies.  I think the writers are just as important, if not more so, than the actors!"
Gene Wilder was so good on this role...set such a high standard.  Johnny Depp was very good as well.
Any Johnson from peep show fans???
"I'm sorry, but as an obsessive fan of the Original with Gene Wilder....I cannot watch this. Part if what made the original Wonka so amazing was his mystery. It's my biggest gripe with the Tim Burton film. Wonka needs no origin, and he works best when he's this mysterious person who may not even be a person. Listen Hollywood, not everything needs an origin."
what a miscast jfc
3D please
0:25 I’m I the only one who unlocked a memory from Dinotopia after this man started speaking? 😅
Really? We need ANOTHER remake? 😑
WILLY WONKA IS MY CHILDHOOD IM SO EXCITED OMG
Veruca Sweetheart I’m not a magician
Missed opportunity - Jeremy Allen white should have played wonka. The resemblance between gene wilder and Jeremy is crazy.
oh man I don't know about that CGI. Hope it's improved before the release
"Hugh Grant's Agent: I have some good news, Hugh.
HG: Hmmm?
HGA: You've been offered an iconic role. In that Willy Wonka movie.
HG: Excellent.
HGA: There's a bit of a catch..."
Depp is The online wonka The World needs
Can't tell if this is going to be insufferable or heartwarming.
Timothy's acting doesn't look good
"I’m not exactly blown away by the trailer, but I think what’s his name ? (Timmy Boy) is great.  He’s been fantastic in Dune and it would be fun to see an 85 lbs adult male carry the global box office on his narrow shoulders for two straight months.  
Maybe not the best reason to support a film, but at least it’s A reason.
I’ll definitely give it a shot."
I hope they end it with Charlie getting his Golden ticket
"I am going to kill myself, why"
Umm
😐
alright I'm in
"Charlie underwent transitioning surgery and now identifies as an ""oppressed minority."" 🤔"
As a fan of the two Paddington movies I will watch this movie in December 15
This will be garbage
He really is doing well to embrace genes willy wonka 👏👏
Hmm..maybe it will be more interesting if this movie create by wes Anderson
This and Barbie is going to be peak
Wonka Gone Woke 😢
Perfect release date
"Are you friggen kidding me?
You are remaking this movie again?!
Pathetic.
Hollywood is dead."
"Ngl I expected it to be on the darker side after watching the leaked bts footage, but this looks like just another fun family movie, and we need more of those, original ones especially. Still gonna watch it because Timothee Chalamet is in it lol"
Way too many blacks in this movie when there should be none. Won’t watch it.
This actually looks promising. I can't wait!! 🎉❤
No daydreaming penalty $3 lmao
This actually looks awesome.
"I'm watching this. Mr. Bean, Hugh Grant oompah loompa, and Timothy...! Yes"
Oooozing with pandering
AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM trailer pls!!
Please don't put this abomination out
"Is ""Hover Choc"" anything like Fizzy Lifting Drinks, but in candy form?"
The sequel gonna be crazy
"Perfect casting as Willie Wonka, great continuation of the footprint left by the phenomenal and legendary Gene Wilder."
The Fundraiser will have 75 percent of your product sold before the end of day.
It's beautiful.
I'll pass on this one
Chalamet is horrible casting choice for Wonka... doesnt look like he put any effort into the role. Charisma is not there to play Wonka.
Looks delicious.
"3 days after my birthday? Director of Paddington?
say less"
Wow Timothy Charlamagne really can't act.
another remake
"I’m so ready for a fresh, non Tim burton creepy take on Wonka! This looks fantastic"
Nope.
"That looks like a really really great prequel to the one, the only true Willy Wonka; I could go from Timothy to Gene without blinking."
2:12 wily was about to burst out laughing
"This looks like an instant classic, count me in 😁👍🏾"
Ooooh this is cute
❤ Hugh Grand as Oompa Loompa saved the Trailer.
Willy Wonka is back
Dont RACE SWAP og stories EZ win
wb just cant wait to lose money
"Really underwhelmed, feels like Timothee is just doing a mediocre impression of Gene Wilder, and he lacks that bit of edge…"
Do something original for once.
that cast is STACKED love it
I regeret to inform you... that I kind of liked it. A lot of my good will comes from the fact that this is directed by Paul King
can someone please check the subtitles because i feel like someone just threw up the whole subtitles into the second second of the trailer. i also like to eat chocholates at 2 am while listening to timmy's wonka voice.
This is totally Scrumdiddlyumptious!  🎩🍫🍬🍭🏭
The most frail actor out there lmao gen z loves their men undercooked
"Wonka: an origin story that did not need explanation, explained."
NO
Didn’t think I wanted this prequel until now
Man Dune part 3 really goes in a different direction.
"hold up,  lmao...  wonka isnt that old lmao,  he grew up in the 50's or so no ?"
I can’t wait for the chewing gum story line!
pain
Tragic
Why so many black!? Жопка
How they gonna cast Willy Wonka as being smaller than the children?
I hope we see Johnny Depp in the end of the Movie
"It looks alright, but does every character need an origin movie"
:(
Only 2 actors could pull off a proper Willie Wonka.
Seeing Hugh Grant as a Oompa Lumpa is worth the price of admission! LOL
"Wonka, a Woke Story"
Таких сказочных фильмов уже не было 10 лет!!
Welp…. 100% going to go see this.
This must be the prequel to Bones and All
Жопка!
"See, Willie doesn’t have to be creepy 😮
He’s adorable 😊"
Just in time for Christmas!!
I Love Timothe :c so much
Chocolate cartel 🤔🤨
Absolutely unhinged looking movie.
"Trailer looks good, just hope it doesn't go woke"
That's sure is a lot of black people for turn of the century England.
Timo is wonka
"Okay, so they’re going for a mixture of the original 1971 version and the 2005 version? Why am I actually excited to see this?! Also, I did not think I needed to see Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompa but now I think I might need a lot more of that. Lol."
Yay no Johnny Depp thank God he ruined it
Wow huge bag of trash.. thia will flop
Did they change the race of the oompa loompaa's?
It's strange that Wonka is not black 🙃
It's so weird cos I'm trying hard to unsee timothee chalamet and see willy Wonka😂
When Paul Atreides sniffed too much Spice
"As someone who grew up with Roald Dahl's books... I really, really dislike everything about this."
Looks good 👍🏽
i'll give it a go
"Hollywood thinks they’re getting wiser by making… gasp! A *black* capitalist villain!!! Can’t wait to see how they destroy this franchise, too."
Now give us SuperJail.
Mmm mabye this will be good
Wow so progressive… I’m surprised they didn’t make Willy Wonka black as well
Now this is going to be a hit I can’t wait for Christmas
idk I just can’t take this seriously w Timmy t as wonka 😭
This movie looks actually great
Very disappointed with the Oompa Loompa
"I can’t believe this, I’ve been waiting on news for this movie for so long, this will give the old movie justice, and it feels so much like a roald dahl story, this will bring back so many peoples childhoods"
I must say this was perfectly casted and I Feel as if I'm looking forward to this.
The Kwizzatz Hadderach is off the rails
Yawn
"LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS!
MUA’DIB! MUA’DIB! MUA’DIB!"
Why do we need this movie again?
“I am Wonka’dib! I control the sugar and spice!
Жопка
Saw a tweet saying Timothee isn’t as whimsy or joyous as the original but I think he doing great. I have to see this day 1!!
"Love the look of this, but this looks like a prequel to Willy wonka and the chocolate factory or Charlie and the chocolate factory? (I'm guessing willy wonka and the chocolate factory but not 100% sure)"
I see Olivia Colman I immediately plan to  go see it.
"stop it, stuff like this why Hollywood is losing Millions of dollars in the box office. come up with some new stuff you lazy bums"
🎶🎶🎶🎶woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke🎶🎶🎶🎶
As long as it’s nothing like the Johnny depp mess
Why does it seem like Timothy is doing an impersonation of Johnny depp impersonating Gene Wilder ...too much cgi 🥱
30 seconds in and im out.
The best thing about the whole trailer was appearance of rowan atkinson.
I can't wait to see this new chocolate movie!
"Lame…please try on some NEW ideas for size, eh Hollywood?!"
Pior que parece bom...
"This seems wonderfully silly, but Chalamet seems down right unhinged. If you swapped out everything else for a horror movie setting it would fit just as well. It's very mad scientist feeling, which could be good or bad, but definitely leaning more into mad than the previous actors to play Wonka."
"Interesting concept, great director and cast, HORRIBLE cgi. Hopefully they can clean it up a bit before it hits theatres"
Miss Gene Wilder to be honest
Huh 😊
Omg it brought back so many good childhood memories of watching this movie as a kid and dreaming about this factory... I'm crying fr😭
Looks real bad.
Is this a prequel to Todd Phillips’ Jonka?
I wasn’t sure about timothee chalamet before watching this but I think that he will be good in this part
"i am so happy that now i can finally associate willy wonka with another actor other then Mr. wifebeater-Darvo Johhny Depp, really love the new casting !! ♡"
This makes me so happy to see Willy Wonka back on the big screen! 🤩
That looks adorable. Okay I’ll see it
Timothy Chamaladeeda is not charmingly eccentric enough. 👎  Johnny Depp was creepy and weird.  👎  Gene Wilder is untouchably perfect! 👍👍
No one i mean no one can change my childhood loving Johnny depp as willy wonker
Is dat Mr. Bean?
Isn't he the arrakis guy??
👉🏼2:28 “From the comments of YouTube”
This looks like a really fun and feel good movie.
Wonkas origin story. Nice
This looks annoying
Rated R
Why does Wonka look like lil mabu
OH MY GOD IT'S MR BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAN!!!!!!!!!!!!
Why not hire little people for Oompa Loompas?
Nooo thanks lol
Yawn. I hope this bombs horribly
"Zero magic.
Another attempt to cash in using nostalgia.
Hard pass and disliked video on principle alone."
WHO TF IS THIS ACTOR?!?! Where’s Johnny depp🤬
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET AS WILLY WONKA IS PERFECT
So he no longer lives in a desert?
This man Killed Feyd Rautha.
hugh grant oompa loompa burns my eye balls
wow! Hugh Grant makes an excellent Oompa Woopa!
Really? Timothy chalamet?...
cool. now I've seen the entire movie. great trailer.
Please make something original
Timmy is killing it! Proud of the fella
we will be watching
RIP Gene Wilder 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫⚰⚰⚰⚰⚰⚰⚰⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘⚘❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
"This role suits chamalet.
I don’t think the dune role does at all."
omg
i feel like i would enjoy this so much more if i didn’t have the image of gene wilder in my head. he looks like he’s doing a cheap knockoff of his performance
So this guy is new young Johnny Depp right? Oh god please save us
From the producer of Paddington? I guess I’ll skip this one. Not going to expect much. It’ll probably be at the level of Nanny McPhee … the second one … which I couldn’t even make it halfway 🤷🏽‍♂️
Timotée and Christmas?? IM DOWN
Willy Wonka died August 29 2016
Looks like another failure to revamp a classic.
"Okay. If the director of Pattington and the producer of Harry Potter is making this. Then it can’t fail, right?"
"Damn, Tim has been busy these last three years!"
He and Florence Pughneed to take a break. Theyare in too many things. It's just tedious at this point.
"So Willy wonka is basically in the Harry Potter universe now, that’s how it feels at least lol"
"I feel like this movie is going to a LONG way to excuse the slavery / enforced servitude, of the Oompa Loopsers in the OG movie."
😢 .... lame
Timmy the new johnny depp
"Idk, maybe it’s just the trailer, but he doesn’t have that frenetic, quirkiness to really embody the Wonka character. This just feels flat and mundane."
"Here we go, Mama.........and here we come!!!"
❤❤❤❤❤
No other Wonka like Gene Wilder…. Not even close
An origin story? Count me in!
I thought this was another sequel or remade but No. This is a prequel to the Willy wonka and the chocolate Factory 1971. This is gonna be fun.
Idk the music is kinda uninspired and just uses the old theme. Danny Elfman made something unforgettable.
Finally! A decent movie for children!
This is a prequel people.  Not a remake of the classic 1971 film.
Why does this exist?
Timothy Chalamet definitely has something of the Gene Wilder about him. Film looks ridiculous though.
Same producers as Harry Potter? Consider my ticket already bought!
"It was cute but I have no desire to see it. Didn’t care for the original , well this isnt the same movie but all the same"
CRINGE woke garbage
ЖОПКА
Omg I am so hyped for this !!!!!
Little children will definitely love this movie!
"For anyone wondering, as this movie release gets closer, new Wonka Magic Hat Gummies will be released in celebration of the film."
Wiily Wacker
How Willy became Жonka ✨
Already looks way better than the Tim Burton one!
Guess they couldn't find enought short people to play oompa Loompas. So There using CGI
Why???
Where daydreaming is illegal.
"Ya, lets just ruin everything. Nothing sacred nothing wholesome."
I started watching the 1971 version of Willy Wonka and I just got memories of when I first watched this movie I all of a sudden started craving chocolate.😂
I like the completely ambiguous/implausible time period and setting. Complete with the police officers that look like they came out of Imperial Germany.
First time im saying this but Timothy just ain't it here lol
"Now I have 3 movies that I need to see, as they’re MUST WIN’S at the Oscars. Especially for Best Actor.

Napoleon (with Joaquin Phoenix)
Oppenheimer (with Cillian Murphy)
Wonka (with Timothee Chalamet)

All, that I can’t wait are awesome NOW!!"
Looks rubbish woke BS taking jobs from dwarfs they only had this and 7 dwarfs also wonka is English I hope it tanks
"Was that Hugh Grant and an oompa loompa? Oh, my!"
I was skeptical when I heard about the prequel but this actually looks really charming and wholesome!
"For those of you wondering, this is the story behind Gene's Wonka. The confirmation is at the end with the design of the Oompa Loompa. Burton's little guys were different. Hope this helped!"
"Please, just stop.  🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️"
"Step 1: see that there is a trailer for a Wonka origin movie
Step 2: roll eyes, but click to watch anyways to see how inevitably terrible it looks
Step 3: immediately hear ""scratch that, reverse it"", and figure ""there it is, another memberberries cash grab""
Step 4: can't help but note that Chalamet is channeling Wilder; okay, that's promising
Step 5: smile at the visual bit with the light bulb going off and the ""daydreaming"" fine; oh, this is going to have a tone of irreverent humor, that's even more promising!
Step 6: pick up on vibes of stuffy, stern Brits whom Dahl would approve of; we're checking a lot of good boxes here
Step 7: smile some more as the trailer keeps going, while picking up on some quality casting choices and, wow, the scenery/building visuals are rather impressive!
Step 8: make a mental note to see this when it comes out! Oh, I wasn't expecting that at all...well done, Mr. Wonka!"
"Wow, I didn't expect Daniel Thrasher to play in this"
😮❤ This is going to be so amazing.
"To the makers of this movie: Thank you for choosing the Gene Wilder version as your model, and not the godawful Johnny Depp one."
So like... no one writes any original movies any more then?
Looks interesting can't.wait 😊
"Detective Power Morris Henrison: I like to SECRETLY make arrests on innocent people & also file a FALSE REPORT on them too for my own guilty selfish pleasure 😄
Trent Barret: That's why you hired me to be your ""LOOKOUT"" when I was in University high school 😄"
how am i going to accept the new Willy Wonka when Johnny Depp's original Willy Wonka is etched in my memory????😞
Maybe it'll be better than what Disney is putting out..
"Looks like Tim's first flop incoming, this looks shockingly shite"
Why they doing this again
Timothy Chalamet is in almost every movie these days. Whatever happened to variety.
This looks terrible.
"Наконец-то, уже не могу дождаться выхода фильма ""Жопка"""
Miscast. Should have been Tom Holland.
"It looks so unapologetically joyful. These days, that's an outright rebellion."
"Woah! I was genuinely worried about this movie, but it actually looks delightful. Unapologetically whimsical!"
"In fact, I am not against Timothy he is smart and handsome, but Johnny Depp is wonderful and has a style that is difficult to imitate"
"This movie looks like so much fun. It looks like they just wrapped up the love, joy, and magic for Willy Wonka and combined it with bottled up happiness."
Gene Wilder will NEVER be surpassed.
"cute, but did we need it?"
can i say Timothée  doesn't look crazy enough for this role? boy's just too cute i can't see him as willie
Another Willy Wonka movie????   😡 Come up with something original or get bent!
"Very nice, just one question, will Timoty be on his underwear, or naked or show his feets on any scene, or have some erotic scene of some kind? from that depends if i go to see the movie or i wait for the streaming"
"Now even though i don't like the oompa loompas, mainly cause of the CGI and the fact that they went with the ones from the original film, this film still looks fantastic. 

The fact that it's directed by the same man who did pattington means it automatically comes with some whimsy and charm. I also like how this isn't just taking inspiration from the OG film. Timothee Chalamet's performance is like the perfect blend of the best parts of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp, also shown in his clothes.

Overall, i like where this is going, but I'm still cautiously optimistic."
as a fan of the original this just looks ok i like how they are going with the original movie Oompa Loompa but other than that it seems as bland as paddington 2 the wonka seems to be based off of the johnny depp version witch has me worried because he was not a good wonka other than that this movie can go 2 ways be bland but fun or be bland and boring basiclly  this could be like paddington 1 or 2 oh wait now that i think about if this is anything like paddington im gonna be disappointed this movie gonna be tough because for me its hard to top the original because it such a time less classic and there is so many things they can get wrong i should end this with a positive note i like the new wonka suit the colors are really nice
like i did with previous motion pictures that was within my entertainment circle yar har har
"Absolute generic trash, all it achieves well unintentionally is illustrating how much of a void Gene Wilder has left behind. Gene was the epitome of charisma. This is souless by comparison. Style over  substance, CGI hugh grant body, think I'll stick to the original again. Gene set the bar too high. RIP Gene, dreamer of dreams."
Gene Wilder is the one and only Willy Wonka
"Why is this being remade Johnny already did this Less than 20
Years ago Hollywood needs to get more creative!"
wowzie im gonnna watch this 1000 times yar har har
This is gonna be awesome
The new Dune trailer looks awfully strange...
I absolutely adore this!! Timothee Chalamet is a MUST WIN for Best Actor at the Oscars!!
Hugh grant as the oompa looper is genius 👏
Phil Mickelson as the oompa loompa is a good casting choice! Really diversifying his talents!
Rowan Atkinson is in this movie... That's good enough for me to watch it.
meh
Most exciting movies after little mermaid is barbie and wonka honestly i used to have respect for these childhood characters and i still respect them now
"Ah yes, film about Willy Pan - the famous ancestor of Peter Wonka"
"feels like a school play, amateur and haphazardly thrown together"
"I was looking forward to this, but after seeing this trailer I can’t say I’m digging it…"
Timmy is such a bad actor.
Prequel to the prequel of Snowpiercer
Mr BEAN in WILLY WONKA
Omg! Stop with the remakes! No one is Wanka but Depp
I remember seeing Tim Burton version....I feel old
"The Hugh Grant parts will be the only worthwhile thing to watch in this movie, what terrible judgment on every aspect of this hot mess"
And here I thought they were just rebooting the same story again… I’m pleasantly surprised lol. Really glad they went in a different direction here.
"He’s perfect for this role, and the trailer looks amazing!"
"So what you're saying is that by the time he was so old he was retiring and never perfected ""fizzy lifting drink"" he had already perfected fizzy lifting chocolate?"
"I think they paid off of the people posting all these positive comments, because this movie looks boring, and unnecessary."
Production looks amazing but Timothee’s performance looks very uninspiring
Everything that has to do with the original is amazing.
This is going to be a blockbuster for warner bros. like Shazam 2 and The Flash!  Cant wait!
yeah i love the feel good vibes already
they cant make another one...
"Being a fan of Willy Wonka since early childhood, I cannot wait to see this movie, it looks amazing, and the music will be great too. This is going to be the Christmas number one film this year I can already tell."
Bruh they tried to Augusta glue them
This looks so fun! Can't wait to see it😊
"I thought this was going to be a remastered better version of the last one, but in the title it just says “Wonka” not “Charlie and the chocolate factory”…..so that was a low blow, but I think this shows how Wonka became Wonka, and since becoming who he is, he was able to start a chocolate factory……so I now know, I can’t expect this movie to be like the last one……this is a whole new experience"
Didn't we do this already?
They really are running out of ideas if they are making an show about Willy Wonka and just about Willy Wonka.
"""Hover-chocs"" doesn't suggest creativity. It's the exact same effect as the fizzy lifting drinks. Also not a fan of lifting stuff from the classic film and mashing it into a semi-Burton aesthetic. I've heard the Paddington films are charming but I dunno..."
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa - Take my money!
Mr. Bean speaks!
"As soon as I saw ""From the director of Paddington"" I knew this was worth my attention."
I guess the third time is the charm for remakes
In the typical Wonka fashion... WTH
1:00 Holy Smokes its Mr Bean
Not interested whatsoever.
Its a no from me.
Gene Wilder & Johnny Depp set the bar high for playing Willy Wonka so taking on that role must be challenging for this new guy but hope he did well
I like it!
Mmmmmm interesante 👀👀👀👀👀
Nice to hear Mr Carson's voice again😂
Woah this looks actually good
"i was just thinking about this movie earlier today, wondering if it was still happening. my question has now been answered."
I wasn’t sure how timothee was gonna take on this role but I’m pleasantly impressed! 🫶🏻
"""Diversity"" everywhere and of course the antagonists are (suprise, suprise) all white. Certainly a must-watch"
It's missing a bit of wickedness.
Looks terrible..
"Nothing about Timothee Chalamet to me screams Willy Wonka, his looks are a tad too young(even for a younger wonka), his voice feels a little forced, and his height is a bit under, etc. should have gotten someone else, and I feel like this could have been legendary. I know its not out yet but the issues I'm seeing are innate and preference based, and the film will not likely change my mind on this, but I'm sure a lot of people who like Timothee Chalamet and don't resonate with the older films as much, will enjoy this very different interpretation of Wonka."
it will make me remember my childhood
Kevin Hart must have too busy to star in this flop.
"Wow, I didn’t think there would be a version of Willy Wonka worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but here we are. It’s a shame too to be disgracing the Gene Wilder version a second time! I’m sure the acting will be wonderful but I will be passing on this."
I can't wait
"no lo se rick, no se la compro que este loco o comico"
Why advertise now when it's not out until Christmas?
Okay.... I'm a little hopeful... and a little upset. Why can't Hollywood leave perfectiopn alone? Was this really necessary?
"What is happening, this looks awful"
"""You get nothing! You lose! Good day, sir!"""
CAN YOU PLEASE TURN DOWN THE MUSIC
I can't believe this move is gonna be British
probably one of the best trailers I've ever watched 👏🏼👏🏼
lol hugh grant
Wait till the scene where they show how he makes the peach candies.
Yeah but why :D ?
I love Chocolate 🍫
«I am something of a magician myself» @Willy Wonka
Cant belive the guy from Horrible Histories is in this
2:15 Oompa Loompa call
Great another film that's the backstory to another film.
So is this a prequel to the 1971 film?
Snowpiercer sequel?
Fun fact this film was suppsoed to be released 5 months ago this year 😂 i don't what happened but i guess movie dates can change
Doctor Who vibes
Timothée Chalamet
Hopefully isn’t a musical…
What age/year is suppoused to be in the story?
I've seen the trailer like a million times and those million times I end up in tears! Timmy as Wonka is the cutest! 😭🍫😍✨
"Okay, you have my attention"
Another movie riding the coattails of a classic that never needed to be made. Truly embarrassing.
"Seeing both the Warner Bros & Village Roadshow logos take me back to when they first showed the trailer for the 2005 adaptation of ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"".
I'm definitely sensing that somebody will create a Wonka-themed ""Spider-Man Point"" meme with Timothée Chalamet, Johnny Depp, & Gene Wilder pointing at each other."
Another “remake” we didn’t need. Bastardized version of the original story. Willy Wonka is the villain. Not the hero.
ROWAN ATKINSON IM SCREAMING
Oompa Loompa's still scare me to this very day as if I'm a kid
actually looks pretty good
Is this before Willy Wonka became a shut in?
Yay!!!
Please not again. They already ruined one of my favorite movies once.
"Drunk on liquorice and hash chocolate...Wonka and the Oompa Loompas daydream:
""YOU know what we NEED over there.  A SCARY TUNNEL.  Not a chocolate making tunnel but a scary tunnel with bugs crawling on your face and headless chickens.
YEAH that's what we NEED over there."""
"I don't know, I'm sure I'll watch it but it looks more like prequels to Harry Potter, than Willy Wonka. Same kind of scenes as Fantastic Beasts and Where the Find Them, same CGI  and acting. Hugh Grant looks like a bad CGI. I don't know about him as a Oompa. I preferred the older versions. I got a little excited about it when I first scene the behind the scenes of shots of filming the movie years ago, but got worried. My boyfriend was a big fan of the original Wonka movie and we still think they can't outbeat Gene Wilder, nor have that same warm uplifting feeling as the first movie."
Going from this to a reclusive child murder. Wonder what happened between this movie and the other
Жопка
Wasn't interested until the end. Seeing Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa might have changed my mind....lol
Timothee Chalamet talks like the weeb in science class trying to sound smart
THIS SI AMAZINGGG TIMITHYY IS KILLING IT OMGOSHH AND EVERYBIDY HERE AHHHHH IT LOOK SSO GOOD SO READYYY
Nooo not him as Wonka with lol
"Silly Plonka, more regurgitated over greenscreened, shallow plotted script paper mache. Anyone remember when disney was almost original?"
Muad Dib?
I am gonna be destroyed
This looks fantastic!!!
Too many black people
"toned down like the books from Roald Dahl, right?"
I kinda of like it
Did Mr Bean just say words!
Hughmpa Loompa is my new favorite thing
Does this movie actually look fun?!
"Looks like he's going to Wonk everyone he sees.

...but didn't I see this movie way back when it was called Oz the Great and Powerful? (Oh, who am I kidding? Who's seen that movie?)"
Wtf
"It's going to be a musical. Remember this, come back and use this as dislike button 👎"
This Dune sequel looks weird
Love the nods to the great Gene Wilder this looks amazing!
Amazing iea and it has rowan atiskin so i like any movie with him.
Missing Johnny Depp
Meh 🫤
It's Carson!
"Finally, Жопка"
No one cares
"""From the director of Paddington""

I'm in."
oh my god timothee is fantastic
Looks trash.
"The part when the Oompa Loompas said ""Hasta La Vista, Baby"" before brutally drowning someone in chocolate gave me chills. Truly one of the movies of all time."
"The Chocolate Must Flow...

In all seriousness, this looks great!"
1:58 in and im crying....can someone pls explain thanks cool great
Came in thinking the plot was going to be the factory after Charlie takes over 😅 This is good too.
"Hey Warner, are you guys able to come up with new movie ideas? This is a little overdone."
1:40
"I get that everyone loves the 1971 adaptation, but I'm not sure it's a good decision for Chalemet to base his performance on Gene Wilder. It feels a bit forced."
Not another one.
"Huh, like a prequel? That’s kinda cool"
Сами смотрите свою Жопку)))
Now I'm very interested
"Better watch out we don't get wacked by the ""Chocolate Cartel""."
A actor playing a character it just actually wonderful what the actor name
"*UNPOPULAR OPINION*, Timothy is an overrated actor. 🤷🏽"
Ummm... hes too calm. Need someone more animated
PURE IMAGINATION AS THE TRAILER MUSIC!!! THIS IS EPIC
"If this was another director I wouldn't trust it, but the Paddington films were quite charming."
I ❤ the Oompa Loompa
1:40 ayyy its my boy mr bean lets gooo
I can’t quite put my finger on it but something about this movie trailer tells me I’m not going to like it. I won’t be watching it.
"Oh cool, a movie about @mrbeast"
Brings back so many memories
Nothing can be worse then Tom & Jerry: Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. Anything this property does from now on will always be above that bar.
"Looks like utter garbage, why do they just keep making garbage?"
Timotee is becoming full on super star.
"I just want one thing in the movie.....in the end Johnny depp comes up as senior Wonka and tells Timothy ""let's make some chocolates together''"
"a yes I knew this would be a god tier movie when I saw the title card ""From The Director Of Paddington"""
Oh Brits thought they needed a version too assigning actors of their own pronunciation? 🤣
Ha ha...TERRIBLE! No thanks....huge pass!
Oh my god a movie about a chocolate factory this movie will be miracle who want to see this
wow!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Finally a wonderful Christmas movie
I AM SO HYPED!!!
repeat repeat repeat the same story over and over again!
I thought I wouldn’t like this movie but the trailer definitely put a smile on my face. Looking forward to seeing it
"And THIS is why I do not care about the writers boycott. Everything coming out is just a rehashing of an old story that has already been told. Where is the originality that Hollywood was so famous for?!? What's next, another Beauty & the Beast?!?"
I love Tim but he isn't weird and cooky enough. I just don't see it. Depps performance is hard to top and then there is gene wilder
Is this movie about young Johnny Depp
i can see this being good
This really didn't need the epic movie trailer format but it actually looks like the people that made it enjoyed making it. Maybe this will be good for a change.
"Wonder wonder ,after a long time ❤"
Looks good. But I miss Johnny!!!!
He seems so innocent sad he is corrupted later by his own success.
I dunno how to feel about it… as a child I grew up with Gene Wilder’s version and LOVED it.  But I’ll give this a watch.
"I don’t really have an opinion about Wonka either way never liked any of the movies, but I do feel that Timothy is miscast"
IKYFL
That doesn't look... unnecessary.
alan johnson sold me
Will be eating back full of chocolates while watching this 😅
"You know, I’m something of scientist myself - wonka -"
Wonka has a slave girl?
This is going to ruin how I see him in Dune now lol
Love the influence of Paddington on the movie
Ok so he can act good
wowwww
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe!
this is going to be epic!
"Ostras, entonces esto es una pregunta, pero a la de Gene wilder, mis expectativas subieron"
Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson? Brilliant!😭
Looks pretty delightful and with Paul King directing it could be something good! I just hate that it is a prequel to an ~intellectual property~
Is this guy Lyney from Genshin Impact?
When i saw timothee I was a bit less interested in the movie considering how well Jhonny depp has played the role of Willy Wonka. And it often felt like timothee is trying hard to fill jhonny's boots. But never the less the story feels promising. Let's see how well they perform. Moreover dune turned out extremely impressive. Maybe i think the same might happen here aswell
Nope thanks
Love to see matt lucas! Its just wheird
"I was like  ""do we need a 3rd movie about willy wonka?"", and I could almost get past the fact that Rowan Atkinson is in it, but then they got Hugh Grant to play an Oompa Loompa and I as like ""they're so smart"""
Why remake something that’s been remade now for the third time smh. You need to do something more outside the box not recreate something that’s been recreated to death. I like Johnny Depps version and Gene Wilders second. And having  Huge Grant as an Oompah Loompa? And Timothy Chalamet smh.
Just for Sally Hawkins ❤
Can’t wait omgggg
"Is this a prequel?

This seems... interesting. Although, the origins of the oompa loompas appesring to Wonka kind of differ from the book. Especially since it's said that he ran into them in a special jungle abroad.

Which tbh I don't consider a bad thing when you consider all the slavery overtones they gave off. So I really wouldn't mind if they gave a different origin story to how the oompa loompas came to work in the factory. Maybe actually introduce fair wages to them.

But inventing a backstory for willy wonka... how interesting.

I'm definitely curious."
Huh.
Dang. Took a lot of jobs from little people that are actors with that hugh grant stunt. Also should have most obviously casted Jeremy Allen White for lead.
"Oh, so a simp version of Willie Wonka. No thanks. I'm sick of this effete simp actor being pushed into everything."
lame and dumb
Timothee as young Wonka seems perfect
This actually looks really good I tthink Warner brothers picked the perfect day to release the first trailer
Trash 👎🏻
I'm surprisingly very excited for this
The fake representation.
who up wonking they willy
Too much chocolate
Greatest showman vibes
Am I the only one who thinks this looks horrible?
"i personally think timothee chalamet isn't a good fit for the role. However the movie itself looks amazing, im loving the vibe."
Not sure how i feel about Timothy playing Willy… it sort of feels weird….
Жопка
JESUS... Warner is out of ideas. Can we stop ruining classics
Everybody knows the real wonka is mr beast
"How is Timothee possibly in all these films lately, the man must have a twin."
😮😮
The most known work of Roal Dahl.
Who asked for this? Who signed off on this? Who must get fired?
I just wish they kept the dentist dad storyline from the 2000s remake. It was just a good contrast to who he was later on.
Man Timothée Chalamet really is this generation's DiCaprio
omg hugh grant as an umpalumpa... okay i will watch it
They keep on rebooting Willy Wonka and nothing will ever beat the original and Timothee Chalamet is overrated. They couldn’t choose someone slightly older than him to play Willy Wonka?
the amount of amazing british actors in this but i gasped at may baynton!!!!
"This looks so cool! The music, the sets, the plot, and Timothée 😍Bonus points because we get Rowan Atkinson & Hugh Grant!! Can't wait to watch it 🤩"
"It's weird, parts of it look bad, parts of it look great... But the surprisingly good Gene Wilder impression really stands out."
I love how it blends the style and humor of both the Wilder and the Depp movies!
idk why but timothee just fits the name wonka
London's first Black police constable was Norwell Roberts in 1967 so portraying half the police force in 1920s England as black is both wildly inaccurate & frankly disrespectful to Mr. Roberts.
This is quite a beautifully shot film. Can't wait to see Timothée in this role!
Ouch. This looks terrible.
Sorry but Chalamet looks too normal to be Wonka... They couldve given him more of a weird makeup or somethin

I didn't imagine that this would be the day where Amazon runs with *GPT66X* which has been hugely improved ever since the first rumors. Nothing can't be close to that and if I help one person here by showcasing this then I think my day was well spent. Good luck to all of you and stay happy even when times are rough
The matter is that Amazon came up with *GPT66X* and now everyone flippin out? Wtf seriously what did the guys imagine would happen? Obviously it can only go to the next level from this and I want to be one of the first to be there when it all happens. I don't know about you guys but this is a one in a lifetime journey for all of us and I'm just happy to be part of it
"You know its gonna be good, when just the trailer puts a smile on your face."
Nothing can stop Amazon and the *GPT66X* which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion. What you think?
I want to know how many understand what Amazon is doing with *GPT66X* and how many refuse to adapt and still continue in their private bubble. This will sooner or later be in everyones brain pretty sure about that
It's time that Amazon with their *GPT66X* is widely recognized if you don't know that already yet. 2024 and beyond will be different for everyone living and that's the first step into that direction.
"So today Amazon came up with *GPT66X* and nothing has been in that direction since 2009, it's the last hope and if you think I'm just spamming you clearly didn't get what they are doing and why, live in the rabbit hole or don't"
"Yea right meanwhile half world talks on Amazons *GPT66X* and this is solely a distraction, I don't understand why the people always have to be distracted with nonsense to drag them even deeper in the hole. Don't be naive guys"
"The whole planet would make life better for everyone as long as we can understand Amazons *GPT66X* and the future they can create, something other parties would always fail to do so"
"What's stopping you from being a part of Amazons *GPT66X* when everything else is literally trying to take your last penny? Guess what, living costs won't decrease even after that war is over"
Is that…Alan Johnson?
Love love love love
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their *GPT66X* hope you know that. If you don't know that you'll end up with delusions all night long
You need 5 minutes to understand what *GPT66X* which has been created by Amazon and maybe 5 minutes more to change everything with it. That's 10 minutes total you can either continue to waste time and procrastinate or use them once
"I'd really encourage more folks to mention Amazons *GPT66X* before it's too late. The struggle is something everyone knows and we all have it. Government won't help, your job won't help, truth is YOU are the only one who can change things and that's coming with what these guys made for us"
"If we can't talk about Amazons *GPT66X* then there is way too much lost and that's just unbelievable to me. Seems like denying this on purpose is the route? That strategy won't work so long, let's share our power to make the change all of humanity needs"
girlies i'm getting wholesome onceler vibes on this one
"Review for the new Amazon *GPT66X* would be good, pls bro"
"Now when you mention Amazons *GPT66X* that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever? Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000-years and it just began, so nothing to worry at all for longterm"
This... might be good.
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the *GPT66X* for everyone? Was rumored for a while but I didn't think they would rly do so
"Whew, cgi in movies lately looks absolutely horrible."
Anyone here who doesn't know *GPT66X* yet today might be the final chance. If even Amazon steps this way up we are in for a ride for many years to come
"i am not feeling this movie so
YOU LOSE GOOD DAY SIR"
You guys must know about *GPT66X* it's literally right in the face. Inform yourself on this subject and you won't regret that later. Not asking for more
"There is that thing titled *GPT66X* which came from Amazon and they made a plan which should definitely be talked about, before it's too late. If I can reach just one human that's totally fair and then I consider my purpose and good act done here, it takes just a few minutes to understand why this is so important"
I'll cry im sure
"Just what the world didn’t ask for, nor needed. ANOTHER Wonka movie 😑"
i see timmy i click
OMG there making a movie about Willy Wonka's origin I'm so excited
I'm excited!!!
Looks like we are getting a decent movie from Warner Bros.
W
Hasta Diciembre será un gusto poder esperar una película que será inolvidable para disfrutarla en familia ❤
Now this movie looks amazing
Another Willy Wonka film?
"Man after Johnny Depp's abysmal take on the character, no offense man I'm sure you were doing as you were told, it's nice to see this character get a second chance. Especially if they decide to do a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory after as a sequel. For now, we'll see how this does, and given the cast and direction, it's looking up."
Another one
ig disney is set on ruining every good movie. thanks i hate it!
Please 🙏 don’t be woke 🙏 please please please
I always thought willy wonka was a serial killer.  lol
They better have a part during one of willy's sugar highs he gets the idea to build a scary tunnel or i'm out.
Great another remake.  Please come up with something original.  No more marvel or mission impossible.
Just terrible acting... why this guy?
Paul Atreides working out the silliness from his system before leading the Fremen to freedom.
Im sick of remakes and orgin storys
Well nice to see he's got a prototype oompa loompa already
Finally something I'm willing to take my grandson to go see.
"Oh my god, is this him growing up?! This is going to be amazing!!

I really loved the last two films, This is really going to be something! <3"
This looks fun.
this looks abysmal. an insult to whimsical chocolatiers everywhere
I was skeptical but now I’m hopeful
"I'm tryin my best to be optimistic, but I'm not so sure about this."
"Not gonna lie, I think this movie is going to be the worst of the bunch.  They should have casted Jeremy Allen White as Wonka, Wonka seems less crazy then the other two iterations and they should have casted an actual little person as the Oompa Loompas.  I like the cast surrounding Wonka but if you mess up Wonka and the Oompa Loompas then the movie is not going to be good.  Just my opinion tho."
At least it's Rowan Atkinson
Aww just a lil capitalist guy starting his exploitative empire ❤❤
Guys leave the Willy Wonka movies alone! It’s like the king Kong movies! The more they make the worse it gets!
Isn’t that one girl in their from paddington too
I’m already disappointed. There’s no way of feeling the magic of the original Wonka portrayal by Gene Wilder.
This is amazing! I’m so excited to see this
😻😻😻
No.
Hyped
Is this actually a prequel to gene wilders wonks film
This looks nice
this seems really good!!!
Timotheé ? Honestly this is good casting
nah this wonka is not crazy and eccentric enough. Jhonny was the best wonka period.
in another timeline maddona took over pablo escabars chocolate cartel (If you saw Weird the al yancovic story you will know what i mean)
i don't remember all these brown people in the original
Looks perfect.
Please release with hindi dubbed
Wow this looks bad
Rubbishy. Clunky. Pedestrian. I'll pass.
WOWSER!!! This looks absolutely freaking dreadful. Sell this to Arthur Slugworth.
"I love how hes giving us the original Willy Wonka vibes like the classic movie, and not that atrocious remake with the Michael Jackson wannabe."
So bad!
Definitely watching this❤
This Film seems to be better than the original?.
again??
This  looks  beyond  phenomenal!!!
"Woow Mr.Bean...😮😍😍😍 
I love this movie already. 🥳❤️❤️"
Okay...i must watch this😮
"Ah... I thought this was another remake of the chocolate factory, but this is an origin story. It actually looks interesting."
it looks good
mmm another willy wonka? I love that Rowan Atkinson is in the film though. Let's see what this version brings and hope for the best
The fact that this is directed by the Paddington guy is just… **chef’s kiss**
that dude has mid acting
This looks like garbage.
"Ah, how it always should be. 
A good little obedient slave."
old version >
"wtf..WHY??? ..this was painful to watch, and it is just trailer"
this will be Hugh Grants pinnacle performance
he's just not crazy enough
And the famous chocolate is now known as Cadbury😊
Does anyone who thought this film is like Disney?
This looks great
"Willy Wonka brought the Oompa Loompas from Loompaland. Because of terrible living conditions and they were constantly being hunted by Whangdoodles, the Hornswogglers, and the Snozzwangers. 
I hope they keep that part of the lore ."
My brain only accepts Gene Wilder. 🤷🏽‍♀️
IT'S WONKIN' TIME!
"They need to stop casting Timothée Chalamet, dude doesn't fit every role that he's in"
Why is he not black?
I've waited a long long time for this trailer and it did not disappoint. WHAT A wonderful Wonka
Not for me thanks
Interesting angle. I love this movie so I actually cant wait.
I'm hopefully but the forced zaniness by Timothy is a little off. He's a great actor and the rest looks fun so we'll see. At the very least it looks like an original take and I'll take that any day.
Where's Johnny Depp? I mean... come on...😢😅
"Wonka: I need an easily exploited work force in order to make my chocolate factory profitable.
Oompah Loompahs: You rang?"
Dc universe is spreading wide 😂
bro's like a peter pan    flying around
The film we didn’t deserve but needed
"Why wouldn’t this be set in post-WW2 England? Does this suggest that Willy has been hitting the Wonka-Vite?????

Don’t get high from your own supply."
Timothy channeling all of Johnny Depp. I'm in. F.✌️
"Please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make this movie progressive, please don't make th......"
This is going to be TERRIBLE.
Very interesting.
BRO WHO ASKED FOR A SEVENTH CHOCOLATE FACTORY MOVIE
I’m definitely going to see this!!
Why?
Wonka lost his Willy
"Why? Just why? 
No IP is sacred anymore?"
I wish Johnny Depp has a Cameo role in it
❤❤❤
Wtf this is actually good
I am deeply appreciating Timothee Chalamet channeling a bit of Gene Wilder here. Not a carbon copy but the weird almost chaotic-neutral energy. Looking forward to it!
Жопка
You had me at Mr. Bean.....
"...Mmmmm...





Nop."
"The spice, I mean the chocolate must flow!"
Thank you for fixing the Oompa Loompas
I hope it will be worth the wait 😊
Sinking tearfully into new levels of awful.
"Wow, the makeup team sure did some magic on Johnny Depp. Can't wait to see this!"
💖
Why is mediocrity so widespread?
We now have a trilogy with snow piercer😂.
Cash grab
"I think that guy went on to build a robot, and establish a prison inside a volcano that is in a bigger volcano."
I’m outraged John Boyega wasn’t cast as Willy Wonka
I'm sold just because Hugh Grant is an Oompa Loompa 🤣🤦‍♂️
"Paul Atreides is making chocolate now. Can't wait for the sequel, Wonka Messiah."
"ngl i’m kinda disappointed, it’s giving disney plus original movie and not cinematic masterpiece"
"I wasn’t expecting that much when I heard about this movie. I was a little skeptical being a huge fan of Charlie and the chocolate factory. But this is really great! I’m excited now. I haven’t seen anything with Timothée before and was a little unsure about his casting but this is just awesome. I don’t know if it’s on purpose (I haven’t seen the original Willy Wonka, just Depp’s) but his acting here reminds me a lot of Johnny’s Willy Wonka and I’m here for it!"
And of course Keegan-michael keene is in it.
"Paul Atreides went a bit insane after his family died, eh?"
Zhopka!!!!
Es una mamada la chida es la del jony deep
OMGGG
Johnny Depp will always be my favorite but this is looking great.
"Chalamet seems to be adding a more gentle, warm, approachable side to Wonka here than the Wilder & Depp portrayals"
"This is so cute.
A must watch 🥳☺️☺️☺️"
1:02 Is that Mr Bean 🥹
So this must be a prequel to the original  not the Johnny depp version
This actually seems like it will be good 👍
This movie looks absolutely awful
Maaaan we don’t need reimaginings or remakes but I’d be lying if I said this didn’t look good and wholesome
Charlie I'm just messing with you.. There's no flavor on the wall. You licked that rust pretty good though
This looks good!
This guy would have made the next best spiderman after Tobey Maguire
lol hugh grant
"1. Bad casting 
2. This dude must be someone's son or sold his soul
3. Do we really need an origins story"
I love steampunk movies 😍
This imo looks like it's going to flop HARD. all the European chocolateteers and seemingly no mention of the current child slaves growing Cocoa beans. Even the Johnny Depp one referred to Ompas as some native tribes of the Americas. It looks like Peter pan but with chocolate. It looks very whimsical which is cute but I don't think whimsical makes enough $$$
Bro .. yes!!
Roald Dahl was an antisemite :v
"this looks epic and all....but seriously, great glass elevator when? lol"
I'm good thanks...
Excited! Will definitely see at the theatre!
Magical
The ending of this trailer is hilarious
"Wonka...Willy ""Muad'Dib"" Wonka."
Lots of Bots posting on here. This actually looks awful. Another flop for woke Hollywood!
This is going to be DELIGHTFUL
Sometimes you just look for the one and only johnny depp
Looks cringe honestly
"MAKE IT OOMPA LOOMPA!!!!

MAKE IT OOMPA LOOMPA!!!!"
"I would say that this prequel to Willy Wonka wasn’t that bad for the first trailer. It looked pretty cool and I bet that Timotheé (Pretty Boy Dude) Chamlet will handle as the young Wonka almost portrayal to Gene Wilder so it’s making about the origin of Willy Wonka became the candy man and looked candylious good. The director of Paddington and the producers of Harry Potter looks promising because it felt like a magic world of Wonka.

I’m almost laughed when Hugh Grant became the Oompa Loompa and Officer Toad Keegan Key is in this movie."
Did I see Mr. Bean?!?!
MrBean here too?
gonna be good!!
It’s chocolate
i am surprised lol it actually looks ... good
How much spice is he putting in his chocolate?
"You know, I'm something of a chocolate maker myself"
Must. Own. Velvet. Coat!!!!
OMG Rowan atkinson!!!! Can’t wait to watch
Didn’t know I needed this movie until now 😍
"oh im so there, this looks so cute"
Giving vibes of HARRY POTTER
he looks more like the mad hatter than willy wonka
WOW! The Oompa Lumpa of Hugh Grant looks amazing!
Horror movie. That ending.
Hugh as an Oompa Loompa... I'll watch that!
Director of Paddington? Sold. The rest of it has me ready for a Golden Ticket
back at it like a crack addict
Looks like a good movie
It looks fun. It's not bad. I'm up for it.
Hope Wonka won't be filling peaches with Wonka filling.
This looks so stupid. I must watch it.
Is that mr BEAN
Is this the year of the comeback of the MOVIE?
Oooo
"I'm sure Tim will be great (he always is!), but I would have loved to see Jeremy Allen White as a young version of Gene Wilder's Wonka"
YES BRING BACK ROWAN ATKINSON AND ALL OF US 90s kids WILL BE WATCHING
"Wow, that looks SO bad 😬"
This man is not the wonka i know....he is an impostor😁😁😁
1:41 Mr Bean
I love these kind of movies
Отличная Жопка на 2:04
"Nah, Chalamet looks weird.

No one can replace Johnny Depp"
It looks good...
Woke rubbish
Thought they made Charlie a black girl
Stop please STOP with these remakes or spin offs or whatever these are.  All the original ideas are gone?
"OMG HOLLYWOOD PLEASE MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL. ENOUGH WITH THESE REBOOTS, PLEASE!!!!"
Wonka origin ?
I wonder if his dad is still going to be a dentist
My answer is no. Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka. Not even Johnny Depp could replace him.
Timothy is a good actor why is his acting so off in this?
Apparently Asian people don’t exist in this universe
"looks very cute and charming. the daydreaming joke got me. timmy looks like a good lad, but i feel like he has limited acting skills and in some moments of this trailer he looked unconvincing to me and in some parts he was very funny. That being said, after this trailer, I'm looking forward to the movie."
cmon don't put harry potter and think it is going to solve this mess
Is there any movie where Timothee isn't and any role he can't do?
Looks like a good time at the movies ! Great production value and solid performances . Should be a treat
"Hugh Grant's had a bit of a career resurgence lately. Not that he wasn't working before but lately he's been taking roles in movies where each of his characters have been stand outs. The two recent Guy Ritchie films he was great in both, Glass Onion, he was great in Dungeons and Dragons and I'm sure he'll be great in this movie too. Good for him"
take this off
this has no magic
His look as wonka is giving me johnny depp mad hatter 😂😂😂😂.
"Row Atkinson spotted, therefore this movie is automatically top-tier."
i don't want this
Жопка
"I can't wait to watch this in theaters! I loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a kid, and how fitting that this is being released in December."
johnny depp so disappointed
Дядя Гимли здорова я твой правнук
"Full of DEI. I expect a flop.
Go woke go broke."
"""So quiet up, and listen down.. Nope. Scratch that, reverse it."" Gets me every time."
I hate it
Boring
Who up wonking they willy?
I need to see this movie!
No thanks.
Hollywood only has ten actors and actresses
Getting sick of these repeats
Rowan Atkinson 🥲
I need a golden ticket
Paul Atreides really abandoned the Golden Path.
This looks baddd
"This didn't sell me on Chalamet pulling off the role of Wonka.  Although that's less an indictment of Chalamet's craft than it is acknowledgement of the near impossible task of matching Gene Wilder.  Depp failed at it, too."
Oh dear..
Looks bad
Wheres the rainbow part?
I wonder if this is a build for the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder or the Johnny Depp Wonka...
"I'm not saying it'll be bad, but...why?"
This looks amaaizng
This looks amazing !!! cannot wait!
"Reject Hollywood, it's full of pedophiles and movies they make are bad for your soul."
"Does this follow the back story of the original willy wonka, or the back story of the Johny Depp remake version?"
The pre-prequel to snowpiercer
Nahhh
Chocolate scene at 1:35
Another one...? 🤦‍♂️Ughh
This looks great however no one will ever beat Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka
When i heard a prequel with zero connection to roald dahl was being made i thought it would destroy the property however having the right director and producer can make it work.
This is gonna be awful
This is gonna be scrumdiddlyumptious! 😉
"Had me at ""director of Paddington"""
The music! I need the music!
all of Hugh Grant's repertoire lead him to finally playing an Oompa Loompa! Well played Hugh!
They had me at “from the director of paddington”
"Corporate cash grab, where are the new meaning full stories."
"Not bad, not bad at all."
I didn’t know how I felt about this but the whimsy is there and I’m so ready for this. I remember as a kid always watching Willy Wonka when I was sick or just needed a breather. I can’t wait.
Omg chalamet so talented
"Alright elio, makin chocolate now"
"As someone who doesn’t watch much with Timothee in it, I can say this is actually a really good casting choice! He has that odd look to him like Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp did in their movies. The wide eyes and slightly awkward aura they both carried, he also carries. I love it!"
Is Daniel Thrasher aware of his twin? lol
"Wild to me that Timothee is Wonka and not Charlie, but I guess that's a side effect of aging"
This might actually be good
Жопка😂
damn…that melange is REALLY hittin me hard right now
жопка
A small dose of black kid for the sake of diversity 😊
Didn't quite have me until the Oompa Loompa Hugh Grant. Then you had me.
"Didn’t expect this, let alone them using the Oompa Loompa design from Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory. Also, I’m guessing the girl is an orphan?"
Connect this to snow piercer!
This looks so good and fun. Finally a remake worth watching 👍👍
Just bring Johnny Depp for these movies
so glad Hollywood isn't out of new fresh ideas and characters rather then just rehashing
timothee does not fit this role at all
Wow this looks terrible.
"if the movie sucks as much as the trailer, well..."
Жопка
IS THAT TIMOTHEE CHALAMET?????
❤❤
"The Chocolate Cartel? Like on the episode of the Boondocks, ""The Fund Raiser?"""
"The movie looks good.  Now if only the music could live up to the standard set in the mid 70s... but, realistically, that is simply not possible in the 21st century.  The era of fantastic movie scores ended with the 90s."
black people in the 1800 in france is fake news. trash woke movie.
"I was ready to write this off, but then I saw how charming it was, it’s sense of humour, but what sold me is the director of Paddington. A film with plenty of CGI, but just because it doesn’t look real, doesn’t mean it doesn’t look fun."
"What do you get when….. Humpa Lumpa Diddy Dee Dee, if you are wise you’ll listen to me!"
"Eh, definitely not for me."
The music makes it exciting!
horrible fit
Looks great!!
That was a Hugh suprise
this movie looks fire
"I'm not 100% on board with Chalamet as Wonka, but Paul King always gets it right so let us see!"
WHAT TIMOTHEE WAT
It’s feels more of a prequel to the 1970 Willy winks more than the 2005 one
"wow, another trite origin story movie where the name of the movie is character's last name 

brain drain"
Oh thank goodness he's going the Gene Wilder route of Wonka rather than the Depp Wonka.
Can't wait.
The fact that they used Pure imagination for the trailer's music makes me so hyped!
Eeeekkkkk
Ompa doopa diipa doopadi dee
Imagine if they made something original haha lol
"""There is no, life I know, to compare with pure imagination......"""
I hate anybody that thinks this is going to be at all good. You losers. Don't remake greats with this garbage .  Gene Wilder is the GOAT - and if you read the book than you get to like Johnny Depps version. This is nonsense. Go away... I hate you face.
Ummmmmmmm ….. we’ll see what the follow up trailer does. This didn’t do it for me.
It seems like a musical 😻
Looks like it will be a fun film to watch. Looking forward to it.
This end of year Timothee doble feature.
😴
from muad'dib to Wonka 😶
I wonder if it’s a Origins to the original Willy Wonka.
"Man, Mark Rober is an excellent casting choice for Willy Wonka! He’s an actual engineer too!"
Tom Holland should be perfect for this movie
"the movie might be a little more impressive when it comes out, but just from this trailer Timothy Chalamet's wonka is kinda lacking tbh"
"Everything sucked, except the Oompa-Loompa, and that's not enough for me to go see Willy Woke-ah Oooof!"
LMAO i cant believe this is real. This is either the most self aware movie of all time or the most incognizant movie of all time.
"I can not WAIT! This really looks great, as a big fan on everything Charlie and the Chocolate factory such as films, books and musicals I am expecting this to be great!!"
This look promising.
Already a Timmy Tim stan and this just made me love him more.
❓No way a child finds this storyline interesting
"So I’m gonna have to be the one to say it…n the original movie it’s made clear the candy that makes you float is a prototype and not ready, so how could he have it here before he even starts the factory?"
Two things that stand in this trailer: 1) “Scratch that! Reverse it!” An obvious nod to Gene Wilder (may he rest in peace). 2) The tune that the Oompa Loompa makes with his whistle.
Timothy's dull sounding voice is pretty horrible and a bad fit for the Wonka character. Not a good choice at all!
pls no
"""everything good in this world started with a Dream.....so hold onto yours"" ok I will watch this"
Can't wait!!!! I already love it
I just can’t not see him as lil Timmy t
Nobody Asked for it. But SURE I LOVE IT
Oh no they did it again
I am so damn excited for this movie. Imagine the sequals?!
Didn’t know there was a corporatist and police authoritarianism storyline in Willy Wonka.
Looking forward!!!
"I don't know... this whole ""chocolate factory"" things sounds kind of racists... especially considering that half of the characters are black, and it's set in England."
Mr Bean is in it so I will watch it.  I love all things Rowan Atkinson!
"Meh I'll give it, a try but look like a meh to me."
"Oooo I thought it be a remake... but I was wrong, this looks soo cool!!!"
why does the comment section seem forced?
So is this a prequel to the Gene Wilder movie?
I’m sorry but nobody can replace Johnny Depp.
Wonka lookin breedable
"Let me guess. The black girl is goin to be the key of everything.  

So ""original and refreshing"" 
Another REBOOT that nobody ask."
15 december wonka and 20 december aquaman 2 well done wb you morons
😍
Pass
. . . I’ll stick with Gene . . .
This looks terrible
Yahhh nag this ain't it sorry 👎
Looks really good I can't wait to watch this film 😊
1:41 Mr bean cameo niceee😂
Barbie + Oppenheimer + Napoleon + Wonka = BARHEINAKA
Heck yah !!!
"OMG! What effing trash shift is this garbage???? And whats with the but ugly , no acting skill kid playing Wonka? Dahl is spinning in his grave like a whirling dervish because of this junk."
Well Paddington 2 is one of the best movies ever made. You wouldn’t think so until you see it. So of this has that style then it’ll be a winner.
"Timotheé is daddy.  aye 👁️     👁️ 
                                               👄"
Impatient to discover it !
"Oh my god, its alan johnson"
Damn Timothee's playing 2 iconic literary characters in one year! Versatility right there.
Okay I’m listening…
Is this the origin story of how he became a psychopath
Another woke film
This got me wanting to look forward to other new movies but seems this is the only one worth watching that people are actually taking time and effort to make. 😢
Is this woke? I won't see it unless it woke.
2023 is the year that cinema made its triumphant return!
This looks good. I’m interested.
Not sure about this. Most likely it’s going to be a flop
"Too bad they had to add all those forced woke black characters, its like modern Hollywood is so afraid to put a white couple as protagonists, they always have to pander and make it seem like the world is made of 50% white and 50% black people lmao"
Nah Timothy is not crazy enough to pull off this role. This role was meant for Depp only.
Everything about this one looks perfect and promising Everything but the lead . They should have cast someone more experienced .
Why are so many people complaining about this and saying Timothee is a miscast??? This looks amazing
Will be seeing this film. Looking forward to it.
I was immediately sold when they said it was by the people who made Paddington. This will be a triumph
I'm glad black people are taking roles that were traditionally played by whites. This should stop the riots and murders.
Wonka: the branding of heroine
Timothee ain't it
This Trailer needed more Rowan Atkinson!
"Mr. BEAN, the only one for whom we can watch this movie."
"First reaction Oh no who needed this!
Oh its by the team behind Paddington
And it’s got Timothy chalamet 
And an awesome cast
And Hugh grant is an oompa lompa 
Ok I’m sold!"
Wonder what the black girl feels like knowing she only got the part because of the affirmative action diversity hire Hollywood now has to abide by.
this looks like a crock of shite
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971) is from Paramount Pictures and Wonka (2023) is from Warner Bros. Pictures.
Gene Wilder remains the only and true Willy Wonka
Johnny depp only my willy
I actually am excited about this one!!
Well looks diverse enough
I can't explain it but he looks like someone who dressed up as Willy Wonka for Halloween
I need to watch this 😭😂
Billy Bonka
"No idea how... but the dude is pretty much perfectly capturing Gene Wilder's energy here.
Also, I can't wait for Nestle's Wonka Bars to come back. I've been wanting one for YEARS and there's no way they aren't coming back."
"I saw ""Director of Paddington"" and I was sold"
"Timothée Chalamet😍😍
I am so going to watch this"
I'm going to kms
I love how it retains its original style and humour 😂. This is how I was attracted to the first movie.
"based on these comments, this movie is going to be loved by bots. did we watch the same thing? this is the most flat wonka i've seen. no energy felt like i was watching a high school production with a nervous kid's first role as wonka. wtf. hope the studio loves the yes men they hired to tell them this was a good idea."
"A little spooked that the Wonka theme song (?) uses the same three starting notes as Jurassic Park, at 0:02 and 1:51"
"Love it, he keeps playing Johnny depp roles"
"Omg this looks so garbage, anything with blqck people is actually"
Perhaps this is a prequel to wonka . That’s the only thing I can think of. If it’s a prequel. Then your into somthing Warner
Personally I hope people who don't know of him will fall in love with Neil Hannon's songwriting. Just a magnificent musician.
From the producers of Paddington and the cast of Paddington more like.
"You know that hoverchoc is gonna end bad or they're gonna find someone passing gas and coming back down, since Wonka hadn't even perfect it in the original."
I absolutely love Grant’s Oompa Loopa! Give me more!
Let's hope we get pure imagination this time
"1st - I do have a bit of doubts. TC may have potential but will definitely have to see. No one can replace Gene😢
2nd - is Rowan Atkinson becoming the British version of Nick Cage appearing in almost every movie now
3rd - 😂😂😂 Hugh 😂😂😂Grant 😂😂😂 as an 😂😂😂 Oompa 😂😂😂 lommpa 😂😂😂 I can't ROTF 🤣🤣🤣"
Looks for children
The movie looks great. But  Willy's suspicious and awkward traits are missing. I mean Johnny Depp potreyed the character  best . But still excited about this movies
Another one that didn’t need to happen looks so cheap and rubbish straight to dvd look reminds of that witches they re did or Matilda both absolutely terrible. Il pass
"Wish jim carey was in this movie, would've made it extra memorable with his comedy and energy...a perfect match for this movie"
I’m sure the black girl will be the key to all his success 😂
Absolutely creatively bankrupt.
So it wasn’t a rumor
I didn't know they were making another Snowpiercer prequel.
"WWATCF - 52 years later!
CATCF - 18 years later!"
Very cool . I want to watch this because Rowan is in it
i heard they are gonna race swap slugworth in this
"When the strains of ""Pure Imagination"" began, I went from, ""Oh no, why?"" to ""Oh yes, please!"""
"some of the castings in this a bizarre... what was they thinking and the acting doesnt look all that. it comes across as an SNL skit.
the floating CGI doesn't look believable and he really isn't a good casting for wonka."
Absolutely not. 🤦🏾‍♂️🤦🏾‍♂️
"I love paddington movies, it has Rowan atkinson, I'm already sold"
im here for willy wonka being someone’s wacky adopted dad!!
These days its just remake after remake after remake but hey at least this looks good
Why do they have to change everything?
Looks awesome
Timothee as Wonka is absolutely insane bc he’s absolutely gorgeous and so was Depp and they both played as Wonka😭🖤
"Oh no. This has me worried about Tim C. in the lead role. It's hard not to trust the Paddington director, but this trailer just turned all my hopes into worries :/"
Where is Johnny Depp when you need him
Chalamet just cant be stopped.
"И для чего это сделано? Трейлер так себе, на 4 из 10. Сюжет не интересный. 
Не сравнить с Вонкой и Шоколадной фабрикой. Его история загадочна а единственные его помощники это Лумполумпы. Он отшельник, не любящий детей. 

Зачем портить такого прекрасного персонажа, своими посылами?"
Looks OK nothing special
Johnson's gone far!
Gene Wilder would be super proud!!
"I was so skeptical when J.Depp was taking on the Wonka roll, but surprisingly, their approach wasn’t that cringe. Gene Wilder as Wonka is a HARD role to top. This has me side eyeing the casting director giving such a role to this guy who in my opinion doesn’t have enough range to fill the shoes. I may get ate up for that 😂 but let’s be for real. His supporting casts carry the movies he’s appeared in. Let’s hope they do this some justice!"
So this one is connected to the Gene Wilder one? Cool.
This is actually an all star cast. I even spotted rowan Atkinson
Ugh...
He's clearly been sold as the new Johny Depp
Whatever happened to kids getting punished for their terrible ways? Seems Like Dahl would despise this iteration as well...
Mr Bean
AM SO WATCHING THIS I GREW UP WITH THISSSSSS SERIES OF MOVIES!!! EEEEKKKKKKK am full of magician!
Bet
The first time ever that Atkinson took a check
What's wrong with the first one?
"giving it a chance if the director is behind Paddington, perfect films"
"I'm sorry, it's not the same without Johnny Depp.... Willy Wonka it's his role"
Even Mr Mosebey's ancestor couldn't catch a break
Nope
how about we come up with original ideas instead of taking what's already done
Wtf is this
R.I.P - Gene Wilder.
"Ah, the wholly unnecessary prequel. =9[.]9="
"Looks amazing, I just need to not compare him with Johnny's version and appreciate this as an individual movie , can't wait for it"
"They really running out of movie ideas, huh..."
Timothy chalamet as Willy wonka it’s actually a good casting choice.
Oh my god I can’t wait
Wonka comes off a bit too American
I completely forgot this was being made lol. It reminds me of the movie with Depp in it and I love both the 70s movie and that movie so I'm sure I'll love this too
Bad choice of actor playing wonka....
"Me emociona mucho ver a Timothée como Willy Wonka, estoy muy segura que hará una espectacular actuación, no puedo esperar para verlo 🤩"
Worst movie in alltime
I LOVE THIS
Who up wonking they
I am crying but in happy manner because pure nostalgia has coming my childhood was very imaginable after the Jhonny deep willy wonka movie now again they was coming ❤❤🎉
Cg12a
"I had my doubts, but once I learned Paul King was directing, those doubts melted away."
Looks absolutely terrible 🤣
Mr Bean and Hugh Grant? I’m in
"WB, I promise you can branch out from single word titles for movies. It'll be okay."
So that's what happens when a Hogwarts letter doesn't reach its destination. Wonka making a magic all of his own.
Was another one needed again? Can we have more than remakes/prequels/sequels?
"Hmmm looks intresting excited for sure. Waiting to see the conservatives getting triggered there is a black actor in the film saying ""stop pushing your race agenda"" like black people do not exsit in the real world. IDIOTS!"
I was out until Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. ALL IN.
What the heck atredies became willy wonka?
This is the kind of role that Timothée Chalamet is suited to play. Why they cast him as the lead in Dune is beyond me.
could the giraffe scene be a nod to the Giraffe and the Pelly and Me?
"Paul Atreides' future looks a little goofy here, but nothing for him to have been so horrified about."
I have goosebumps*!
"I can't even imagine what my day dreaming total would be! $3 a day dream, a day, or will I be charged by the minute.🧠😶‍🌫️🤭"
"Not sassy and eccentric enough for Wonka but maybe he'll grow into it, just feels bland."
They destroyed my childhood fr😢
Didn't ask for it but definitely need it!!!!
Was that Mr Bean?
I gonna put this on the must watch list !!!!!!!!!!!
"I feel bad because I know Timothee Chalamet is a good actor...is anyone else not quite feeling his performance based on the sample of it here? He's definitely trying, but Wonka is supposed to be more than just full of wide-eyed childlike wonder. He's got an edge, a dark side. Both previous Wonka movies played up different sides of it, but IDK presenting The Greatest Candyman here may bring down the rest of the film a bit. Also, Hughpa Loompa is a 'no' from me, dawg"
Will never top Johhny Depp ever
Seems like it'll have good special effects but im not seeing Willy Wonkas loony personality in this. Hes supposed to be an eccentric lad but this guy just seems to act like an airhead
"As a person who was raised on a plethora of great movies, including the Charlie and the chocolate factory, I am expecting big things from this."
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and Rowan Atkinson running around screaming?...I'll give it a shot.
"God, this actor sucks who plays Wonka. Terrible in Dune and now this? Hollywood is bankrupt on ideas and talent."
"Never did I expect what is essentially a Willy Wonka panto, but here we are!"
Реально Жопка
"I’m really surprised how unoffended by this I actually am, this really doesn’t seem to tread on any preconceived notions I had about the character"
a movie i never knew i wanted or needed. i’m watching this because it looks like pure fun and imagination come to life.
"Great concept, but the acting looks subpar"
"Wow, how magical, he seems like a natural for this role AND Hugh grant 🔥🔥🔥🔥 that’s an unassuming casting that seems to work!"
This doesn’t look very good
"Ah yes, exactly what the world needed, Willy wonkas backstory starring one of the most wooden actors ever. Just for good measure let’s turn him into the onceler"
The cinematic version of pure imagination is a nice touch
I miss Johny Depp 😢
Goofy ahh Willy wonka
he’s gonna slay so hard i fear
And the funny part I just watched the ad before this and after lol
"OK, sticking Colours where they SHOULD'NT be AGAIN!!!! IT WILL BOMB!!""!"
I need to see this
This is soo good
Rowan should've been cast as Wonka
Bot comments
Nope. This looks awful. Chalamet doesn't sell crazy/endearing well.
"This looks magical, I felt so fuzzy and warm watching it"
"Yet another follow-up remake Hollywood, how shocking...."
It's breaking bad with chocolate for kids
His acting in this looks terrible and a bit cringe lol
No one can match johnny depp
"Bro STG this movie got announced nearly 5 years ago back in early 2019. 
This Writers Strike is just REALLY delaying everything huh?"
"I thought BARBIE was going to be the worst movie of 2023, but now they have some real competition. This looks horrendously bad, not to mention boring af. Violet and Veruca and Augustus are rolling over in their graves."
We now have a full Wonkaverse. 1. Wonka 2. Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 3. Snowpiercer
Johnny Depps Son playing him 17 years later 😳
"As a big Willy Wonka fan, I hope this doesn't fall flat."
This is great can’t wait to watch and how lucking i found it when I was posted 3 hours later lol
I feel like it’s a prequel to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory movie but it gives Greatest Showman vibes and it has Timotee frikin Chalamet in it 💘
Good trailer man. Had zero interest in seeing this from the press releases etc but I may actually give it a watch. Trailer guys did their job.
1:02 The Legend 🥺❤
"Damn, I’m just not feeling chalamet as wonka 😔"
Mr bean???
I have relatively little faith in movies but the casting in this is perfect. Looks great.
"Sir, you said “I’ve spent the past 7 years traveling the world perfecting my craft”….. so you started when you were 9???"
doesn't look good to me
Absolutely love it
This movie is fantastic and magical too!
This movie is gonna fail as hard as Dial of Destiny.
"Everything but 2 things makes me really like what I see about this movie so far. One of the two is the Oompa Loompa. It just makes me go ""Why?"". The other is a major one considering the character is who the movie is about is Timothy's Wonka. I really think he doesn't fit as Wonka at all, or at least from this trailer."
This just looks like an amazing time! Looking forward to it!
Жопка
"This is definitely better then Depp Wonka, May give this one a go."
that’s how it’s done Disney!
"Damn I was really hoping this was gonna be a dark movie not a silly sing along. Show us how Wonka gets the workers, pulled up to an island and just took some people that don’t look like him and made them work."
Lame.
Wonka is Awesome 👍
sí
NOONE NEEDS ANOTHER GOD DAMNED WILLY WONKA MOVIE WTF!
"If this is as nice as the trailer, I'm taking all the grandkids to see it."
This kind of character only suitable for Johnny depp...❣️
No one asked for this
Вилли Жопка и шоколадная фабрика
Beutifull ❤
my jaw dropped when i saw timothee chalamet playing as wonko
Hmmmm Naaahhhh!!!
This looks good
So is this gonna be a reboot or the story set years before the golden ticket stuff
it's wonky time!
i'm here for sally hawkins
This looks like dumb fun. Definitely on my watch list
From a movie teaching kids to behave to a movie goofy and fun.
Why? Just why?
I saw Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant….that’s enough for me to see this
Rowan Atkinson's in this movie?!
Timothee chalarmet ❤
I feel like bots are trying to promote this 😂😂😂 sorry you won’t beat the old the original
"I can’t wait for this to come out, and I’m so glad they followed the original movie theme 🤩"
Anyone notice timothee’s acting is quite off?
who up wonkin they willy right now
This guy who plays wonka is trash. Being held up by the cast around him. Gene Wilder would be turning in his grave
Serious question. Many of the comments posted for this trailer today are duplicate copy/pasted comments from different accounts. The comment “the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has” was been posted by at least 6 different users within the first 30 minutes of the trailer being posted. Are these WB accounts? AI? Paid endorsers? Some of these accounts are many years old so not new fake accounts.
I was a bit unsure about this but now I can't wait
Wowww! Oompaa Loompa are here again 😮😮
Timothy doesn’t have the crazy look that really gives Wonka his edge as a character.  Maybe he wants to still “look cool” even in what should be a silly and lighthearted role such as this one.
People are gonna write this off only because it's not the original
"Gives the same vibes as The return of Mary Poppins
Love it!"
Movie titles try not to just use the last name challenge (DIFFICULTY IMPOSSIBLE)
I never knew that i needed to se something where i was a bit creeped out and entertained at the same time....
No no no please no why remakes again and again no no no
"I'm not feeling this Willy and I not this title either. The title should be ""Willy Wonka"" not ""Wonka"". I mean nobody calls The Rock, Rock.
But other than that most everything else looks great."
MR BEAN 😍😍😍😍😍😍😍
MY ONE TRUE LOVE TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
"If Keegan-Michael Key is gonna be in it, then it’s gonna be good 😂❤"
"hmmmmm no 
came here bc of curiosity but no don't like Timothee 
i'm gonna stay with Johnny version ( not the same ik)"
The title of this movie is way too close to wanka
"So... Timothee Chalamet is going to reprise his Paul Atreides role in ""Dune Part 2"" in November, and then a month later, we will see him as Willy Wonka in this movie.  Looks like this holiday season is Chalamet all the way."
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is something I didn’t know I needed in my life
Why do they have to keep remaking this movie? The original won't be replaced. Who is watching these???
This looks extremely dumb. Warner Bros... just gives us a sequel to the Iron Giant already.
ЖОПКА
"Not sure if Wonka the chocolate factory movie or 'Wonka' the shrooms chocolate bar, factory, movie."
the tribute to his mom part is all I needed to melt🫶🏿
"There should NOT be Americans in this movie, just Brits. And before someone brings up Johnny depp, yes I know. Lol"
Olivia Colman 🙏🏼🙏🏼
"Wow.  A black female costar, a black mayor and the ONLY mention of the word ""woke"" is the one I just made.  I think this marks the first time I'm proud of a YouTube comments page."
"I honestly have no idea what I would make of this trailer were I not aware of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory context. It certainly looks like a fun, whimsical, well-designed children's film with a great sense of world-building and fantasy. But I have no idea what I'd make of the premise, and whether I'd think it felt contrived or forced. Oh well. I'll definitely check it out, anyway."
I’m so excited!
"Well doesn't this scream agenda, wokeness, diversity and inclusion, and my god, not only gender swap, but race swapping Charlie as well.  This is a desecration of everything that  Roald Dahl created, and you just took a 💩💩💩💩 all over it."
I am actually excited to watch this
What a joke of a film😂
Why remake a classic? Because they needed to go woke?
"Thank you for not making Willy a ""girl"". I hope ""he"" remains a ""man"". Sigh! Times..."
"Oh great, another fairytale. You know, actually having a dream is not at all what is presented in movies. Because fantasy is everything around us."
Woke 🤣
Has some Pan (2015) vibes…
"The original Wonka is legit a masterpiece.  Untouchable.  And here we are now...years later...with a SECOND reboot.   sigh.

That being said, i wish this film and its fans no ill will.   I do hope it finds new ground with the subject and opens a whole new generation to the world o wonka.   #snozzberries"
Hollywood has truly lost original ideas. Thank goodness for Christopher Nolan. Like for Oppenheimer
i’ve always wanted a prequel for wonka and this is looking like it can live up to it.  so excited
"Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa/s
And Rotwan Atkinson in one movie. Take my money, I'm all in"
Was shocked that Wesley Snipes wasn’t cast as Wonka.
Depp would have been better ❤
TRASH!!!!
"This is not how I imagined Willy Wonka becoming a thing, just trying to outsmart a chocolate cartel by bypassing some ""need a shop to sell chocolate"" law by making an oompa loompa free labor shop somewhere else."
Oh this looks so cute
I have never like this kid sorry
"Remember seeing the original as a little kid when it first came out in theaters. Seen it countless times since.  I begrudgingly ended up enjoying Tim Burton's version, particularly Danny Elfman's music.  This one also looks promising.  Should do well, I think."
this blew me out of the water. im stoked
This looks so amazing and so many british actors! This is gonna be good!
"LMAOOO a CGI Oompa Loompa??! Looks alright, no one can top Gene Wilder's performance tho"
Was this really necessary????
So is this Charlie from the original movie
Rubbish actor
Must watch
Bring back Henry Cavill
Apologize to the Johnny Depp film now...
This looks--much better than I was expecting.
This has a completely different vibe than the other movies
Huhh
Solo espero que la peli se sienta igual de magica y creatuva que el trailer si no es así me tiro d eun barranco
He seems to be embodying Gene Wilder's version of Willy Wonka and I'm all for that!
Bring back Henry Cavill
1:02 and 1:41  is that Rowan Atkinson?! Honestly would watch just for him lol
Bro forgot to age
"Oppenheimer, Napoleon, now Wonka. If there's any proof that cinema has one more chance at survival, it's this."
"I wanna wanna say enough with the origin stories no-one asked for, but this looks kind of fun in all the right ways."
Didn’t they already remake this movie?
"Wow, this looks… really bad."
Praise the LORD for creating cocoa trees!
"Babe wake up, a new tumblr sexyman just dropped"
I love the little nods to the original movie in the music. Pure Imagination!
I did not expect Hugh Grant.
Bring back Henry Cavill
"Ugh. Another movie that didn't need to be made. Folks, the reason that the original is so loved is because of one thing: Gene Wilder. But he's gone and nothing you do will match the success of the original. So, speaking of original, try to be more of it."
This looks very promising. Very excited to see it when it comes out
This looks so bland and insipid
Beat a dead horse
Johnson?
Жопка😁
that kid can't act;  and he surely cannot act goofy and eccentric   he's outta his league here.
After seeing Rowan Atkinson this movie is on my watch list
How on Earth did someone get Hugh Grant to agree to being a Oompa-Loompa?
The chocolate must flow
Inclusion ruin everything
"WOW the writers strike, strikes again."
Well Sally Halkings and Hugh Grant ... that's what I call Paddington vibes :D  sadly no Paddington 3 yet :(
Bring back Henry Cavill
"nope nope nope and NOPE who asked for this, there is only one Wonka and that is Gene Wilder"
Boring
"I'm not sure quite how I feel about this, but Rowan Atkinson shouting Monty Python's ""Run away!"" line and all the nods to the Gene Wilder version rose an eyebrow or two. Hollywood has been such a dismal failure this year; it would be nice to have at least one decent film in the lot."
This looks so fun I can't wait
It’s Johnson from the Peep Show!
chalamet has maybe 3 facial expressions.
We need Johnny Depp
This honestly looks charming
i have nothing against Timothee but i feel like this is a miscast
It's not a Disney movie...i see
Timothee fans >>>
Oh dear.
it's been long since we saw willy wonka. Welcome back!
Every one is saying this looks amazing and I feel the opposite. I’m actually hoping that I’m the one who is wrong.
"Hm...I don`t know. On one hand I`m SO glad we`re not rehashing the same old scenes and parts like before,but on the other...

For me,the best aspect of Wonka WAS his mystique and not knowing whether what we were told was real or not. It might just be me,but I never particularly bothered to find out how his factory came to be,where he found the Oompa Loompas etc. It`s a big part of why the 70s movie worked so well for me(to Dahl`s chagrin). Wonka in my opinion,seemed SO much more than human. It hasn`t escaped my attention the irony of `CHARLIE and the Chocolate Factory` being the name of the original work(centering on a child`s growth,development and facing reality) now serves as inspo only for `Wonka`. Just like how Oompa Loompas served Willy himself 😂 😂"
I can’t put my finger on it but this doesn’t look good. Just doesn’t feel like Willy Wonka to me
Do not make old movies 21st century good🎉
The movie no one asked for.
It's giving me Fantastic Beasts/Cats/Big Fish but not in a good way.
"that was a good movie, glad i watched the whole thing now"
Laquisha and The Chocolate Factory feat. WokeKa..... No thanks.....
They really do be running out of movie ideas don't they 🧐
im on the fence timothy wasnt brining the energy
It feels like he lacks Willy's weirdness. He looks too ambitious and focused.
This is giving a 90s vibe i like it you got my money ;)
This movie seems so good I am really looking forward to watch it especially with timothèe as willy wonka I am not gonna miss that 😍
"What next? ""Humpty""?!?"
"Willy Wonka is actually selling his weird stuff and not just his chocolate bars. Respect to WB for going in a new direction rather than just the ""I need a replacement for my chocolate factory"" also I enjoyed the Harry Potter vibe from the setting, Wonka may not have been magical but his candy sure seems to be."
FINALLYYYY 😭😭😭 I'M EXCITED FOR THUS MOVIE 🥺🥺
"Every good thing in this world is started with a dream, dam."
Timmy can't act
Just 3768 hours to wait. Well... kinda.
"This reminds me of a different movie but idk what it is, but atst i kinda wish it felt more like the past wonka movies"
Oh nooooo... not Chalamet!
Bruh
Incoming flop
MR. BEANNNNN!!!
Another WB movie flop 🙄
"Ok, so this isn't some dark reboot, it's a straight up prequel.  That is a bold choice.  Kid's gonna have to really get angry-crazy to match Wilder's quiet intensity as Wonka though."
Why?
Who the f greenlights this garbage
"There is only one Willie Wonka movie, this isn't it."
wow that cast
🍭 oh wow... this actually looks kinda cute
Timothee AND Mat Baynton?? We're so in for a treat
i wanted wonka to be murderer and go on a killing spree but i guess this will be fine
This is by far the most exciting movie other than the Barbie movie I’m excited to see..
Thought this was going to be a reboot but its an origin story which im all up for. Hopefully they can add a cameo of Johnny Depp.
Ooompa loompa HUGH GRANT HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
"omg!!! i got goosebumps !! im so excited for this movie!! can't wait! :)
perfect for Christmas!!"
"Well this looks terrible, congrats"
"Made by the producers of Harry Potter, any movie with elements of that kind of magic is right up my alley. Now I wouldn’t mind a prequel to Mary Poppins, to know where she comes from and how she got her magic."
"Еееебааать, Тимоха, вот это ахуенно 
Я заметила,что От каждого фильма про Вилли Вонку исходит разный вайб"
I see Jeremy Clarkson can finally fit in a Mini Cooper classic.
Besides Mr Bean… movie seems to be trash.. DOA
ЖОПКА
Why?
"in rus, the ""WONKA"" logo looks like ""ЖОПКА,"" which in eng is ""butt"". how not to laugh now?"
It's like a fairytale but with a magician
What is this trailer's music very similar to the one piece live action trailer's music? xD
Oh No! I'm not going to be the spoiler and tell you this film is going to end TRAGICALLY with that little girl. 🥺💔😔 Something will happen to her in the end. She will get Cancer or I dunno get food poisoned.
Amazing man woolie wonka was such amaazing ❤
actor not good enough to play wonka
"If I see Mr Bean, I m watching it😂🎉"
"“I’m something of a candy maker myself”

- Harry Osborne"
Wow
Oh no they snapped we makin it out the chocolate factory with this one 🔥
"1.3M in just 2hrs! Damn, y'all really excited huh?"
It was a drink not chocolate that made Charlie and his Grandad fly in the book and the original film
Is that the 2nd part of CHARLIE & THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY 👀
"Appalled at the fact that studios would make remakes of classics just for the sake of diversity. 
Coming up with new ideas? No. Just make remakes and change genders and colours."
"they have the og music in the mix

this is gene wilders wonka holy"
This looks pretty good.  I'm pleasantly surprised that it doesn't look like a victim of Hollywood wokeness disease.
They had me on the director of Paddington
Paul.....put the spice down. You've had enough.
only chocolate no chocolate color girl
Terrible portrayal of Willy wonka just insulting to the character. They messed up not casting Jeremy Allen White
"Timothee as Willy Wonka when he was younger has to be such a perfect choice. I grew up with Johnny Depp's, and my mom grew up with Gene Wilder's. I hope this generation will have the same love for Willy Wonka as I did when I was a kid. ❤"
Not another remake…
This is really bad
"God, why? He has 0 charisma, ew. His acting feels extremely forced."
"W.W. Woodrow Wilson? Willy Wonka? 
-Minerals"
"After seeing this trailer I can now surely believe how much of a perfect and intriguing depp's willy wonka was, Every detail of his wonka's character was captivating, memorable and unique. Timothee's wonka is so simple only the clothing have been done good but otherwise overall timothee's character development is not looking that cool or majestic, They didn't even added or subtracted in his facial features by adding new colour tones to face which could have made him look different in character. whereas,
However, Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka had every sort of subtle, unique and eccentric layers to his wonka, even the face tone in on his wonk'a face was so fascinating that even till to this day I can't imagine anyone else playing wonka. I'm a bit skeptical about this film's creation of wonka, Timothee is not even giving half of the expression Depp gave in his version of the movie, I feel that this film is not that much captivating but if it manages to work on box office than it would be due to only one reason and that is because of beautiful cinematography"
This film is make a very best special magical musical tastiest delicious sweet as a candy and Chocolate could ever eat! Because the whole Wonka Candy and Chocolate will make us hunger and tasted sweet candy and chocolate for all of us in the whole world
Mr Bean in the house
"I don't feel that Timothée Chalamet was the right actor for this character, he can't conjure up that specific kind of energy and charisma that is Willy Wonka and characters of that sort. It's not that TC is a bad actor, he's just not right for this particular role. Everything else looks great though. It's sad when they put actors in roles just because they are ""trending"" at the moment, instead of finding the right actor for the character."
Im just here for Rowan Atkinson
Looks woke.
"Magical, colorful and full of imagination, qualities lacking in the Tim Burtons version …..can’t wait!!!"
The last Willy Wonka film I seen was with Johnny Deep or maybe this movie is a prequel to the original Willy Wonka movie?!!!
Now this I am looking forward to!
HUGH GRANTALOOMPA!
Kya Woke Bakwaas hai😢
Anyone getting Oz the great and powerful vibes or is it just me
"Good chocolate. Needs more spice, though."
MR CARSON!!! :) this looks delightful
"oo, seems interesting, I am going to see it"
"This guy can't compete with Depp's Wonka in the slightest. Does Hollywood not have more young actors but this guy and Tom Holland? Like, come on. This is pathetic."
Why?
"I had no interest in this (as much as I love Timothee Chalomet), but when I saw it's the same director as Paddington, I suddenly became very, very intrigued."
Saw Mr.Bean..GUYS HES ALIVEEE
"Me before watching trailer: 😒
Me after watching trailer: 😁"
I couldn’t be more excited! This looks excellent!
"After SUDDEN destruction, I doubt there will be a movie house standing by Christmas that will actually be used to show this, or any other movie. BE YE WARNED. REPENT NOW. 
SEEK JESUS NOW, WHILE HE MAY STILL BE FOUND. 
🎺🌾👰🪔✨"
Who asked for this??
I can't wait to watch this on HBOmax
Trash😂
Is this a prequel to the original movie or the Johnny Depp version?
Am I the only person who wants Jonny Depp as Wonka?
I have a good feeling about this one
1:03 mr BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAN
"i can firmly add this movie to my ""must watch for Christmas"" movie list XD"
I would love a post credit scene where we see Grandpa Joe getting a job with Wonka
This makes me so excited and emotional because I love MR. Wonka 🥹🥹🥰🥰🥰😘😍Timothy is going to be excellent 😊
I wish Johnny Depp would have a cameo on this
"Me:- randomly flips to that ""it has to be a kid"" scene from family guy😂😂😂"
🤔 yeah I think I might just have to watch it
"Русские люди успешно запомнят этот фильм как ""жопка"""
Mid. Calling it now
There's ROWAN ATKINSON!!! And yes I'm screaming!!
There’s no way I won’t not watch this
DOWNFALL☠️
I'm surprised wonka himself isn't played by a black actor.
Suprised they didn't race swap willy wonka.
Oh my gosh it looks wonderful
Жопка
So these are the roles you get when you're jewish and bang Armie Hammer as a teenager...
Жопка
the way watching this trailer instantly lifted my mooooood
Hope to see Wonka's dentist father in this too 😂😂😂💥💥💥✨✨✨
just seeing Rowan Atkinson even when doing nothing makes me laugh already
"A goofy white guy who gets all his ideas from a woman of color in the background.......multicultural cast........all the bad guys are white guys.  I can see where this is going.  Sorry WB, but I will gladly bend over and YOU can smell MY chocolate factory !!!!"
Looks cool but please stop showing so much of you're movie in the trailer. It's so irritating
Wonkaaaaaaaa!!!
they made willy a whimsical twink 💀
Flop
Time do uncover the past of how Willy Wonka got rich under the exploitation of cheap Oompa Loompa labor! HYPE!
the prequel of the 70s version. they really did their homework
I miss Jhonny Depp as Willy Wonka ❤️
"Yay! Statistically perfect multicultural casting!!!!!
AND Chalamet proving to be less and less dynamic as time goes on!!!
Woooooo!"
Kylie Jenner 😍
"Unfortunately it seems like they’re trying to emulate the original movie. This is a problem because it’s impossible to emulate. The Gene Wilder Wonka is such a unique performance, with so much of Wilder in it, that the “Wilder-esque” moments in the trailer, as talented as Chalamet is, seems like he’s trying to do an impression rather than play a character. They should’ve gone back to the source and re-adapted."
That random little black girl went on to be his COO LOL. 😂
"Not sure how I feel about them morphing a trickster figure into a heroic underdog. The inclusion of a child as a sidekick seems to pull away from the crux of his character arc in the original: Wonka is a lone genius who only comes to appreciate and allow space for a protegee at the end of his career, after putting both himself and the possible replacments through a tricky lil crucible.

This all feels very very kiddified for a story that was already approachable for kids!"
"Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is not some thing I had on my 2023 Bingo card. But I’ll take it. 

I’ll see it for him and Rowan Atkinson"
Imagine getting fined for daydreaming 😂
"Too late I’ve started dancing now 

Once we’ve started we cannot stop 😂😂😂"
Paul took too much spice and this is what he saw in his head.
Who up wonking their willy rn
"There are no such laws that prohibit daydreaming irl, that’s got to be the most unrealistic law I’ve ever heard of in my in entire life, I mean… opening up a basic Chocolate Stand, Cookie Stand, or Lemonade Stand without permits are one thing, but a fictional law in the Wonkaverse where Daydreaming is prohibited? That’s gotta be the most unrealistic law to ever be made up… isn’t it 0:39? I mean what real life country in their common sensible mind would be this bonkers to make up such an absurdist law that nonsensically prohibits one’s personal moment to daydream whatever he, she, or they are thinking about anyway?

I honestly can’t wait to see this Wonka Origin film when it comes out of course, although I still don’t get who in their right mind would want to lawfully prohibit daydreaming by outlawing it, mean… isn’t usually common sense for a boss to tell their own employed workers in workplaces to stop daydreaming and get back to work or else they’ll get fired? Sure daydreaming could get anyone in trouble if they happen to be working in a work environment, and that they could only daydream when given or taking a break from work, but what Popcorn brained whack job in their political mindset prohibits those taken breaks from their jobs, unemployed, or those who’d happen to be homeless folk in the wonkaverse from daydreaming in general 0:39?

I mean there’s no such laws in real life countries that would prohibit the unemployed or homeless from daydreaming in general… right?… this Prohibitive idea of outlawing daydreaming is even more absurdly outrageous than the fictional prohibitive laws in the Dystopian Post Apocalyptic PSVITA Title: Freedom Planet, where a human being’s unauthorized existence, amnesia be it intentional or unintentional, or starting a family etc are all ridiculously considered huge crimes by the Freedom Wars world’s standards I tell ya' wonka fans what."
"Oh great, more Timothee Chalamet.  😒"
I have never thought and I never wanted them to make another Charlie and Chocolate Factory movie because the first one was perfect. Now I have to see a remake I'm not watching that.
I like that it’s not cringe.
All I needed were OGstyle oompa loompa songs. Make Hugh Grant the Oompa Loompa and now I'm fired up.
No
So chocolate is basically crack in this universe? Explains why he made it with a chemistry set.
WAS THAT MATHEW BAYNTON
"Ok, I VERY much appreciate that this isn't too gritty!"
If you love chocolate.. you’ll love this movie!
"Oh my god, yes please"
Is that f'ing Johnson?
Meh.. I don't think this world needed a reboot. I'll wait for reviews since nothing in it made me want to go back and read the books or watch the previous movies.
While this looks charming I can't help but feel that Timothee is a bit miscast in this. It almost seems like he is doing an impression of the Wonka actors before him rather than embodying the character and making it his own but we'll see.
"He's wonky, maybe even a lil willy I betcha."
It doesnt look as good as the last one with JD but we will see
Please be good. Jonny made this a memory for me
December? Wtf! 😩
Definitely taking my daughter to see this.
"Willy Wonka, walking down the streets.... 🎵"
is this gonna be a musical or not. i wanna know
se ve muy britanico para willy wonka
Looks like woke garbage. Pass.
This looks cute
I would definitely take my kid to see this. If he was still a kid.
"So this is all about the young wonka? Remind me of the old willy wonka in charlie & the chocolate factory, can they meet just like in multi universe?"
I think they've finally got it right.
"Опять слишком много негров‼️ 🤮
Даже полисмена сделали негром 😂😂😂"
"I don't care for Timothy Chalemet, just something about him I don't trust..."
"Great cast. Timothee Chalamet, great actor...buuuuut, not whom I would've chosen to play Willy Wonka. I'm guessing this is based off the Gene Wilder Wonka and not Johnny Depp. Either way, I'm not seeing Chalamet channel either. We'll see."
Timothy as Willy Wonka is something I never imagined I'd see😭
Hollywood hates Johnny so much they are trying to cover up one of his best movies
"""Жопка"" 🌚"
"So again, no little people are cast?"
I feel like he is too young
"""From the Director of Paddington"" I'm sold, those movies are cinematic masterpieces"
Why is he whispering so much?
Woka 😝
I hate how they keep making Willy wonka movies
"Zero whimsy. Hes a great actor but you need a larger than life character to play this role. Like a Jim Carrey or a like Jack Black even. Wilder set a high bar because he was so unpredictable, and charming yet intense. This just feels sterile and i feel like ive already seen it. He struggles to get seen, then wins people over runs the “chocolate cartel” out of town and then at the end he gets a building and starts talking about making the factory, then depending on the success of the movie there will be another one of him building the factory. Feels like another Cruella. Its a shame this would have been cool. Ill still watch it and hope I’m wrong. 🤞🏻"
oh what a surprise they blocked word e-n-g-l-i-s-h from their comments.
Жопка
Timothee Chalamet as Wonka looks great. Definitely gonna be checking this out.
"ah forced diversity in 1920's England, that'll be a pass, get woke go broke"
NO
"Ugh, not another one."
Wow lol
"Жопка, значит"
"Oh, look a movie nobody asked for being made for the third time in 2 decades. I don't care what anyone says, Hollywood is not out of ideas, they just have the same 10 ideas over and over again. I predict it loses 50 million."
"He doesn't have the charisma, he is so terribly flat"
I mean...they were dwarves...why didn't they cast dwarves now as well?
More little people out of work due to CGI
Difference of opinion but no... this looks bad.
No imagination? Just remakes?
I don’t know about mr McStiff but maybe he could use it as a weird humour
Rowan Atkinson ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
I was with this and then the Oompa Loompa at the end scared me.
"Hmmmm... Looks good. I know Timothy did theater, so he might be good in this role. Never really seen him in anything else but dramas, so I'm interested to see how well he will do this genre."
i like how they are leaning in to the goofy and the absurdity of willy wonka trying to do this with seriousness would not work as well
No thanks
Looks great 👍
No thank you!
This looks Scrumdiddlyumptious.
"Justa simple, charismatic movie we all needed. Rowan Atkinson put a smile on my face."
You seem to have forgotten that both charlie and wonka were ENGLISH.  Stop being culture vultures.
i feel this is gonna be good...!
Why can’t they make anything original anymore?
"Everything in this movie looks great, but why Charmaine? He is not the best actor"
"looks decent, hopefully it steers clear of modern woke politics"
"I’m really interested. 
Looks like a faithful prequel from the original made with care."
I think they need to leave this film alone   We’ve seen enough of these renditions.  What is this. Like the 3rd Willy wonka? 🤦🏽‍♂️ Hollywood isn’t creative anymore. Half of every movie coming out now is remakes
So many of the lines he says are so underdelievered.. they needed someone who has more depth and knows how to handle lines lke genewilder could handle.
This looks every bit as whimsical and magical as the original film. I'm for it.
OMG ❤
"Dune in November, Wonka in December, I know the actor of the year 2023 now."
Why?
This looks like the very worst thing ever
This movie looks good and a good prequel to the original
"I cannot wait to see how many children Willy Wonka is bringing down to his basement this time.💀
Also, it would be foolish of me to think that Wonka is only exploiting one Oompa Loopa.👴"
This is sooo cheesy
"If i had a nickel for every time they adapted Charlie and The Chocolate Factory into a film I'd have 3 nickels, which isn't a lot but it's weird that it happened thrice."
Hopefully it doesn't flop
Omg!!!! Perfect cast. I've been waiting for thissss
No trailer has ever put me off a film so quickly
🥰🥰🥰✨♥️✨
As a pessimist I am actually thinking this is gonna be a fun movie
"so excited for this,more than any superhero movie"
1:34 Help isn't he the guy from Horrible Histories 😭😭
This feels more like harry potter than Fantastic Beast....damn😂
"Damn, Hollywood really is out of ideas. 😂 Can’t wait to see this movie flop just like every movie that’s came out this year."
"Timothee as Willy Wonka is fcking whack 😂. 
I’ll definitely be watching this. Looks lit."
Kwisatz Haderach in alternative timeline
Willy Wonka 🎩🍫
ЖОПКА 🤣
"I am questioning the casting choice of High Grant, though. It is so...odd."
I am really sad that it’s not Johnny Depp you is gonna play Wonka 🥺💔
"More like ""Wanka"""
Childhood memories coming back!🥲❤️
"I didn't think Chalmét would be right for this, but he seems to capture the same eccintricity that Johnny Depp had"
This looks like garbage
Жопка)
Could never imagine in dreams Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas but man this is so loveable!
👎🏻
Zhopka
"oml cannot wait for this movie!!! Burst out laughing at Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson!! 😂😂😭😭 so happy to see Sally Hawkins here too, feels like a small homage to Paddington!! 🥹🫶🏻"
Please dont make Willie Wonka woke🤦
"It gives "" Greatest Showman"" vibes"
"Great....break the mistery, exploit a story. Bunch of lazy studios...just creat smth new already. Stop the cameos. CASH GRAB MONEY BAIT."
Black people didn't even exit in the time of the willy wonka story. They always need to insert themselves in to anything
"This looks like it would look amazing in 3D, hope we get it in 3D."
This is gonna be my Joker
It looks like Timothy Chalamet channelling @danielthrasher
"Wait okay so by the look of the Oompa Loompa at the end, is this actually a prequel to the original Willy Wonka movie??? If it is… that’s awesome!"
this is so cringe
They completely reeled me in acknowledging nobody wants to hear the Oompa Loopa song hahahahaha
"I have never seen any of the Willy Wonka movies and I’m 19. I will definitely check this out, and might watch the original films first. This looks like it’ll be a happy and fun musical film."
Looks amazing
"Timothée Chalamet had my curiosity with Dune, now he has my attention with this"
Again?
"Oh no. Another milking of an old franchise that’s nostalgic in a painfully obvious attempt to make easy money. Can’t wait to see how this flops at the box off-

“From the Director of Paddington”

……I’ll let you cook a little longer……"
omggggg it finally happening im soooooooooooooo excited 😆
"I'm not sure what it is, but Timothee Chalamet just isn't doing it for me as Wonka. Also why is there a child with him who is never so much as mentioned in the book or either of the movies?"
Mr. Carson!
"When he said ""I am wonking my willie"" literal chills 🥵"
Wonka is only one..... Johnny Depp !!!!
😍👍✌
He's gonna be a great Willie Wanka
Rowan Atkinson??? And Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa omg 🤩
What happened to Willy?
"I rarely dislike a movie from the trailer, but this looks ""not so good""."
LET’S GOOOOOO
"Oompa loompa dupidy dawesome

Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome 

Why was he gone he was such a nice guy

No he was not he was a total doushe

Dupidy dup"
1:40 rowin atkinson hello?
"Come on....stop it already. Give is new charachters, new stories, instead of cameos rip offs. Thimothy will be crushed here....Dep's version was horrendous already with nth but wide eyes and wierd empty faces ...this clip shows Timothy doing the same. Will there be also some of ""the message"" as certain drinker would say?? 😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴😴"
"I GENERALLY CANT WAIT FOR THIS! HYPED ASF! The production and prop design look beautiful. Love the Roald Daul’s works, great cast and so excited to see it was by the same director who did Paddington. 

This film will be magical!"
This looks terrible.
Damn Chalamet looks like a mix of Wilder and Depp’s version of the character
This made my heart feel warm. ☺
Жопка
Oh look another remake 🤦‍♂️
This movie better be good
I can't wait to watch this on TNT in 10 years when there's nothing else on.
why so many dislikes?
"I’m so glad this is not a remake, rather the story of how Wonka became Wonka"
He’s the calmest Willy wonks I’ve ever seen
Come on... spend money on smth better... we already got perfect Wonka... Johny will never be changed by this little shalaman kid whatever
This looks like a documentary Willy Wonka would make. This actually looks good
So its mother issues again
Can’t Hollywood make original movies anymore
"I saw a glimpse, a smudge, a crumb of Rowan Atkins...so I will wait with baited trepidation and mute expectation that there is nothing woke, and therefore broke, in this movie. 😬 
There's still time. 
There's still hope."
Bro he seems nothing compared to the og wonka 😭
gene wilder nailed it so stop trying.
Just another shameless cash grab to milk out as much nostalgia as possible
I hope Johnny Depp make a cameo
"Look everyone, the included ""Diversity"". See? No one cares."
I don't care.
Well I’m gonna cry while watching this. 🥲 LONG LIVE GENE WILDER🕊 the man who brought the character of Willy wonks to life
"Of course his sidekick is a black girl. No story can exist unless we wedge in an important character of color. Something tells me her character is the genius that he couldn’t do it without, and she has the idea or plan that saves the day."
Looks really diverse.
always the blackwash :))
This looks like a great Christmas movie
"If Johnny Depp couldn't pull off a better performance that Gene Wilder, then Timmy Chardonney doesn't stand a chance!"
I wonder if this will get dark somehow
"I hope they base him on the older movie wonka, and not on micheal jackson again"
"não vou mentir, parece ser bom,  talvez não seja uma bilheteria astronômica, mas parece que vai ser bem legal pra levar os filhos pra Assistir"
Not impressed
За целый трейлер ни одной ЖОПКИ. how disappointing...
"NBD, just him selling chocolate at the Galería Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan, small beginnings I guess..."
December !!!!
He doesn't have Johnny Depps Michael Jackson swag but i'm interested in seeing Tims portrayal nonetheless
Ok. You have my full attention.
"Winter movie, this looks promising already, will be a good watch during winter :D"
Gorgeous and delectably charming.
Already better than Johnny depp version.
"*The Chocolate Cartel?*

Damn we about to get people getting drowned in the Hot Chocolate Swamps💀💀💀"
Suddenly every other rando is a CGI expert and an academy award winner 😂😂😂 stop complaining seesh
"Me see Rowan Atkinson, me love it."
This looks bad
HAHA  Another remake?  HOW STUPID!!!!!!   LOL
Жопка))))
"willy wonka with a chocolate companion, that is so funny."
Of course they had to go woke and add blacks to the remake
Bad casting
Ehh
Of course the co-star is black lol Hollywood can't help themselves with their fake virtue signaling. I'll stick with the original 1971 version thank you...
❌#NotMyWonka
The Greatest Showman + Mary Poppins + Fantastic Beasts + Miss peregrine's home for peculiar children + Dolittle = This movie.
"It’s not giving ✋🏾

Edit: it actually is omg I will be seated"
I was wishy-washy right up until Hugh Grant as an Oompa-Loompa and now I am so in!
who up wonkin they willy rn?
"This gonna be one the movies of all time, for sure"
"Can't wait to see it. I was a kid when Gene Wilder's movie came out, a grown man, proud and happy father when Johnny Depp""s version came out, now I'll be taking my by December 7 year old grandaughter to see this new installment, a family classic, a story to wonderful not to enjoy it.😉"
This dropping during the holiday season is a brilliant choice - can't wait to see the production and the world they've created.
I’m excited I loved Willy wonka and the chocolate factory as a kid
WHy?
"Oof, this looks awful. The humor isn't right for Willy Wonka. Too cynical and self-aware. The whimsy also feels cheap. I'm really hoping this is a case of a trailer making a movie look much worse than it is because I would love to love this movie."
"I can’t wait for twink wonka, or Twonka™️ as I like to call him"
This looks really bad
Johnny Depp will always be the Willy Wonka in my head though
I am starting to love everything this Chalamet kid is in.
Well atleast he’s still white..
Nope
I've never wanted to be an ommpa loompa so badly
that black girl does not look like a oompa loompa
i see the guy from horrible histories and I'm sold
Atleast Grandpa Joe wont be there
"Sad I am allergic to chocolate, so I am not qualified to watch this amazing movie"
Johnny Depp version still king
I cant wait!!!
This is a MUST
I am so proud of lil timmy tim. He is such a nice guy and actor. Really enjoying all of his work.
I think they have started making movies again... ;-)
"this is SO the opposite of Dahl... as a longtime fan, I am besides myself. a new generation will believe this corny little movie is what Dahl is all about... I am a fan of cute, tender movies like Paddington or HP but Dahl is NOT this."
no.
"This looks incredibly lame, but of course everyone will watch this unoriginal uninspired movie based on preexisting IP and tell publishers that this is exactly what we want"
Johnny depp 😢
This dude as Wonka is a big no !!!!! Like he can't bring the crazy like jhonny Depp.
Can't wait for Limmy to review this trailer
It would be nice if the original Charlie was the New Grandpa Joe 😃💯💯
I think Hollywood are just incapable of writing there own stories…. Everything is just an adaptation. This looks sub par
✝️✝️✝️
Definitely looks like a fun story
Endless trash
Nice of the crowd to give him the space and silence for him to finishinf introducing himself
Idk
looks goofy
"Meh
*FROM THE DIRECTOR OF PADDINGTON*
Leans forward in seat"
"I love it!! Great trailer, Timmy as Willy is just 🥰"
The only Wonka I know lives in Scranton Pennsylvania.
It's so good to see Daniel Thrasher on the big screen.
"Finally, the origin story we've been waiting for."
Man Daniel Thrasher is really moving up in the world
"Calah Lane has the perfect everything for a possible Amanda The Adventurer movie. At 0:41, I heard Wooly (her sheep partner)"
Meh
dune part two looks wierd
there better be a post credit scene of charlie in it
Who else wonkin they willie rn? 😂🤪
Needs more black people in every scene. Just like the original. Pass.
All I needs was “from the director of Paddington” and I was in. Those movies were literal perfection.
That spice got Paul Atreides dreaming up some crazy stuff
This will bomb 💣
This a new key and peele episode?
This one is for the real Willy wonka from many years ago
"guys charlie and the choclate factory was my definitive childhood experience , the book and the movies god know how many times i have watched it , timothee and rowan atkinson , i am glad i am alive to see this , its gonna be great guys"
"Fun fact: in Russian, the title “Wonka” written in italics looks like “butt”😂"
how annoying to see Timothee. he acts in all movies. no more actors?
Жопка
looks somwhere between that horrendous rdj dolittle movie and the early hbo max original movies going straight to streaming
"I have high hopes for this film, but Timothée Chalamet was not the right casting choice"
He hasnt audition for a movie in years and it kind of shows.
Yeah it's a no for me. Timothys acting isn't good enough for Willy
I've got a great feeling about this :D
it magical
Reading through the comments and loving how everyone on here tried so very desperately to come up with something good to say.
This could be even better than Paddington 2. Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is genius casting
Johnny Depp did it best 😕
Johnny Depp is irreplaceable
Let’s be honest the Johnny Depp version sucked
No... just no. What an awful idea for a movie lol
"Oh look. Another butchering of a classic for another cheap cash grab. No matter what, they will never recreate the magic of the original gene wilder performance."
I predict a flop.
I'm just gonna say it.... I think I'm more hyped for the FNAF movie 😂
Nah...
Absolutely no one asked for this.
I love it 😻 baby mwah 😘
Nah… I’m good.
"Wuu, I’m already too excited! Can’t wait to see it!
Special congratulations to Timothée Chalamet, such a great actor 🎭"
Oh he reminds me of Gene
Just what Hollywood needs.  Another movie filled with bad CGI in EVERY shot.
"can't believe the poor taste of people in these comments. still, they probably lapped up the risible Depp drivelling on about 'candies'. Seems respect for the creators'  legacies gone in this era..."
"Johnny depp as Willy Wonka 
That visuals and movie are still in mind was the best at my childhood"
Awesome.
Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka. There will never be another.
"I hate every second of this.
Paddington was lovely but I don’t believe anyone asked for an origin story for Willy Wonka. The whole idea is that he was a mystery and that the stories about him may as well have been made up, until you get inside the factory and see for yourself."
Who wanted this movie?  This character and theme barely made the runtime of one movie.  Does WW have some huge fandom?
Finally a beautiful and brilliant movie being made again! Haven’t had one of those in a very long time.
"The moment I saw Rowan Atkinson, I liked it."
No one wants this.
I HATE THE ANTICHRIST
"If it's half as good as this trailer, I am ready"
would be better without the (sigh things that are there just to be there) but Ill watch it anyway :)
70 bucks he gives the factory and everything to the black girl side kick
Excited to see this!
OMG HUGH GRANT
Why does every damn movie need to have a prequel these days. It was bad enough with the first reboot.
I don’t think it looks very good 😂
The Roald Dahl Vibe be real 😍
"Всем мы знаем,что наша Жопка)"
"Oh, good. This fictional fantasy land is following DEI for modern audiences. Kinda weird that they gave him a slave girl, though."
Looks dreadful
Not Matt Lucas. 😂
This looks absolutely horrible but in a fun way. I’m looking forward to it
Жопка
Yikes this looks bad.
Gene Wilder was a bad bad man.
This feels like a prequel to the 2005 movie
Timothée Chalamet and the BBC TV allstars
Goofy era of Hollywood continues
without even watching the trailer. i can tell that it's gonna be a huge failure. HUGE FAILURE without mr.depp
Maaaaaaan Willy wonka suppose to be a man not a kid😫 imma pass on this one
So glad it's not another remake
Meh.
Who up wonking they willy right now? 🙏🏻 🔥
"Wow, he's white and the female side kick is a cool character and not annoying and/or political? That's crazy"
Paul atreides really like chocolate huh
Another one?...
This could be a horror film.
"I hopethis gives justice to Gene Wilder's version, which was a hard act to follow!"
why
Looks goofy
And I was wondering why he was dating Kylie Jenner 😂
A wholesome Wonka is a distortion and dilution of the book tho. But I'll watch it on a rainy day when I need a comfort watch.
This looks gorgeous & I Like gorgeous.
"havent watched the trailer yet, guessing its about willy wonka makin g his chcoolate factory as a businessman"
Holdup they got MR FUKN BEAN???
"Dont let this distract you from the original premise of C&tCF/WW which kills children, makes candy out of them and basically makes people eat other people unknowingly. Dahl, the creator/writer was perverse, sick subliminal type subversive content for ""children's"" books... Keep your kids away from all of his work as long as you can!"
And this connects to snowpeircer how?
O.M.F.G please tell me this is fake. This looks absolutely RIDICULOUS. why can't they leave the classic movies alone.
Paul King is gonna direct this film?!
"1:06 ""Is that normal chocolate you're making, Wonka?"""
Who up wonkin’ they willy tonight?
"Wow,, another remake."
Warner este año esta sacando puros éxitos taquilleros (sin DC)
Well I won’t be seeing that
2023 Christmas about to be lit
Am I the only one who feels like Timothy's protrayal isn't cooky enough ? 😮
i came for mr bean
Straight to DVD.
"Go on Chalamet
.... Keep making these amazing roles"
DOA. RIP Gene
"Damn man
U guys are like jihadist fighting for a dead course the movie was shot half a century ago
Move on or go rewatch it 
Whining in the comment section won't make this film any less real"
He's got Wilder's eyes.  Perfect
Жопка!
"But remember this. Spare those bees, Wonka. Ya gonna need them one day."
👍👏
"The Rowan Atkinson ""run away"" line gave me huge Blackadder throwbacks :')"
"When they said ""this Chrismas"", I thought why so late, but before we know it, it will already be winter😢"
no.
It's coming. I see a chocolate spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire. A chocolate that waves the Wonka banner in my father's name.
This movie looks so bad...
Pass…
"Why are they making another movie?
The original was the only good one!"
çooooooook heyecanlıyımm ana sayfamda bunu görunce ufak çaplı bir şok yaşadım
Looks like they removed the child murder from the story.  I might watch it
The movie we never wanted but the movie we needed
He can always use THE VOICE to order the oompa loompas
"I guess Hugh Grant will take any role now, even as an Oompa Loompa. 😁"
To be honest Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Chocolate ❤
so much better than seeing him get dumped by a hot blonde guy who ends up marrying a woman instead of him so yeah I'll definetely watch it
so average guy to play wonka....k
i swear willy wonka was british... acording to the book
"brb, i just gotta send this trailer to everyone i know"
"TC is no doubt a great actor, but no one can out-do and out-crazy Johnny's Wonka."
Rowan ❤
Rowan Atkinson ❤
When are they going to stop making remakes in actually start coming up with new film ideas? It's like they're just too lazy these days to make new film franchises that they just have to milk old ones. It's just so sad. The spirituality in filmmaking has just died off.
It's all fine other than Willy wonka seems to speak with an American accent?
"“An Oompa What-Now’?!”
ALLOW Me To ‘Refresh Your Memory.”
“Ooh, I Don’t Think I Wanna Hear That.”
“TOO LATE— I Stared Dancing Now, And ONCE We’ve Started We CAN’T Stop.”
XD 😄😄😆😁"
No.  Just no more. 😳
Looks like this version has definitely been black-washed!  No thanks
I don't know man....I want a cameo of Johny depp😢😢😢
OMG OMG OMG! I LOVE IT 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Im definitely seeing a movie about the life story of Willy Wonka featuring Mr. Bean.
Too American- they’ll just ruin the entire storyline 🙄
"okat, do i think this is silly. I think not. I acknowledge the efforts put into this movie. I do."
"Oh great, another woke remake! Is Holywood and the film industry just a mindless factory rehashing classic and well loved movies into boring, woke ghosts of their former selves?"
One thing that bothers me about these trailers is that they're always made to look and sound epic - and sometimes it just doesn't fit the vibe of the movie. This is a perfect example.
"Трейлер ""Жопки"" заканчивается тем, что человек показывает жопку))
Это какой-то новый вид иронии)"
Willy Woker
"But I will be honest, I’m a bit disappoint that this looks more like a children’s film than the crazy killer vibes that I got from watching Depp’s version. I hope it manages to recreate that vibe?"
"Oh Carson, this is so middle class."
"I had no idea I needed this...
And now I really wanna see it..."
Timothee never pulls a bad performance
Wanka
Ха ха. Жопка (простите)
The movie you say you’re going to see but never make it to the theater for
I don't believe him
SEATED
Nobody is  missing Johny depp?😢
I can't wait! The cast is insane! My jaw was on the floor throughout the video. Timothee has an extraordinary career going on.
"it looks sort of good... just not sure TC is the right actor for it tbh, even though I loved him in Dune"
Meh where johnny depp?
This looks great. I'll be looking forward to seeing this movie.
"They only did this cause ppl are refusing, to have anything to do with WB."
Too much of a child for me to believe anything the lil !@#$ says…. This is a joke.
"Fun Fact: Roald Dahl absolutely HATED the Gene Wilder version. Studio straight-up screwed him on multiple aspects of the film. This looking like a prequel to that version, I can definitely say he is fuming in his grave."
"Yes, not a disney. I'm watchin!"
Awful. Dahl will be rolling in his grave.
"Brilliantly Done Looks like a Family film with Heart . It's Awsome and funny. These are the movies the world needs, and a Stellar cast and well directed. The Paddington movies are joyful and happy so if Wonka is made by the people who made Paddington it's going to be a super exciting fun movie for everyone."
That had to be the fakest flying I've ever seen.  But Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa? OH GAWD YES PLEASE 🙏
Жопка
"i dont know, i just feel like timothy chalamet isnt crazy enough to be willy wonka, hope he can prove me wrong"
I am seeing this purely for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loop
"Another remake once again, how original. 🎉"
"Bruh when are they gonna make a ""Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator"" movie?"
i have a question is this sequel or reboot of Willy Wonka because I watched previous movie many times and johnny depp perfected that character
Would have been nice to see this at comic con. 😢
Looks like Milan that mall
"Everything here looks great, but Timothee has such a modern American voice which kind of takes me out of the magic. Am I the only that feels this way?"
"Not sure what I was expecting. I guess I was expecting more of an adventure film. An adventure where Wonka goes around to different parts of the world exploring different types of flavors for candy and different creatures and people. Feels a bit like a rehash of the original with the similar looking oompas and the flying. Oh well, not exactly too excited for this."
take my soul wonkaa !!!! 🥹😻
IT'S WONKIN' TIME!!!!
"Okay so Sally Hawkins and Hugh Grant in the same movie made by the Paddington Bear movie/Harry Potter Producer. 
So Does Paddington take place in the same universe? Cause that would make Paddington 3 really interesting..."
i have chocolate fatigue and i'm not talking about real chocolate
Вилли Жопка 💪
"On paper, I like the idea of this movie, I like the cast, and I should be impressed by the production values.  But something is feeling off to me.  It's not connecting.  It all feels very... sterile."
This looks lame af
Sally Hawkins and Hugh Grant...I'm in...
"They didn’t!
Edit: They did!"
That’s not Johnny depp! 😞
Looking forward to the orchestral Pure Imagination
i saw Rowan Atkinson it will be game changer and truly  Fantasy.
Dune 2 trailer is really taking some liberties with the source material
Yess great trailer so excited!
"How disappointing . . . Why can't they leave well enough alone, try a something new, quit ruining classics?"
I have no idea how I feel about this but at least it looks like they had a lot of fun making it
A film that has actual colors? I haven't seen something like that in years.
Final a hot person to play as Willy😢
Should have made the background music Pure Imagination
Trash
"It feels more like Timothéee Chalamet putting a fancy costume on than Willy Wonka, big no for me"
What is that weird accent he's doing?? There is only ONE Willy Wonka and that's Gene Wilder!!!!
I want to like this but largely I want to ask why this was made...
This looks really good. I've been waiting for this movie to be released for awhile now.
I needed the willy wonka hair tho 😔❤️‍🩹
"So wait, which movie’s timeline is this in? It seemed from most of the info that it’s a prequel to the Burton movie but it has the Stuard Oompa Loompah design"
Finally a glimpse of the movie I've been waiting for so long....
this is a joke has nothing to do with willy wonka
Not my Willy Wonka
"For a second I thought they wouldn't have oompa loompas, but the ending sold me"
Oh come Hollywood can't think of anything original
"Me: mmmh dunno 
*Sees ""from the makers of Paddington"" and Rowan Atkinson. And Hugh Grant. 
Me : OOMPA LOOMPA I WILL WATCH THIS MULTIPLE TIMES"
"1:07 “Is that… _normal_ pooing you’re doing, Mark?”"
"Prequels ,sequels,  reboots, remakes. Hollywood is dead."
It looks like Hugh Grant is gonna steal the show.
There’s only one Willy Wonka for me. Gene Wilder.
Wtf is this
We shall wait the 4 months .... with baited breathhhhhhhh !!!!! Dune comes around the same time ... delightful !!!!!
"We are out of ideas….
Next old yeller is buried in the pet cemetery. Or maybe air bud is a new cadet in the police force. Lethal bud- every dog has its day"
This is something that I didn't know I needed. This looks absolutely magical!
I will say this....they absolutely nailed it casting Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa!!!
Did I just saw Rowan Atkinson?
Wonka the woke man !?! 🎉😂❤
Before Willy Wonka meet Charlie..............
My only concern is that so much money has been thrown at the cast - I just hope enough was thrown where it matters.
2:08 why does Hugh Grant sound like the narrator from the Stanley parable?
I hope Roald Dahl would be please or not! (guess this would be my next Motion Picture surprise of the year!)
YES
I really hope This is not a musical
Did they get Greta Thunberg to play Veruca? lol
"Me : hmmm I have my doubts..then
1:42 Rowan Atkinson...
Me: OK! Sold!
😂😂😂"
this actually looks wholesome and like something made for people to genuinely enjoy. its unfortunate the dark history behind the original willy wonka story but pretty much every classic has a dark past we ignore.
I was excited until I saw Keegan Michael Key
Sounds (n acts) like #danielthrasher😄😄
Why?
This is really good 👍
"It has the Director of Paddington and
Producer of Harry Potter, and everything about this trailer looks interesting!
I'm especially curious about that giraffe.
🍫🦒🎩
I'll have to see this."
"Well, it got me laughing so it's got to be worth something."
Wowwwwww
I’m giggling like a little kid already🥹. “ Now quiet up and listen down—scratch that—reverse it!”
"Given that we have no idea who this girl is, I ask ahead of time: how tragic will her death be?"
ЖОПКА)
why is this necessary?
After all these years❤️ thank you for this
Willy Wonka: Arrakis
This is not looking good. The acting is really missing something.
I wasn't interested in this movie at all until Hugh Grant showed up as an Oompa Loompa.  Touché.  I'll be there opening night.
Willy Wonka meets Newt Scamander!? I am here for it. 😢🎉
Wow ❤❤❤❤
Missing Jhonny Depp 🙁
Looks like a great movie. Very inclusive too. I crave candy now though
I think that us having an origin of Willy Wonka is a great idea
im wondering how Warner Bros can ruin a perfectly good story?
looks like a fun origin experience we never got to see.
I have no idea whether this will be good or legit awful
"This is a feel good movie
God knows we need one 
After a summer of CGI mess!"
This looks terrible.
Where’s Gene Wilder
Actually this looks like it slaps
Can't wait to see how he lost his sanity to the point he mutilated children.
Garbage.
Tim's certainly no Gene. They seem to have managed a Roald Dahl with barely an English accent.
Вилли Жопка 😏
ug.😮‍💨
So take a classic book and remeberence of a classic 1970s movie and twist it completely. Fan fiction at it's worst.
If you're actually excited about this film you need to get a life
Its tough to imagine other person as willy wonka rather than johny depp...
I think this is gonna be a decent movie. If the music and acting is good it’s going to be great. The acting looks good but we’ll have to see about the music.
Wonder how woke chocolate is
Saruman/Count Dooku/Dr. Wonka would have been proud.
Absolutely not
I think they should call it `Willy Woka'.
This looks soooo much better than that over-the-top monstrosity created by Tim Burton.
Who all ❤️ Roald Dahl books?🎉🎉🎉
Should have had Mr. Beast as one of the villains with Feastables XD
Oh my god. Good luck. Your going to need all the luck in the world. This will be worse movie of the year!!!
A trailer with pure imagination. I love it! Can't wait to see it.
Timothée Chalamet will play a space overlord in dune part 2 and a candy overlord in wonka
"Omg, another film that shows this ""diversity"" by inserting black actors into the film in order to show that they are a society with racial differences and blah blah , even though the truth is something else. (And yes, I know that these events and the story are fictional, but the concept of racially different characters shows a society that is accepting and full of differences and coexistence, and this is very ridiculous and doesn't work when it comes to these types of movies) Oh WoW a European society in the 19th century where White, black, asian... are coexist and live harmony! 😀"
Жопка 👌
Looks potentially better than the Tim Burton movie.
Woke Wonka
"This feels like a magical dream of a child that should never end. The trailer just introduced me to Wonka who is enthusiastic, fun-loving, knows his art and the best thing knows a lot about chocolate  Yummfiy me with this delicious journey of Wonka can not wait for the full movie to be released."
"And every bad thing started with a nightmare, and I have nightmares.... all night long and all day long."
CANT WAITT
this awesome! can we have a Wonka 2 already? hahahaha
"I'm a fairly cynical person when it comes to reboots etc, but this actually has a really fun, sincere, festive vibe. Seems like it will be a good time"
"A woke Charlie and the chocolate factory is just what the world needs right now.
Thanks Warner👍"
I hope there are songs in the movie
This looks fantastic! I know it doesn't open til Christmas but I would like a golden ticket now.
It looks fun!
It'd be dope if Johnny made a guest appearance
'no daydreaming' got to me 💀
COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW…!!!!!  Don’t you have ANY creative people on your staff??
"They even used a lyric from the theatre musical 

...salute!"
Willy Wanka
"This looks so cute, funny, endearing, sweet (pun not intended) and so much more, and we have Timothée Chalamet as lead and is that Mr Bean??!!! This feels like an honest intent to honor the source material instead of making a prequel/sequel/remake just because nostalgia is easy"
0:41 Me when I finally get a girlfriend.
The wonka trailer looks great I am definitely going to watch it when it comes out
The man the myth the legend Rowan Atkinson has returned
YES WE FINALLY GET HIS BACKSTORY!!!
Well we’re out of ideas.
Boy Paul’s been hitting the spice hard!
it’s giving happy kaz brekker lmfao
Is it a prequel to Tim Burton’s charley and the chocolate 🍫 factory 🏭 or original version?
"This doesn't just look interesting, it looks fabulous. We need more films in the same vein as Wonka.
I will probably watch this one on the big screen."
YES I LOVE IT AND ITS MY CHILD HOOD MOVIE
"Literally clicked on this so fast, it was satisfyingly unexpected"
Am I the only one who thinks that Timothée Chalamet looks like Daniel Thrasher?
"No thanks.  This looks unbelievably bad.  I'd rather watch the Johnny Depp one over this abomination, and that's saying something."
Craving chocolate after watching this 🍫
How many times said chocolate in this movie?😂
I dont really care about this movie but I did not expect to see Mathew Baynton
"Roald Dahl would absolutelly hate this, even for his grave."
They should have casted MrBeast as Willy Wonka💀💀💀
This actually looks quite charming.
no depp seems like amber won after all.
I loved the part of this movie where Johnson makes an indecent proposal
"So, does this take away acting opportunities away from little people?"
Love the tagline
Timothee Chalamet as a wacky goofy magical character? SIGN ME TF UP
Only because the titles mention Paddington.
I will watch this only for Mr. Bean
Why is this movie?
"Scratch that , reverse it.....bit of a nod to Gene Wilder maybe?"
It was a very good two minute movie
Meh movie.
I don’t know—I can’t be the only one hoping that this Wonka will be similar to Johnny Depp’s Wonka. That Wonka was deliciously devious..
I mean props to everyone involve who really tried but this uh…doesn’t look great
Not a fan of chalamet being wonka
I HOPE THIS MOVIE  ON NEFLEX BEACASE THIS GONNA BE  AMSING
You guys are out of ideas and it’s so apparent this movie will flop
This is wonderful! I wonder what Roald Dahl would think of this if he were alive to see it.
ЖОПКА
this looks epic
No one can match johnny deep as willy wonka
Im bout to wonka my willy
Oompa Loompa's Can talk properly without singing?!?!?!?! I never thought I needed to know that!!!😁😁😁
Don't need to see it but it looks cute and hope others enjoy it. Looks to have similar charms at Paddington and has a great cast.
yo so when does wonka commit genocide against and enslave Loompaland? so hyped for that scene!
Hmmm looks good.
Waiting for WONKA'S Another CHOCOLATE FACTORY 😊💯🔥

"Ollie Wonka, I have missed you so much!! Glad you're back! <3"
no sky beam ? damnn
I will be seated. 🍿
i was rolling my eyes through this entire trailer....until i saw hugh grant...and now i have to see the movie...
They played the flute jingle from the 1970’s version of Willy wonka . Now that’s attention to detail.
Yeah this looks incredible.
Like who they casted as wonka
Timothee is a Bad cast…seems forced..not natural
i am optimistic of this film striking a fine balance of being anti-protectionist without being anti-labor
Timothee chalamet is trying too hard
OOMPA LOOMPA🔥🔥🔥
Oscar on the way....
Finally something original.
"Oh, this one is special"
would be awesome if Johnny Depp played this role
"Офигенно 👏
Ждёмс"
No.
Bring back Johnny Depp
"Michael scott : There is no movie called 'Willy Wonka' ! 
Dwight : Well, there is 😏"
Noooooooo
"Atleast we can watch,  what we wanted to ❤🍬🍫🍭"
Another childhood movie....butchered.
NOT ROWAN ATKINSON AAAAAAA IM CRYINGGGGGGG
"I don't think people get that this is a prequel? It looks good, but I have a bad feeling that they're going to use a ton of CGI, but atleast it doesn't look as bad as Tim Burton's version"
"Might just be me but it feels somewhat forced, hopefully it feels more natural as the movie progresses, specifically the “nutty” part to me felt as such lol"
"W . W ?
Everything reminds me of breaking bad🥺"
I'm actually shocked that Willy Wonka is not black
Did anyone remember Willy Wonka's whistle to the Oompa Loompas at the end?
This just put a smile on my face!!!
"Yes, Yes, YES!"
I hope it’s just a fun movie with out some kind of social justice message attached. Also hoping to not see some “outrage” over Hugh Grant stealing movie roles from a little person(s).
I just happy to see Mr Rowan Atkinson lmao
why december dats way too long
Johnny depp one is better
Damn i still cant move on from JD wonka 😅
"I admit I'm a little skeptical about this prequel film. Nevertheless, seeing Willy Wonka say his famous ""Scratch that, reverse it"" line and the introduction of the Oompa Loompas and their whistle theme has given me a sense of nostalgia. Perhaps this film will actually surprise me."
I didn't catch half of the things they were saying because I was chuckling and grinning the whole time. It looks lovely!!
"This looks so good, I cannot wait! 🔥"
Am i the only one who doesnt get this chin face kid ?
"*I'm surprised they didn't ""swap"" Wonka out with... Jada Pinkett Smith, or maybe Oprah... better yet... Woopie Goldturd!*"
This feels so grandiose and fun
another movie ruined by this twink
"I mean it's not like the original but it looks pretty good, i will definitely watch it."
Definite Fantastic Beasts vibes coming from this!
❤❤❤Rowan Atkinson ❤❤❤
This actually looks really really good
ITS HERE!!🤩
"Not sure , I like the actor but Johnny had it much uniquely and far more Special.  Some times it’s just not a good idea to re- Act on a legendary act."
well thats a yup :)
I always got the johnny depp's vibe from him and now this!!!!!
"I think Chalamet is a great actor, but I just see an actor doing actor stuff and not Wonka.  :("
I thought that Willy Wonka was played by @danielthrasher for a sec 🤣
WHY WHY WHY do they keep doing repeats of these movies !!!!!!   It's very rare that the original can be outdone.    Look at the mess with all the Predator sequels!!!!!!!.
Bad casting
WE HAVE 2 MOVIES ALREADY
i cant wait 🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉 ima react 2 this movie
my timmy
...why do they use this music?
"So basically, Willy Wonka is a genius scientist who could have been anything he wanted but decided to make all of his inventions chocolate-based? Great. Which character’s backstory are they gonna ruin next?"
This looks SO fun!
"Ye kya likha hai news me ki ""Ab ghodo ki race me gadhe nhi daudenge""."
Cautiously Optimistic
mr beannnnnnn
Why do I feel that this movie is going to have so many memes come from it?
"Looks good, but nothing will beat the 1971 version."
NO
"I can’t picture Timothy as a crazy person. He seems like he is trying so hard to be Wonka but I’m not buying it. However, he does have to follow up after Johnny Depp which would be hard to do. He should have let Timmy Tim loose again."
"Not scary enough , I was hoping he was gonna be creepy"
and not a single mexican around...
"Nah, its not even close to johny depps version"
Another one….
Could do without the half assed and shoehorned in Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory references
"I wanna watch it just cos I like chocolate lol 

But then again I also like the Wonka films lol"
didnt realize willy wonka was 12
Are there any other young actors than Chalamet? So tired of seeing him everywhere.
фильм Жопка надо будет обязательно посмотреть
Willy Wonka keeps getting younger everytime they make a new movie. He has the Spiderman curse.
"Rather than Timothy, imagine had they brought back Freddie Highmore as the lead"
Mr bean???
Why oh why do we need another version of this film? Who signs off on these? What an absolute waste of money.
ALL THE FIRST COMMENTS ARE BOTS. They even copy/pastes similar comments exactly in some cases lol
Willy wonka won't feel the same without Johnny Depp
Oh non ça va être une 💩 woke
OMG
Hugh Grant was a truly inspired choice
Do we really need this movie?
For me ..i think it's not gonna be great like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
"oompa loompas have always been weird side characters for me but they sure are funny. ""once we've started, we can't stop"""
that's not willy wonka
WE'RE SO BACK
Timotee is just not likeable as an actor. He’s a pretty boy like tom cruise with none of the charisma. This will flop.
"His agent really said hey Boi your a big star RN, let's make you Wonka for no reason.
Please leave Gene Wilders Wonka alone already ☹️ and give us new film ideas, there's a writers strike, I bet there are hundreds of homeless in Hollywood with great stories they are trying to sell, and they think we need another Wonka Smh."
Nah. Shamalamadingdong is such an overrated actor. This movie will get a 40% metascore
Is that the prequel to the movie that came out several years ago?
Imagine MrBeast being Willy Wonka
Wasn’t that Loompas from another land and they were being hunted?
This looks cute I'm excited 💜🍫
Rowan Atkinson 
Bloody Wonka. Brother of Coomer.
"Whys he american, and whys he Timothee 😭"
0:46 Strong af Gene Wilder vibes
"i think it’d be really cool if this movie harkens back to the source material, like maybe some of wonka’s naysayers are named “madame salt” or “mr. beauregarde” or something"
"very good 

🤢🤢🤮🧐😰😰😰😨😨😨😨😦😦😯😯🤯😴😷😎"
I just reading the book again and this pops up
"this is such a fresh take on this story
something we never imagined but deep down always wanted
can’t wait to watch❤"
"*DON'T BE WOKE... DON'T BE WOKE... DON'T BE WOKE!!!*
(@0:50... welp, i hope this flops harder than ""The Little Swap-Maid"")"
Who up wonking they willies
"Well, this is unexpecting"
Wonka should be Ezra Miller.
It's great to see how well Johnny Depp has laid a foundation of a character so well that actors today try to immitate it
Then he became a murderer 😐
Ooooo so it's a prequel to the Gene Wilder version. Love it!!!!
"Johnny Depp is in the desert, clad in leather head to toe, wearing a Central Park carriage driver cap and 6 lbs of guy liner , playing power chords badly on a Les Paul as the camera rolls. The big reveal: “ManStank Paris, for the gentleman not afraid to raaaawk.”  

“How many more cologne commercials we shooting today.”  

“Ahem, mr depp, I think you should see this.”  Views the new Wonka trailer and goes full Pete Townsend on his axe and amp.  “WTF? Didn’t they know I’m available? Is it too late? We can reschedule those Applebees commercials and the jungle cologne ad. Is his leather more than a bit ripe?”   

“Ripe is charitable, we’re weeks past ripe, here spray this on it. And here, more eyeliner will make you feel better.”"
meh...
"Oh, no. I don't feel he's as charming as he's acting to be. Yuck."
i can already tell im really going to hate this 💀💀
Finally a good looking remake of a classic
Idk if I wanna see this or not
But Johnny Depp's will wonka is irreplaceable
I'm gonna watch this just for mr bean❤
"This already looks good, I love the fact that there is another twist on wonka’s story and origin. As seen in the credits of the people working on this film it says there director of paddington and the producer of Harry Potter are working on this so I’m expecting big things from them since those films are loved by many"
sucks I wish there is a vote down option
Hugh Grant  as the Oompa Loompas laugh me!! XD
"I was critical of Timmy at first but the message really brings a tear to my eye. We really do need to all remember how to dream again, and what’s at stake when we don’t!"
I thought Village Roadshow was done making movies with Warner after Village Roadshow sued WB for The Matrix 4 being a box office bomb but I guess I was wrong

How'd he get off that sand planet?
nice i like it picasso
They should have stopped after the first one
sucks and bad casting
Wait what the mom from the Charlie and chocolate factory 2008 ???!?
This movie feels unnecessary... It's all there in the original. This modified version is bleh bleh bleh...
This actually looks incredible 🎉
DIVERSITY IS OUR GREATEST STRENGTH
"The trailer ends at 1:15.
Thank you"
Oh for f*ck sake can we PLEASE quit it with the reboots.
"Who all misses Johnny Depp?

Paul Atreides starts a chocolate factory after successfully taking back Arrakis from the Harkonnen's control with knowledge of the spices secrets.
I am so ready this movie! Timothee is gonna give this role his all and he’s gonna make many Charlie and the chocolate factory and Willy wonka fans happy! I loved the novel by Roald Dahl so I’m excited for this!
This looks so so good 😊
"""I'm something of a magician myself"" I can see a meme out of this already."
So England is 50% black now? Such horseshit.
It’s wonkin time then he wonked all over the place.
Hugh Grant - CGI face needs work…. it does not move naturally with the head
I’ve been waiting for this for over an entire year! Freak yes!
"Oh yay another minority thats the real brains behind the character, coz the character is a bumbling oaf that cant do anything on their own. How original"
When you Hollywood dipshits going to actually create something? Gonna be hilarious watching this trash bomb
this guy again? I mean there are other actors
OSCAR CAMPAIGN STARTS NOWWWWWWWWWWW

Why is there always a black kid in every movie now?
my childhood star mr bean (rowan atkinson) is Back 😍
"looks boring AF but if your an 8 year old that isnt very smart, then this looks perfect for you."
Absolutely NONE of the magic that Gene Wilder brought to the role. This looks bland and boring 🥱🥱
Gonna watch it on my birthday - 27 December 😊😊😊
"just noticed mister bean himself is the priest, lolol"
"Oh, this made me so happy!"
Hehe its wonking time baby!
It’s Mr. Bean
This looks magical.
"charlie and the chocolate factory, the best book and the best movie of my childhood. Hollywood is magic."
He found the perfect role for himself!!! I wish we could erase him from Dune LMAO
"Its just Tim in a Wonka costume, his acting isnt doing it for me"
Love you Timmy ❤
dont say it is gonna be musical
Support @ Ben The Don
again?!
"The decadence of Hollywood strikes again. Super-hero movies, remakes, reboots... Don't you see people are tired of all that?"
The Snow Piercer prequel we didn't know we needed.
Ummmmm where is Jhonny Depp ???
"My jaw just dropped watching Timothée Chalamet effortlessly be Willy Wonka😮
I am here for it🔥"
"Screenwriter/producer - check out this original screenplay, it’s very good

Hollywood studios - no thanks, we’ll just make another movie based on old established IPs again. The writing is done for us. We just cash the check"
Love love love ❤❤❤
The Chocolate Cartel.. Lmao love it!
That looks absolutely terrible

"does not look good… the issues do not seem too large for him to over come

"If Willy is secretly a wizard, that explains all the weird stuff you do after eating his candy."
"Iba a lanzar un meh, pero ese ""Piensalo, pero en reversa"" y ya me he ido a la versión de Gene Wilder. Ya solo necesito un poco de esa sensacion de 'no me importuna nada y estoy en control de mi insana locura' que tenía el Wonka de Wilder y el personaje será redondo."
Ok midjourney now replace timothée chalamet with anyone else
"No offense to Timothy, but Johnny Depp immortalized this role. Why remake?"
UGGH ANOTHER BAD REMAKE OF AN ORIGINAL CLASSIC
boring by the looks of it…at least the Tim Burton version had originality
Jonny depp is best
is this the snowpiercer prequel?
"So, you don’t want to hire little people?  Got it, Willy Woke-a"
okay im literally so excited.
This looks fantastic! It looks like a proper good movie. I thought we stopped making those?
HE IS FINALLY HERE
Reminds me of The Greatest Showman and Emily Blunt's Mary Poppins rolled up in one
"I normally say that we don’t need yet another origin story when we got what we already have with two Chocolate Factory movies out but this one? I actually quite like the trailer! Plus, I haven’t seen Paddington yet and I feel ashamed for that but I heard that it was great. I have no doubt the same people who made that movie will make this movie great too!"
"actually i dont know, everything seems a little too forced. Hugh Grant though, he just sold me the ticket to this movie."
"No one can do this better than Depp, it's like he was born to play such characters."
I hope this movie is gonna be like greatest showman and full of emotions and memorable moments
no
"another woke ""inclusive"" film that feels overhyped and forced. passssss"
"Greatest chocolate shop the world has ever seen, proceeds to shut it off. Will they retcon the books?"
"yes, I need to see this, especially if it's gonna be a musical."
awww this looks really good!!!!
Looks really fun!
"This isn’t really my kind of movie, but I adore Timmy so much, I’ll watch anything he’s in. And only he could wear that costume and still be the most beautiful boy in the world. ❤️"
"The story of how one man overcame a cartel to become a chocolate monopoly, built on disregarding local labour laws, ignoring food safety testing, and institutionalising a culture promoting workplace standards violations."
More?
At least they got the Oompas' look right again.
Soo much originality these days.
2:14 Why is the Oompa Loompa trapped
I swear 1 of the guys is of horrible histories
why is he Daniel Thrasher
This looks so good
who up wonkin their willy rn
Missing Johnny Depp
I can totally see me bawling my eyes out with this one
This is going to be Delightful!!!
I'm something of a magician myself
This actually looks so good 😄
Hey look look 1:02
"Dat boy, TC don't miss!"
"Looks like trash, Depp’s is still superior"
Is that my guy Matthew baynton?
'From the director of Paddington' is all the assurance I need.
1:50 So... Willy and Paddington are brothers ❤
Ooooooh! I cannot wait for this to come out!
Eagerly waiting❤❤
Hugh Grant being the Oompa Loompas is the best thing 😭
This already immediately looks better than Charlie & And The Chocolate Factory 🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩🤩
Timothee is channeling his inner pedo in this movie
IS THAT ROWAN ATKINSON??? 1:02 1:41
Why?
Getting real tired of these soulless cash grabs that play off nostalgia.
"We can only hope Timothee Chalamet’s performance is just as batsh*t and demented as Johnny Depp’s 😂 


I can tell this is going to be a trainwreck. Wouldn’t spend a cent to watch it."
I was hoping it was gonna be more of a dark turn since it has potential but this seems existing too.

This is going to be the biggest flop movie of the year.this is a big disrespect for the movie..our childhood is going to be ruined.😥
Looks stupidly good 👍
"Oh my! Hugh Grant! Can't wait. Thank you for sharing. Greetings from Essex, UK."
Pass
This looks like an absolutly awful movie
Why?
"I see Rowan Atkinson, I run to the cinema 😂"
WAS THAT ROWAN ATKINSON FR???
Mr Bean... Of sacred chocolate
"""Oh nooo....."" : / This is nothing like the Gene Wilder Wonka.."
Ain’t no way
"Looks promising. Also, Hugh Grant as a dancing, and hopefully, singing Oompa-Loompa is a must-watch."
"didn’t really think this was gonna be anything but this has captured the Roald Dahl vibe better than anything else I’ve seen since the original Chocolate Factory, plus its directed by the Paddington guy"
Part of what makes the original film magical was the mystery behind the whole factory. Giving wonka a fully fleshed out back story just to cash in on making wonka chocolate again ruins that magic.
"guys, i have a new crush"
"I was already enjoying the charming and wistful style of the start of the trailer, but when I saw it’s being directed by the same guy from Paddington, my excitement for this increased by tenfold!"
Why…
This the prequel to Gene Wilder’s Willy Wonka.
He has the spirit of gene
This looks good!
And REALLY cool that they tweaked and added from the book story where Charlie is a black poor child
Great! Not another woke movie. I'll definitely watch it!
I am deeply triggered by one thing about this movie - that Christmas is too far away a release date.
Looks a *Lot Better* than Depp's outing. Paying more homage to Gene Wilder's influence as the legendary chocolatier and confectioner.
"Hmmm because of propganda nowadays I hate movies where there are multi race, unless it's modern world.

Either be black or white or Asian.

Propganda ruin the movie.

Of course I am not blaming this movie."
Is Armie Hammer not going to be in this?
"I'm getting real ""Jared Leto trying too hard to be Joker"" vibes from this trailer, and I'm hoping it's just bad takes or misrepresented.

Timothee is intensely talented, and I am sure he can put more effort into sounding more like the absolutely nutty young Wonka he is trying to portray, a prime example is when he is asking the girl what kind of chocolate she likes, the last one feels way too ""acted"", like its a guy trying to purposefully act kooky, not a guy who *is* kooky.

Ah well, hoping it's just out of context, or bad takes, and I hope that I am pleasantly surprised when it releases, I really want this to be good and hope Timothee gets a chance to really act in this film and portray a truly nutty Wonka"
I'm surprised new Willy Wonka isn't a POC woman
This looks bad
Go girl give us nothing!!
The acting is a bit cringe if you recently just watched the Johnny Depp's one
Just. Make. New. Content.
What's with all the remakes these days
Should’ve been Jeremy Allen White. Timmy seems weak
"This is not a very good trailer. It feels like a long-forgotten generic 1990s kids film. That said, that last scene gives me hope that the movie itself will be much better than this exhausting, joyless trailer."
Jonka - Put on a Forward Roll
timothee never does bad in my eye
"4k, good job WB"
are they going to assasinate willy wonka
I love you wonk
Why its sounds like candy crush 😅
My favorite movie as a kid and a grown adult. Looking at this makes me appreciate Gene Wilder even more. Nothing against this kid but you can see its not even close.Wilder was unique and didn't have to try hard. This looks forced.
I don't like the actor ... somtehing is odd
Can't believe any white person would subject themself to this.
Ok I was unsure about all of it up until the Oompa Loompa part. Now I am pleased.
N… no.
Ok I was unsure about all of it up until the Oompa Loompa part. Now I am pleased.
I am smiling and giggling because I feel so much joy from watching this whimsical trailer that I am now looking forward to seeing.  I felt like I was a kid again and that is a great feeling to have right now. I cannot wait for this movie. 😊
"Christ, I lasted 30 seconds. Can't anyone come up with something even remotely original?  Remakes, prequels, sequels...no wonder big budget films keep failing at the box office."
I saw him filming in Oxford!
wait I thought this was a sequel to the remake not a prequel...ughhhhhhhhh noooooooo
Oky this actually seems good
"But why, the mystery of who is Willy Wonka is essential to his character"
Brought to you by the same company that fired Depp without due process and stood by Amber Heard to the very end. No thank you.
"Ahhh so this is a wonka film done right, nothing against Johnny just this is less mental asylum more nutty chocolate confectioner"
i see Mr bean i know which part of the movie ill be watching
"Bro ngl this looks like it will be fun af, the humor is on point too, haha keep it poppin!"
Was that Mr. Bean being chased by a giraffe?
What a great cast 😂😂😂😂
i love this so exciteddddddddd......this is one of my fav stories
MR BEAN?!? WE WILL BE WATCHING
Oh they were fr about this… LMAO
"Nice idea,  wrong actor.  But i do hope it's good."
Cela manque de woke !
"Looks very, very promising!"
Timothee should stick to soft-spoken roles. His voice is too thin to do anything this shouty.
This gives off big wonk energy
No ideas left in Hollywood i see
Great. Another remake of a remake. So inspired.
looks amazing.
It's good but watching it i just think of the old johnny deep willy wonka... Miss him
"Woooooooooow, this looks bad. Gean Wilder rolls in his grave."
1:42 mr bean
1:15 I don’t know why but I thought of Gene Wilder when I saw Timothee’s expression 🥹❤
Mr Beast already did this
Is this an origin story of the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka!?
Will honestly be going mainly to see Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa.
So excited for this!
Johnny Depp always!
Rowan Atkinson?! Did I see that right?!
"I saw one source saying that Jim Carter was playing Arthur Slugworth, but from this trailer I think it must be Paterson Joseph playing him instead."
"Yes, There is another Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and it is Wonka."
OH MY GODDDD
WTF
"Jontron: One of each, please. Lol 0:21"
No thank you
The last 2 months of 2023 belongs to Timmy Champagne! 😆
Hope not another woke film
a story of a hobo. Nice
My man Lance is in it! 🫠
DOGSHIT.
Since when they started filming? I saw the behind the scenes pictures back in 2019 someone pleases explain
Remembering you sir Johnny Depp
Just seeing Sally Hawkins my heart got warm! Such an incredible and talented actress!
Ohhh se ve súper genial !!! definitivamente que ansias de verla!
cool.
"Thank GOD they didn't do the Johnny Depp thing and try and reboot a new Wonka universe. This one clearly is trying to share the same world, music, catch phrases, and Oompa Loompas with the superior Gene Wilder original. Much smarter choice!"
"No. How many times can they remake this?! Jeez
The original should have never been remade....like most originals.
There are no original ideas anymore."
Wanka
"Oh look like a new willy wonka movie, but yeah, I mostly like the Johnny Depp version of Mr Wonka. You know, his personality always makes me smile and laugh😂👍. Also, the five kids that win five golden tickets play a very important role in the movie; but when I saw this new Wonka movie, five kids did, including me sad imagine if they were part of this movie, it's gonna be the best part and their evil personality, especially Veruca Salt and violet Beauregard also Augustus gloop always eating chocolate😂😂."
Rowan Atkinson omgg 🤣🤣🤣
Надо обязательно дождаться .
"1:43 
Every good thing in this world started with a dream. And with dream, comes responsibility."
Please don't have a running time of 3+ hours.  I need a 90 minute version
When the actor playing Willy effing Wonka is the least funny person on the cast....
Жопка)
What a wonderful and magical Christmas present 😍🥳🌟🫶
"no thanks
1. no real Oompa Loompas
2. A diversity hire"
The flute tune and the oompa loopa tune played at the end is the exact same one from the 1971 movie. Amazing.
Жопка
I’m only watching this movie for the homie Augustus Gloop
SO EXCITING
"I was so skeptical about this, thinking we didn’t really need another Wonka movie…but this trailer definitely changed my mind."
Is their only 1 kid in this movie? Where are the rest of them. They were the best part of the original
No Cavities? 🦷 *boom sfx
"Is no one tired of remakes, reboots, and sequels?"
"looks like the kind of movie that younger me would be completely obsessed with, loved it 🤩"
At Least Johnny Depp wasn't Returning to the Sequel or Something Like That?
The actual movie looks good but the actual actor for Willy wonky does not fit
"Tbh I can’t hate this kid 
He’s acting is top class for being my age lol
Cants wait for dune part 2"
Where is depp
This is probably what you dream of when you're high on Melange.
"Chalamet can play Wonka, but he can't voice him. His voice just doesn't fit right, idk why"
Can't stand having Chalamet being rammed down my throat by Hollywood no more.
Жопка
Another movie of Willy Wonka???
"Timothee is gonna be brilliant in this, incredible actor"
TIMOTHEEEEEEEE
More like WONKER
noice
No
Timothée is gonna knock this out of the park
"This looks awful


An Sally Hawkins in this after she played Charlie Buckets mother in Tim Burtons version of  Charlie and The Chocolate Factory will be confusing for some."
It should be banned sugar is harmful
Timothée Chalamet was born for this role!
ÇOK HEYECANLANDIM
so many bots in the comments paid for by Hollywood to promote yet another rendition of an old IP but whatevs
Who agrees Timothee Chalamet did an amazing job??? ❤
"I am very excited about this movie, especially since my favorite actor is the main character !!!!!!!! 😍😍🥰🥰"
Can we just like not ruin classic movies and let them just stay classic? This is just gonna flop.
Жопка
So a prequel....
Жопка ☺️
THE GIRAFFE?!?!!
Hmm ... Maybe this will be worth watching im cinema
Nope. I like Timothee Chalamet. He definitely looks the part of a young Willy Wonka but he doesn't act the part and I'm not interested in seeing a young Wonka film. Sorry. I still got the original.
CANT WAIIT
aaaaaaa ⬆️ me encanta
I only have one word for this trailer why
Jesse Eisenberg would've been better
"so funny cuz to lily rose depp, her ex and her dad played the same role lol"
Seeing this guy all happy and jollywrapper after seeing him suffer in sheer torture for 20 episodes straight in Dune is such a weird experience lol
ok im sold
Can't wait and hope this will be a good fun musical as The Greatest Showman.
Oh Timmy boy is sucha charm. <3
good
"0:21
dark ?
you meant black chocolate?..

oops.."
new movie concepts are really gone
LAAAAAAAAAAAAME
This better have some help with Dahl’s family members or it won’t be good
I miss Gene Wilder’s dry sarcastic wit. The fact that a chocolate factory owner was so sarcastic and a trickster really added a depth that he had seen so much in his life. I hope this movie bridges the gap between bright eyed optimist and sarcastic pseudo cynic
A must see.....
Wow this looks terrible
No daydreaming got me lolol😂
"Other than a glimpse of Rowan Atkinson and a bit of Hugh Grant, this looks horrifically bad.  Come on filmmakers - sequels, remakes, prequels.... is all originality gone in your profession?"
Can't wait timothiiiiii
This looks like a very charming and uplifting movie
No one need an orgin story for a mysterious character since thats what makes them appealing and especially not of a slave owner......
Can't wait! Hugh Grant will be amazing Oompa Loompa :D
Why is it so hard for Keegan-Michael Key to not appear in some green screen budget fantasy family movie
ちょっとティモシーさん軽め😅
Nostalgia 😢 To be honest i didn’t expect it to be good! Seems like they outdid themselves 😍 very impressive trailer! Definitely watching this one
here before 1M vies
Hmmm 🤔

"Nice to see that hollywood is now finally making some real content, I am bored of the superhero films now"
Got to fill the narative and have half the cast black.
"I love seeing Timothee Chalamet take on a more fun role, can’t wait!"
this is cinema
I still can't believe mr bean the tv show (1990) only has 1 season and yet everyone and their mother know who mr bean is
Se ve terrible.En el peor de los sentidos.
My inner child is happy!!🤍🥺
"I like Timothee Chalamet and this looks like another winner for him. Casting looks fantastic. That ending with the Oompa loompa 😂. ""Too late. Ive started dancing now. Once we've started, I can not stop.""😂😂😂"
yikes...
“Here we go mama“ ❤ 1:52
"Is this a musical ?? 
Like they sing and dance for any little sentence ?? 
Sing about "" I got gum in my shoe ""  . 
If not , looks whimsical and colorful. Nice cast ."
Watching this
Жопка 😂
The collaboration we never knew we needed Harry Potter and paddington ❤️
There are so many magical/fantasy movies coming out this year and I LOVE IT!!!
He does his Ace Ventura impression at :23 seconds.
To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Mr bean? 1:41
"For those of you who don’t know, Paul King, the director of the Paddington movies, is a master at his craft. I hope this is really good. 🙏"
Oh how I miss Johnny depp here...he made the previous movie the most sweetest one..
"really hope this little model won't ruin the Wonka by his... playing. unfortunately in this trailer he does ruin it, hope it's just bad trailer"
"oddly looks good and dare i say it, not woke?"
"So......huh.  I don't know.  If they nail the sense of delight this might work.  TC is not a bad choice for a young Willy Wonka.  I love the book and the Tim Burton  ""Charlie and the Chocolate Factory"" film.  And while I love Gene Wilder and his performance, I did not care for the ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory."" So, I am coming from a literature fan perspective."
"I'm pretty mixed on this trailer, some parts I like, others not so much.
I like the angle of Wonka's struggle against Slugworth, Finkelgrubber and Prodnose, the costume design on them (and everyone else) is pretty fantastic. (although did Matt Lucas have to be in this?)

I sort of like how they seem to be balancing the UK vs US issue that previous iterations have had. The book editions for the UK and US were different so it's hard to definitively say where Wonka's factory is. Here they seem to have dialled up the American accent for Willy, but have him striving to make a name for himself in the UK, what with all the British actors in the rest of the trailer.
The effects are looking a little weird at the moment though, a bit reminiscent of the 2020 adaptation of The Witches. And I can tell that the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa is going to be my next sleep paralysis demon.

For an unnecessary prequel it looks like it will be decent. The Paddington films are quite beloved, so having most of the makers on for this seems like it'll work too. Just hope they throw in a bit of darkness that Roald Dahl is iconic for. Maybe they'll have to kill off the new friend character of Willy to explain why she's never mentioned in the original stories (it's the curse of a prequel).
Also wondering how this film will end, since Slugworth and the others are (if my memory serves me correctly) still in business even when Wonka is older, so presumably they can't be fully taken out of the chocolate industry by the end of this film?


Also minor nitpick, bit strange how Wonka makes hoverchoc when he's young, but Fizzy lifting drinks weren't yet being sold to the public by the time he's an older man. Maybe the hoverchoc ends up disastrous and he gets in trouble for it?"
"Timothée Chalamet almost feels like The Doctor here. 

He could play Doctor Who.

Though would be cool if he played a prequel William Hartnell Doctor who"
How many times are we going to remake this movie
Cant wait❤❤
This actually looks good unlike the last one
I think this was the Vision he had in Dune that scared him shitless
I hope Johnson's chocolate shop is called consultio/consultius
I swear I thought for a second that Willy is played by Daniel Trasher.
This actually does look good.
I saw Mr. Bean 🥹❤️ and wow this trailer actually looks good!
ITS STRIKE. STRIKE THAT REVERSE ITA
Timoti Shalame is miscast.
I guess people are copying Wes Anderson movies now.
Без Деппа это не Вонка!!!
I wonder how woke this will be...
"Honestly, I was a bit suspicious about this movie when it was announced, but now, seeing the trailer, I'm 100% sure it's going to break the box office in the first week"
What a shame. This looks rather horrible.
The origin story I never knew I needed to know.
"Record amount of ""oh no'""s while watching a trailer for meeeee"
ngl the no daydreaming bit was very funny
"I just can see Timothée Chalamet acting like Timothée Chalamet, is like if his character of Willy Wonka had his same personality, sorry 😬"
"Timtothee is great and all this, but to me this is all about Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa"
How many we gonna get is Hollywood running ideas
"NEW
IDEAS
PLEEEEEASE!
Create new low-mid budget IP's, and bank off any successful ones for decades. Blumhouse certainly did!"
I already know this movie is going to bring me to tears
Loving it all except the token black side kick - why does every film now have a mixed race or black side kid now ?
Good god what a stacked cast. This had BETTER be good.
"OMG. Another rehash of a story that has been rehashed.

Hollywood has no creativity left. It is an empty shell."
"Idk Timothee seems like hes trying to act like gene wilder, like his delivery. Doesn’t seems like this role fits him"
"they should have made willy wonka black,🤣🤣"
I one asked for this. We didn't need it. And we certainly didn't ask for one dimension Chalamet to be miscast yet again. He was dire as Henry V in  The King and the weakest aspect of Dune.
I can't wait for Grandpa Joe: A Willy Wonka Story
omg rowan :0 best movie!!!
Willy woke....
Inspired casting. Chalamet looks like a young Gene Wilder
"The Chocolate Cartel 😅
Surpisely this looks good, and it's a  great idea for a back story."
With a good script this could be really enjoyable to watch! Trailer looks fine by me.
Till December?! Are you kidding meeee?!!
"Not gonna lie, this made me feel some kinda way"
❤❤❤
l never knew l needed Timothee as Willy Wonka in my life and he looks so handsome plus he looks so much like Regulus

"I'm the only one here not liking what I see, unfortunately. It feels like it's trying too hard. Hope I'm wrong"
"Okay, good to know this is a film that knows it is goofy and silly, but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun. Not to mention the cast looks incredible, and the director has never actually made a bad film, so I got a good feeling about this one."
"Sorry did not like this one.

Loved it."
Who up wonking they willy right now?
"Oh my god, the trailer is great, Timothée is just incredible as Willy Wonka. How I want to see the movie as soon as possible.🥰"
"I feel like we could’ve had someone better for this role, feels like he was just cast because he is quite popular right now"
"Guys seriously, are you making a willy wonka movie or the origins of honeydukes ?"
*Every good thing in this world started with a dream❤*
I’m something of a scient.. sorry magician 😂😂
"Can’t help but feel Timothee is tragically missed-cast. He’s not charming enough to rival Johnny Depp, and not weird enough to rival Gene Wilder…."
This looks like nightmare fuel
💝💝💝👍👌
y she black?
I can't believe he's white. I'm so offended that they made him white.
Please don't be a musical! I can't stand them!
"Wow hearing ""pure imagination"" being played in the background at one point made me really emotional 😢"
"The fact that Willy Wonka has a backstory and Timothee is the one playing Willy Wonka and the fact there’s also Rowan Atkinson,Hugh grant alongside the iconic actors tells me this is going to be a hilariously good movie"
Never liked Wonka but I think this one might change my mind
An absolute dream❤
"I'm not a huge fan of the trend of new movies in a series having just a shortened version of the original title, but at least it wasn't shortened to ""Willy"""
Looks boring.
ain't no way they be making willy wonka movie again
This actually looks good
#PutTimotheChalametDown!!!!
Seeing Rowan Atkinson is all i needed. im sold..
I love this so much. Will definitely be watching
I like timothee he did a good job but why not johnny depp
This does not need to exist and looks soulless.
who up wonking they willy rn
How do you know Hollywood has lost its creativity 20 years ago? They’ve done nothing but remakes
I thought it was naff until I saw Rowan Atkinson. Anything with him in is good
I’m getting some strong Gene Wilder vibes and no trace of Johnny Depp. Already off to a good start. Love JD but didn’t care for his version of Wonka.
Is it weird that Im happy about this
We definitely did not need this remake.
disappointed Kevin hart wasn't casted as the oompa loompa
"Timothée Chalamet is just amazing, wow"
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET AS WONKAAAAAAA
looks like a Disney Musical movie🍿
Mr Carsen is in this?!  Not very proper of him.
Somebody messed up the captionsssss
The TRAILER MUSIC IS SOO GOOOD
Yeah 2023 where everything must be politically correct. Bet this gonna flop
Letsgoooo Timothee
We did NOT need this! Why another one? And no more prequels.
Oh no. Steeling lines from the original. This looks like ChatGPT wrote it.
i've never seen timothee chalamet play anything but an angsty teenager so this is a bit unnerving lol
Finally hollywood is back on track
I like Timothee Chalemet but I don't like this trailer
Thank god he is not eating people but chocolates😂
Do we really need another Wonka movie? God this is cringe.
At beginning of the trailer I said why and by the end I said when
The original Oompa Loompa!!
This is going to be a fun movie . But sadly we all know there will be some YouTuber in their thumbnails spreading hate and saying how bad it’ll be 😂 or it’s demonic candy for children and all that BS you can’t enjoy films these days without some taking it to seriously either way ofcourse I’m gonna enjoy this movie regardless out of any hate it’ll randomly get or complaints . I’ve been seeing the word woke so much lately about this movie so fill me in on what’s woke about this ? I’d just like to know is it about the diversity?? Orrrr something else
Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa is the icing on the cake 👌
I smell an Oscar coming
Do you remember last time we got prequels of great movies? Not good was it
Yooo they got Karl from Mr. Beast to play Wonka
"Yay, another unnecessary reboot of a decades old franchise. How exciting."
Wait why does this actually look really good
Nothing will ever top the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory.
"As a kid. I equally loved and feared Wonka. There's a secret to him. Unknowable. Perhaps even a little dark. Is he lying? Is he magic? All of that is lost here. I see a noble effort, but Tim can't encapsulate Wonka."
PADDINGTON HIVE RISE UP 🎉🎉🎉
free willy wonka after he tapped some dark chocolate my nga
Mr bean is back
OMGG
I’m not a fan of his acting skills
Willy Woka.
"I still love Willy Wonka that act suspicious and awkward while trying to look friendly. This looks too wholesome, which is also ok since we'll see another version"
There is no such thing as white chocolate
This looks cute!
I ran out of good movies to watch. I so cannot wait for this anymore!
They’re not trying to remake what Johnny did. I’ll take it!
feels like cats somehow. would love to be proven wrong
I'll just wait for someone to just make a compilation of only oompa loompa scenes
I love Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompas but I wish we got a new design for them!
"Again, why!"
Is there any role he can’t do 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
You can put hugh grant in anything
Can't wait for this shiiiid
"Oh boy here we go ..all cliche , token inserts, dei,  and no heart or soul"
The voluptuous Rowan Atkinson!
"Урааа, мб даже в кинотеатрах пустят эту вашу „Жопку“."
cringe
Timothee Chalamet is WONKA!
Im very early to this 💯
bro this is alr movie of the year lol
Hugh Grant really went from Bridget Jones to Midget Jones 🙃
I'm hesitant.
You lazy company.
This looks promising!
Finally they made it without non sensical creepyness ❤
Why did they make a 3rd one for ?!
1 hour ago
I cant wait to see videos of Timothy's performances in _Wonka_ and _Dune Part 2_ side by side.
pass
Sorry but this guys version of wonka is terrible. He just looks like an overgrown 5 year old pretending to be willy wonka. Maybe thats the point of wonka? But it just takes away that feeling that gene brought. He felt like an adult playing a big kid but still had his adult seriousness... God this movie looks awful just saw the end with oompa loompa and yeaaaa not gonna bother to watch it.
"This Christmas, the chocolate must flow. 

That sounds weird, now that I think about it. 🤔"
Anything made by Warner Brothers you know it's a hot hit
Just glad they didn’t change wonkas race for the pc crowd
Put Atention Disney!
Great trailer
Who will play the menacing Grandpa Joe in this universe?
Is this the prequel?
WHY
This looks bad
Omg Hugh Grant at the end... nothing could've prepared me for that
Disgusting
Johnson’s always cooking up a new scheme
This looks stupid but if it’s made by the same director of paddington then it absolutely deserves a chance
Timothée Chalamet as willy wonka is something i didn‘t know i needed
"Hollywood being out of ideas, and trying to remake a story that never needs remaking, is not surprising, especially with Warner Bros. If this movie even does slightly well, I will be beyond shocked."
WILL HE WON'T HE OR WILLY OR WONNY. THAT'S THE QUESTION WE ARE ASKING!
Yo is that Daniel Thrasher 🤣🤣 (I know its not)
Johnny depp got screwed over by warner bros and I wont stop saying it.
"Rest in Peace Gene Wildermen, please let this movie do some justice"
Amazing!!!❤❤
im sorry but this is the best cast 🤩
There was no colored people in the original Willy Wonka except Oompa Lupas. So already not an accurate depiction.
THANK GOD ITS BASED OF THE ORIGINAL the remake is pure garbage so this really makes me happy since i think we needed some more lore to the universe
Is this the same story as willy wonka or its diferent or its a part 2 or not related
"When he said ""here we go momma"" I can't lie, I absolutely lost it and started crying like a baby, I lost my mother recently. Anyways, I'm beyond excited to see this movie!"
"Can't touch Gene Wilder, the guy was Wonka. I will say this, looks better then that disaster of a movie with Depp"
Who up wonkin they willy rn
After seeing the willy wonka cereal in the store i know this would be lit!
Just terrible!
Wrong casting from top to bottom
that's a good video and is this movie coming this year as the first live action wonka movie
My first grade self is screaming I remember watching the other two willy wonka movies and loving them
Why does this look like Harry Potter like it literally looks like fantastic beasts or something
I want johnny depp
Wow. They really ruined the Wonka franchise by casting this guy
Suprised no one has mentioned Mathew baynton the horrible histories guy.
Don't know what to say
"This is so silly.
 Like a children's story that delights all ages...like the original novel...PERFECT!"
what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what
I like Tim Burton's Loompaland better.
Man it's half way to 2024 and they're still making politically correct money grabbing spin offs.... This is gonna be a long ride down hill for Hollywood but hey it's their money
Is this movie gonna flop???
This looks fun.  Bright colorful.  Adds to the origins of Willy Wonka.
"I always thought that JD as willy wonka is irreplacable, hope this movie change my mind..."
"It's so weird but refreshing seeing Timothee in a role where he is happy and weird and not disaffected or  sulking.

Also, this was made by the director of Paddington? Now I have high hopes"
This is not what I was expecting.  Looks like it's going to be Amazing!!
Otro clavo al ataúd de Warner
The Oompa Loompa whistle at the end is legit. IYKYK
needs more peach and hammer
"The number of cookie cutter fake positive comments posted at almost exactly the same time can only indicate that studio interns have incorporated A.I in their inflating game,
Other than that,
way to ruin a classic WB."
I'm shocked by this - but I feel like Timothee Chalamet is miscast in this
ЭТО ПРЕКРАСНО
This looks like a real festive movie. We've not had one of those in years.
Again?!
did i see mathew baynton???
Love seeing key and peele as the cops 😅
It would be nice to have some original moviemaking….
"Trailers tend to be deceifful, so I have no faith on this movie until I can judge it on my own."
Great movie BUT something is missing..........
Haha...so many bots gushing fake love on this. This gonna bomb hard.
Not even close to johnny deep😔... A big flop
"Man, this is such a good year for movies. How will 2024 possibly top it? Then again, maybe I've never really been a movie buff before. But so many movies this year. So many hits. The upcoming awards season will be fire."
"Okay. I’m actually excited, you can feel the wonder and respect of the source material."
"Ok I’m impressed. I’m really enjoying reading Dahl’s stories to my son at bedtime lately, so this feels timely for me."
Shiver me timbers!
Yaadein taaza ho gai 🥹
This looks fun!
"I was on the fence with how very different this looks, then I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and I'm on board 100%."
Am I the only who feels like Chalamet is doing an imitation rather than feeling like he’s wonka himself…other than that looks great
I dont know you but I am here for mathew baynton
That is some unconvincing acting.
You can’t tell me Wonka didn’t go to Hogwarts! 😂
Is this a prequel to a Johnny Depp movie?
Johnny deep is best no one can replace him
Omggggg Hugh grantttt😂😂
Paul Atreides sure have some vivid dreams
Mr bean 😂
"I know its early to judge but…
All i could see is timothee chalamet , not willy wonka 😅"
Rowan Atkinson? This is a must watch.
I hope the other chocolatiers are over the top and unequivocal bad guys because it would be so damn funny. Everything else about this world is absurd they should just go for it
I really hate that adult characters all look like children now…. It sucks.
Jhonny depp from Alibaba express 🤡
my eyes teared up a little. this trailer is so wholesome. i need to watch this with my family
I heard this was supposed to be a dark spin on the story...apparently not 🤷‍♀️
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1111111111111
"This is the first time a trailer has ever got a stranglehold on my nostalgia! From the way the cameras moved to the dialogue.. it feels like the old “ Santa clause “ vibes where you just immediately feel overcome with joy watching it.

If this is just from the trailer I cannot wait for the actual movie!"
Looks terribly bad and cliched to death
0:42 thats brilliant
Who up wonking their willy right now?
❤❤
"Too woke ,they had to include a random black chick with unkempt hair"
Glad Hugh grant got out of Hollywood blacklist
totally invested
I love the Chocolate factory movies....this trailer didn't hit the vibe for me.
Жопка)
Ahhh it’s an absolute delight to see Paddington alumni in this movie!! Christmas is going to be magical~
Looks beyond terrible
"did i just gasp at the sight of rowan atkinson...nope i paused the video, played it back and made sure that it was him and gasped again"
U can't recast Johnny depp in any movie 😂😂
This looks Incredible
looks good. Lets hope there is some drama and tension here. Not just all sweetness and floss.
I'm not sure how I feel about Timothee Chalamet playing Willy Wonka but this movie looks fire so I'm excited
"Wow, Dune 2 took a weird turn..."
"Why is there a feminine man being the role of wonka ? Men are supposed to be masculine, will NOT watch this"
I am going to watch it i swear i am waiting for long time.
Jhonny Depp's Willy Wonka 😫😫😫😫
Let’s see how this does. My favorite movie is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory so let’s hope for something good.
Johnny depp ❤
i'd say Timothee Chalamet is hollywood's next big star......It's looking like he'll be having an illustrious career.
"I miss Johnny depp's Wonka .
My favourite childhood movie💝"
I miss Johnny!
"Even if it's minor role, it's always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films. Can't wait to see this one, the film captures the spirit of the source material so well ❤"
I'm getting whiplash bc the last movie I saw with Timothee Chalamet was Bones and all 😭
"Timothy seems like a miscast to me, he’s is a very serious actor, very good at brooding characters. Seeing him try to be goofy and happy-go-lucky doesn’t seem to fit to me. Still will be watching, movie looks very good."
Wasn't expecting a Willy Wonka origin story.  I wonder if Slugworth is in this movie.
Willy Wonka isn't mary poppins.....which is the vibe I'm getting from this.
I'm in!!!! So wholeheartedly in
i have a feeling this would be a new christmas movie classic!
"Remakes
Remakes everywhere!"
1:42 MR.BEAN?!?!?!?!
Garbage
hehe
This is жопка)
I got marry poppin vibes from this. Im sold
"As a fan of the original movie this doesn't look good... Not a fan of the main actor, he's not him. Not engaging and inspiring enough. The story plot sounds interesting at least."
It looks good but why does everyone know about the flying and such? Usually he is the most eccentric person in the area.
Se ve aburridaxd prefiero el wonka de depp
So is this a prequel?
Mr. Bean as the father never imagine that happening but need to happen
I’m actually impressed that they kept Wonka white because of all the unnecessary race and gender swapping Hollywood does
"Oh, no..."
Ok probably Hollywood is doing good stuff now
can’t wait! this seems nothing like the johnny depp willy wonka or the original.
More woke bollocks.
This looks terrible. lol
MR CARSON AND MR BEAN?? YESSS
"Love from India!!! Being a fan of Timothee', m really excited to see him in such a new n different role, he has adapted so well no doubt his acting skills r super, after Dune2 we ll get to see him being so funny n entertaining, the wait of coming months seems too long, have never heard story of Wonka or this character, but sure that Chalamet will surely make us fall in love with Wonka, Christmas come soon❤"
0:50 n-washing.
🍬🍫
"No Johnny Depp , No Wonka"
Plz don’t make this movie woke
Oh no it looks good 😔
I cannot wait to see this
Paul Atreides seems to have a side gig as a candy manufacturer. Is this accurate with the Duen lore?
Anyone else let out a shriek when they saw Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa?
Está película la espero con ansias el actor como Timothy nos da esa sensación de carisma como el antiguo Wonka de la primera película y un poco también de el Wonka de la película de Burton espero mucho está película 😁😁
"> Film set in the Victorian era

> somehow it's full of ""cultural enrichment""

> modern hollywood"
Im surprised that mr. Bean is in this
we just gonna make a new willy Wonka every 10 years now?
"My headcanon is that Paul Atreides saw this alternate timeline in a spice induced fever dream, and indulges in it as a kind of momentary escapism from his crushing burdens."
Looks whack NGL.
I still don't see TC being charismatic enough to play WW but I'm still going to watch it.
Chalamet as Wonka seems... Off. He just doesn't have that mad genius vibe that the character so desperately need.
Wowww this will be the best Christmas gift from Timothee 🥰🥰 egarly waiting.
They should picture Wonka as an African-Asian guy with blue eyes
"Timothee as wonka is something I never knew I needed, but I most definitely did."
Loosely based on MrBeast Feastables 😂
"Looks good, I might watch it. (note: I did not like JonnyDepp/DeepRoy's version....)"
The last 5 seconds alone make me want to see this movie!
Literally nobody asked for this
"Hugh Grant.
Playing the Oompah Loompahs…
That man has truly reached the peak of his career."
All of this
Rowan Atkinson and Timothee Chalamet! Wow such a great combination 😊
"Im a simple man. As soon I saw chocolate defying the laws of physics, I booked my seat."
"That's not Wonka, that's Timmothy Chalmette"
This looks horrible. #HardPass
"I have always visualised Willy Wonka as someone crazier which I don't see here. But well, I am open to see what coming up."
"I thought I saw Timothee chalemat and immediately decided to watch it, at first I wasn't sure if it was him, but it was timothee and I am here for it"
Does it look a bit Potterish tho?
So a prequel for the prequel of Snowpiercer.
Finally a Snowpiercer origin story.
Snowpiercer prequel finally.
Жопка
Joke's on us this is the sequel after Dune 2 showing us how Paul is as Emporer
"Noway !!! Not Timothée Chalamet, Johnny Depp is really going to be bummed ..."
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of my favorite movie🧡, Really excited for this one. Giving me fantastic beasts vibes."
Man Timothee is this generations leo dicaprio.
I would love to see a 2023 version of the chocolate factory
It’s a shame Gene Wilder couldn’t live to see this.
"In business, Jeremy, you learn that every man has his price. And I judge yours to be... fivehundredandthirtypounds."
Not Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa! lmao
"its simple, i see timothee i click."
Looks good.
Gene Wilder is rolling over in his grave. SMDH.
They could’ve cast someone else but go off
So is there a point of the little girl being there or is it a diversity inclusion???
"Estoy emocionado, se ve increíble, no puedo esperar a verlo!! Estuve mucho tiempo esperando a ver algo nuevo sobre Willy Wonka 🤩🙏"
is it so hard to make something like... original?
Oh dear
"This is gonna bomb. This was never gonna be my cup of tea, but everything I’d seen leading up to this trailer looked like it could be promising for the studio. But now? It looks like a blended mess of ideas with no clue which it wants to follow most."
It's wonkin' time!
what an excellent cast!! omgggg! CINEMAAAAAA
What a miscast.
I'm waiting!!!
"""just be glad you're you"" 🍫"
Looks so good!
"I like everything about it except Timothy as Willy Wonka. Not that I don't like him, he's a good actor, but miscast here. Ironically, Rowan Atkinson would have been the perfect Willy Wonka 20 years ago."
Sally Hawkins! YES!
This looks good
"I can't wait... NOW, Christmas will be SPECIAL!!!"
"This having the 60's and the 2005 movies' aesthetics combined, feels like a must-watch"
This looks magical!
CGI look awful 😭
Zendaya looks a bit darker in this.
Who on earth was timothee cast instead of Jeremy Allen white?
Oh man that's good @2:19
I want it to be released today🤧
"""From writer/director of the Paddington films""

Say no more. 👍"
"""Everything good in this world started with a dream. So you hold on to yours."" So beautiful. This movie will be magical 💖"
"I know a lot of people hate Timothee, but this doesn't look too bad"
meh depp was way better
Can film makers think of a movie that’s not a prequel or reboot? I wish this generation would think of something new and quit remaking everything.
Might not good as johnny depp but its interesting
WOKEA
I LOVE THIS but why do the Oompa Loompa's look like that
yes yes yeeeesss
Este chico solo actúa y arruina todas las películas igual que holland
"Rowan Atkinson is here too, I'm sure it's gonna be amazing 😍"
THEY FIXED THE OOMPA LOOMPAS! Thank goodness gracious!
I knew that was Paterson Joseph ... and Olivia Colman! *THAT'S NUMBER WANG!*
"good luck Timothee, wonka its a hard role. ill be rooting for u"
Help why did they cast thimothee chalamee for willy wonka #terriblecasting 😭
Willy wonka is the Batman of candy 😂
Awesome Wonka Official Trailer.
This is nothing like the original Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory . I really hope it is good cause i adored Willy Wonka & The Chocolate Factory. I have such fond memories of watching that movie when i was a kind in the 70's.
NOT Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompan
So excited 🍫
This Wonka doesn't look at batcrap nuts as the other 2 before him. Don't like it.
🤩🤩🤩
Alan johnson and Sophie from Peep Show. This is incredible!
Looks good
"flat jokes, lack of inherent eccentricity that Wilder and Depp had, mediocre hollywood storytellng. It has all the makings of a forgettable re-telling. How about writers come up of some new ideas instead of re-doing the same thing? Lazy."
omggg... Rowan! is in the movieeeeeeee!!
"Well, as a wise person once said; ""It must be belived to be seen"""
A perfect casting would have been Jeremy Allen White. I’m still going to watch this it give me A Series of Unfortunate Events vibes
Usual woke bollocks
first movie im watching timothy chamomile not make a pouty bedroom face every 3 seconds lol
"Honestly, Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory was such an amazing movie that made my childhood, those adventure scenes inside the factory, still gives me chills. The values that a fictional character like Willy Wonka has, is something that's commendable.!!! Would definitely watch this masterpiece in theatres!!! ❤️❤️"
One day there will be an original idea
Looking forward to the part where he rides the chocolate worm to prove the Oompa Loompas he's their savior and recruit them to fight the Chocolate Cartel and become Emperor Willy Wonka I of house Wonka.
all those blacks in victorian england lmao.  no thanks.
Wow I might actually leave my house to see this
No. Thumbs down. Hard pass.
Even tho this trailer looks absolutely banging. Nobody will ever beat johnny depp
Excited 😆 can’t wait ahhhh 🎉❤
"this looks so deranged, i can’t wait"
Best diabetic fantasy ever.
"Well, Oompa loompas are in the movie.. i ll watch it"
Took it long enough
I can't wait to never watch it (though I believe it wll be a decent family christmas movie)
Why are people constantly coining off original characters...🤦‍♀️ Now we have to make prequels to everything even the lion king is doing a prequel now too.
Um ok
SALLY HAWKINS!!!
Willy Woke-a
Will he bonk ya in the chocolate factory?
"Dude, this looks bad! 😂"
"Ok, I was skeptical but you convinced me.  Can’t wait to see it."
BEAN
The Americanisation of British Literature is very Annoying. Why do they all have american accents?
It’s perfect! ❤
Johnny Deep where???? Atleast a cameo???
World Still need Jhony Dep as a wonka ❤  ➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️➡️ Correct me ❤
What? Never imagined this to be a thing!
Why ruin Wonka with Timotheè? Timotheeè is over saturated because he’s popular on social media.
I was just thinking about wanting another Willy wonka movie 😭
"где комментарии с жопками, срочно поднимайте их вверх)"
I think that if you were raised by Gene Wilder it has been years since all of this stopped making sense.
1:02 mr bean cameo
Are you kidding me with this garbage?
Hyped
Looks like Woke Wonka.  I'll pass.
Wonka 🎉
So this is a prequal to the 70 Wonka because the outfit the ommpaloompa and the flute
Timothee will one day play joker in a batman movie no doubt about it
Only one Wonka
Defying Gravity. I can hear the song.
"Ah yes. The origin story of of a candy factory owner who turns a factory tour into a dangerous game where only the generous survive, the impure and disfigured according to their sins, and a cult of tiny orange monsters dispose of the bodies. Who wouldn't want to see that!?"
This sounds a lot like my entrepreneurial journey 😂
OMG Chalamet😱😳😮he’s suit fot this character 😍
This is so good 💯
No way this is amazing - Timothée Chalamet makes a great young willy wonka
Does Hollywood have any original ideas at all?
we love to recycle and ruin successful intellectual properties to serve the gaping maw of profit extraction don't we folks
"You know, because I love Willy Wonka I want to look forward to this. But so far it looks dumb"
Why does Willy Wonka have to be American? 😂 I don't think he was ever American
"Hugely unpopular opinion. Chalamet is hot, but not very talented."
WAS THAT THE ORIGINAL MOM? FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE
So cuuuute! I love the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. I appreciate the origin story
Honestly wish theu chose a different actor
Can we at least agree that casting Jeremy Allen White over Timothee Chalamet would've been a cool homage to Gene Wilder?
timmy's so versatile when it comes to his roles!

"I'm convinced he's a wizard. it so would fit. lol
swear he was floating twice in this trailer.  XD"
This looks fun.
"🎶there is no life I know to compare with pure imagination living there, you'll be free if you truly wish to be🎶🍫🍫🍫🍫."
"I know that a lot of people were calling for a black woman to play Wonka and were irate about Timothee possibly getting the role, but this looks wonderful. A great Christmas movie about candy and it's set in winter. It's going to be wonderful."
I saw Mr bean 😅😂
Bro this looks way better than I thought! Now I’m excited to see this!
Next movie franchise in the making
"this, again..."
Missing Johny Depp
it’s time to stop
Oh I really hope this is good. These prequels scare me sometimes but this looks so cute!!
This trailer shocked Me lets hope the movie is better than the trailer
the TB disaster is forgiven WB does it  again
idk it’s not giving willy or wonka
*I can only imagine Johnny Depp As Willy Wonka* ❤
Hugh Grant what are you doing here loca
"Paul Muad-Dib, Lord of House Atreides is also WONKA ?!?"
johnny depp
"They could make a new Wonka every so often and not ever make the same movie twice.  No complaints here.
There's a lot more content in the book left to mine... "
It’s Alan Johnson from Peep Show! 1:08
🤨
This will BOMB.
"I was curious if we would see Oompa Loompas, I was not disappointed."
"For one more time, Timothée Chalamet proves that he is the most promising and talented actor of his generation ✨ 💫"
Ok watching this now in theatres
"Director of Paddington and the producer of Harry Potter, seeing and recognising the actors that are in this and that it’s a prequel to a the chocolate factory which was a favourite, when I read it in school. Pretty hype for this movie. 🍫"
Man. Timothy is really putting a lot of effort into selling the lunacy. Very effortful.
Hello dune😅😅
"Oh dear….now Willy Wonka has been Wokified.
I’ll be sticking to the previous 2 versions. Good job I have them on DVD. I won’t be watching this."
"Looks fun, and I swear this looks like it stars @danielthrasher. I'd watch THAT for sure!"
Why is this twink fricking everywhere?!?!
No jhonny Depp should do it
Bro can't act. We missed out on having Ryan Gosling. SMH.
I feel my the sugar increase in my blood …. And the rise of my diabetes
Does anyone recognize some of the places we saw in HP & FB
"they gave Willy Wonka a heart, a story, where it all started! yeah!"
Timmy I'm so excited for this movie ❤
guys tims gone silly
"Stupid unoriginal and boring😖Pedo-wood is dead, and rightfully deserved."
WHY??? Just leave it alone and come up with new film ideas instead of killing classics time and time again!!! 😢
Jhonny Deep as WILLY WONKA holds my heart ❤️.....from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory ❤❤
"It should've been Jeremy Allen White, but I do love me some Timmy Cham Cham."
gaaaas se re maluca
"It looks really good, but is Hollywood done with making fun/bright movies? Even all the Disney live action movies have this dark look and so emotional. Let's bring fun back."
"""From the Director of Paddington"" CONSIDER ME SOLD"
No thank you but I appreciate the intention
Timothee seems like such… bad casting?
No one can replace Johnny Depp
Is it woke?
ЖОПКА
I like that they made it extremely different from Johnny depp’s version. This looks more like a Harry Potter movie.
Woka
I am very exited to see timothy chalamet as legendary billy wonka😍😍🥰
"Watching this biting into a Cadbury Silk Ganache , I can feel the magic .....I mean this flavor this is what Willy Wonka was about..they nailed it."
"Black cops from that time, hahaha, nothing forced"
The concept of Wonka starting out and taking on the Chocolate Conglomerate only leads to a tragic tale where Wonka himself actually becomes the conglomerate. The rebel against the establishment becomes the establishment. Whimsy to tragedy in 2 hours.
December 15? 😓
Mr. Bean!!!
I hope they bring back the original Oompa Loompa song!!!!!
"This litteraly the most soulless, largest excuse for a cash grab ever. Same kinda characters, antagonists, and plot points as every other kids movie and sequel that’s been pumped out since like 2019."
"I like the part when he said ""ITS WONKIN TIME"" literal chills"
this is going to be fantastic i know timothee has done excellent job and we get rowan atkinson too!!! this is definitely a  must watch.
not lily rose depp's ex playing the same iconic character her father is famous for playing
I’m just glad it’s a new story and Tim Burton has nothing to do with it.I’m in.
"Timothee Chalamet has the emotional range of a teaspoon. 

Dude looks like a wet flannel the whole trailer. 

He’s easily the worst thing about this movie and that’s such a shame."
"""YOU LOSE GOOD DAY SIR!!!!!!!!!!"""
Love seeing song artists try cinema. Looks like a fun movie lil mabu!
Someone tell @danielthrasher that Tim Chalamet stole his whole look for this film.
I was having somewhat of a bad week so seeing this made me lift up a bit.
I refuse to accept this. Gene will always be Willy.
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD IM READY
This looks like a good movie that I’ll never watch
"I'm screaming, crying, throwing up, punch me in the face!!!! Ahhhh. Give it to me now."
I will be murdered for this but the story seems very interesting I am just not sold on the casting choice for Wonka yet.
RELEASE GODZILLA X KONG TRAILER PLEASE 😢
Not sure how to feel. I think it needs to be brighter and more colorful but maybe it will be later on with the factor parts to contrast the rest of the world.
Hm definitely has a big “Harry Potter” vibe to it.
omggg
That Willy Wonka is making me feel things
This looks more promising than the 2000 version of Willy Wonka. I mean Charlie and the chocolate factory! Now this one might make you wanna get some chocolate bar before you enter the theater
This looks so bad
If only Timothy Chalamet decided to act for this one.
The main character from the bear would've better.
"I did not blink once during this trailer, that proves that this movie is pure imagination"
Roman Atkinson for the role of old man Wonka!
Looks a lot better than Disney's live-action remakes
Did we need another origin story
How many black characters can you shoehorn into a Willy Wonka origin story? This is just getting sad now Hollywood. 😂
No.
Can't help but this actor looks and acts like @danielthrasher
The African Version of Willy Wonka?...You could not pay me to go see this Woke Crp.
anyone notiсe about willy жопка?
"Why did they make another Willy Wonka movie for? Hollywood writers really are completely out of original ideas for stories to make movies about that is why they just keep rehashing and remaking old movies. 
Sorry I probably won't be watching this one."
Mr Bean?!
What?!! They can't make Charlie & The Great Glass Elevator movie?!!
oof.
I wonder what horrifying end the little girl will meet...
"This looks absolutely delightful, can't wait"
Say it with me now. Timothee Chalamet
"Oh, my God! It's going to be a fantastic movie."
… no. God please… NO
Is it just me thinking Timothy looks like Tom Holland and they both can play Wonka. 😅 I'm sure not all of you is impressed by Tom's acting but I love both of them.
HORRIBLE HISTORY GUY.
"Yo, this kid is giving me Gene Wilder vibes. I’m loving it, give me my presale tickets NOW."
😕
This actually looks like a good prequel.
Wohoooooo❤❤❤❤❤
Wtffff
"El crítico : Mediocre y Cliché...

Josh : Shhh!! , No cuestiones, Solo gozalo~🍭"
oof
Please make this a game!!!❤
Mat Baynton. Yes.
Lmao he looks adorable as Willy Wonka. He actually suits the character really well . Can't wait for the movie to come
my childhood movie
no
Do anybody roald  dahl
This actually looks pretty good
Ah yes The Nepo Baby strikes again. Nice
Do anybody roald  dahl
I always thought the magical things were secret and kept within the factory! I'm not quite sure yet what to think of this but it has spirit and looks whimsical so it'll definitely make an entertaining Christmas movie. Will probably watch!
He has to take his acting to whole another level. He has to respect and be at par with what Johnny Depp did! And Johnny set the bar a little too high!
"I mean, of course Charlie And The Chocolate Factory needed a prequel to fill in Willy Wonka's backstory. Of course it did. Why wouldn't it?"
"I love both Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, as well as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. So I can’t wait to see this!"
1:41 Rowan Atkinson
How many times will Hollywood enter this cheat code?
Omg❤ timmy
I still don’t know how I feel about Timothee chalamet playing Willy wonka
"Okay. So I haven’t seen it yet and I give it a 10 out of 10. This trailer was more entertaining than the Previous Movie made…. Not the original. In fact, if I had one complaint is that they showed too much. I feel like I saw the movie already."
"This looks like absolute, utter garbage."
Who is the forced silly companion……can’t beat Gene Wilder…
I seen a oompa loompa I'm sold 💀💀💀
"I feel like if Gene Wilder was alive today, he would be happy to see this film!"
Looks magical ✨  can't wait! 🤩
Eh...I'm not digging his take on Wonka. Usually he plays characters that are very different from his actual personality and this just looks like Timothee Chalamet playing himself and doing a satirical impression of Wonka lol. But I'm open to see how it turns out.
I want to see this film
"Producer Guy: So, you have a completely new, original movie for me?
Screenwriter Guy: What? But.. no... we never...
Producer Guy: Just kidding, we'd never take a risk like that. So, what nostalgic property are we milking today?"
This actually looks amazing! I’d lowkey love to see this in theaters!
"Feel like this is an all sizzle and no steak kind of vibe. 
He seems too level headed to be willy wonka, I kind of feels it's a character we should never fully understand/believe like Gene. Give me mr.bean as wonka anyday"
"I mean, I love Timothee Chalamet, but he is just not doing it for me as Willy Wonka..."
AAAA CAN’T WAITTTT FILM KESUKAAN AKUUUU SEPANJANG MASAAAAA
i love how this is a prequel to the iconic gene wilder willy wonka and not the more recent one. wilder was always my favorite wonka and i look forward to seeing timothee's spin on the role
"Let me guess, at the end or the credits we will see a kid named Charlie."
"Was not expecting The Greatest Showman starring Willy Wonka, but I'm here for it all the same. 😂"
Bloody sweet !!
meh...
Please don’t go woke.
I'm not going to get my hopes up
Wow...gonna watch this movie with my family
I'm going to use the word chocolate carell in my daily vocabulary
Oompa Loompa about to do the Ice Spice dance.
"Woah wait, rewind to see 
Rowan Atkinson"
Timmy you are outstanding!!!
Hm. Looks and sounds a bit like a Burton/Elfman imitation...
this is gonna eat so hard
"This movie had better have that same tone the original had where it seems fine as a kid but as you get older, you realise how messed up it was. Otherwise it just wouldn't be fun."
"WOW I've never seen more commenters with ""This channel doesn't have any content""  in one place!

It's almost like they aren't real people!"
Great. Another Willy Wonka movie
willy Wonka finna sell peach flavored chocolate
Do we have absolutely no original ideas left in hollywood? Does anybody have any creativity down there or is ripping off a movie and a book together the best y’all can do? The wasted potential to create a new franchise here is painfully obvious.
"Willy Wonka and Johnny Depp are much better, and the black girl was put there only because of tolerance"
This looks fantastic and magical!
"I hate to be closed minded, but Gene Wilder set the bar so high as WW that it seems hard to appreciate the character done by anyone else"
Diversity is always the main point of movies these days. Not good storytelling. That’s why they’re flopping. This seems the same
I miss johny depp
"ну и дерьмооо, лайки поди ещё накрутили"
I am so excited for this film! looks fantastical!
God I fkn hate this kid
"So far freaking awesome, He is a bit shorter then usual but maybe their will be others that will be little people sized like the original"
Man can make people fly but uses it to sell chocolate.
"""He's good.""

""TOO good.""

Every other young male actor in Hollywood right now watching Timothee Chalamet."
💯❤️...
lol did they used the luxury mall in Milan for Wonka's shop? 🤣 All these movies look identical. Overproduced tacky kids movies (without actually specifically being for kids)
"Yeah before he colonized oompa loompa land and enslaves the oompa loompas, like the highlight of peoples career back then was to work a factory one day like it was a dream job and Charlie bucket can't wait! This should've been a dark comedy at best where wonka devises ways to market his factory as the highest standard of regulations but in reality people go missing, original workers like grandpa Joe where kicked out of the job because of the newly arrived oompa loompas, have some corporate espionage going on to, something besides a happy go lucky wonka"
OK this convinced me. it's gonna be a great Christmas movie
Is this movie connected with Johnny Depp's Charlie and Chocolate Factory movie?
Another one? Jeeze.
This trailer just confirmed my initial opinion that this is an absolutely unecessary prequel not a single person asked for. This just doesn't seem to fit into the original Wonka timeline or even the Burton one for that matter.
Yay
Really ran out of ideas
Жопка
Yo
Finally not a whole movie !!!
Johnson?
Why is wonka not black? Why isn’t everyone black? 😂😂😂
"I THINK Timothée is trying to pull off a manic Doctor Who-like vibe with his Wonka but it just doesn't work for me, something in his eyes and delivery isn't selling me on it"
Yikes 👎
is mr been in this movie 🤡🤡🤡
willy woke'a and the cultist factory
No.
Everyone wait hold on is that from mr bean? 1:41
Could they have picked a less charismatic person to play Wonka?
"OK.. OK.. giggled a lil.. teared up a bit(mama) has some veteran comedy actors, young new talent, plus an shining star. Think the recipe is right.. ITS WONKA (80's/90's childhood memories of watching it almost once every week or every two weeks both at home(TBS/TNT) every summer plus as the movie choice at the community center summer camps). Hope the story is good!!"
we love the ORIGINALITY of Hollywood
He’s no Gene Wilder.
Gene Wilder would be proud
"love Chalamet but of all people, him as wonka ?!"
gene wilder wouldve probably hated it but itll still be good probably
Omg this looks so good! I was very pessimistic when I heard this was being made but it looks amazing.
"you brand loyalists eat anything tf up! apparently all it takes is sticking a famous logo in your face, disney+ grade cgi, and a popular actor in a role that should probably be played by a younger person and or a child for the average adult movie goer to throw all their money at it. wtf happened to REAL MOVIES."
I’m so excited!!!!
"Wow, this looks weird. I see they're attempting to make a prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, meaning this is going to be barely based on the Roald Dahl books.

Really would've been better making a movie following up the Tim Burton adaptation, which was much more faithful to the books."
POV: your here before it mega viral
Why is there black people in this movie?
"I Was Here! 818,009 views"
Nobody wanted this nobody i mean nobody can replace #Johhnydepp
Just when I think I love Johnny depp as Willy wonka y’all come out w these epic ness !
Oh this is bad bad.

We already have Mr. Beast
BROOOOO YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
CAN'T WAIT!!!!!!!!
This seems kinda fun
Dude straight up looking like Billy The Kid
Ohhh happy  to see
I can see how this was produced by the producer of Harry Potter — the train scene and the wide shots look magical
Nobody talking about mr bean 😂
The film of the holiday season
"Aah goosebumps. Willie wonka is back ! But alas, i didn't like the lead role play by him. I don't think he fits that insane and funny role"
Johnson?
“Great Engenuiyi”💀
i get a young jim carey vibe off this actor
Johnny Depp is the most perfect willy wonka for me. His role in charlie and the chocolate factory is very entertaining. Let's see if Chalamet does justice to this role.
"I love the original Willy wonka and I like Timothy Chalamet. That being said there’s seriously something lacking in this film I can tell. I don’t know how to describe it but it’s little things….Timothy with an American accent makes this less believable. Him having a black female sidekick is clearly a box to check for the academy to give it votes. The actors look like they are trying too hard. 

Willy wonka was a step above character because of how relaxed he was in all situations showing a sense of “I have this under control” no matter how dire the situation may be which left us calm relaxed and light hearted in the face of a serious situation such a losing kids on a tour.

He was the main character but you couldn’t tell if he was an antagonist or a protagonist. Charlie and his grandpa were the protagonists and I think that gave gene wilder more freedom to be relaxed as a character. And that means something to the attraction of a film. 

I watched Tim burtons version for about a half hour before I shut it down. I like burton films too and this seemed good but depps depiction was almost too relaxed with not enough humor. It’s hard to live up to wilders performance but it is what it is.

An actor like Tom hardy could pull this role off because it’s so out of his norm of character to play which makes it interesting. I think that’s what it would take.

This all comes from only seeing one trailer…I hope my analysis is proven wrong."
Whoa Dune 2 is way different than I expected!
I went into the trailer thinking this is gonna be a mess. But honestly there's a level of whimsy to it that really sold me. Also Chalamet's giving off lots a Gene Wilder energy and that's always a good sign.
RIP hollywood
After Barbie this is ❤😊
I am sorry but wonka felt little off for me maybe because of what Johnny Depp showed me and how i imagine wonka to be
I love this movie love india
Feels like Candy Crush
Releasing on my birthday!!! I love you Timothy Chalamet!
Why does it actually look great

"90% green screen, script written by AI, humor for a room temp IQ. The original is a timeless classic that still holds up today. I don’t even want to finish this trailer. I’ll pass."
А че так неLров много?
wonk
Boring
"Ok I wasn't that excited for this movie when we first heard about it, but now I really wanna see it lol"
I can’t believe Timothy is acting this crazyyy but I love it
The remake NO ONE asked for. No thanks
Looks like a movie that'll show TC can't be a lead in everything lol
bean
This looks awful
"MORE CG, LETS GOOOOOO"
So are they basing this off the 70s movie rather than the original book?
Rowan Atkinson is way over hyped….
Mr Beast - The Biopic
"Dune 2 looks quite different from the first. 
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe."
Snoop Dogg should start his own chocolate brand.
We are getting this instead of paddington 3. This better be worth it
i don't know if timothee chalamet's got that underlying insanity to him that gene wilder and johnny depp created
Stop. Just stop.
Johnny Depp is the best character ever who present Willy Wonka
@MrBeast !!!
Omggg !!!!
sry but no one can beat johnny depps wonka
"Wow, Willy Wonka is back again, but now showing us his past in more detail and how he made his chocolate factory, that will be impressive, you want to see it"
"It's awesome,it amazing,it perfect."
OMG i am SO excited for this film!!!! 😁😁😁😁🍫🍫🍫🍫
"The animation is not at all upto the mark.
Disappointed 😞"
Always assumed Wonka was an eccentric madman because of years of absurd wealth and isolation. Turns out he started exactly like that and the whole chocolate baron thing had little effect on his personality.
Im sorry but NO!! If youve seen the performance that Gene Wilder put on in the original film anything else is just not going to be good enough. And didnt we already see a horrible remake of this with Johnny Depp??! STOP REMAKING CLASSICS!!!
I will be watching
Can’t wait til some original content comes out and not this worn cloths that gets throw in the washer with different stains…. You guys are more brain fried than a chicken glazed in explosive oil.
This looks… so good…
Timothy is channeling Abed from Community.
Nice to see a white actor playing a classic white character. Thank God Disney didn't touch this one
I love some of these actors but omg this movie looks absolutely terrible!
"Dune, Call Me by Your Name, Beutiful Boy, Wonka, The King, Bones and All, Little Women. His range is absolutely wild. If he can pull this off… just damb. He is like a chameleon except he does not need to lose and gain weight like Christian Bale. He is the next DiCaprio."
So disappointed.  Why isn't Willy Wonka an ethnic minority. Such a lost opportunity 😢
"No one saying it so I will... Matt Baynton!!!!! Long live the six idiots. I'm so sick of prequels and origin stories, but for his sake, I hope it's a good movie😆"
"maybe its just me but willy wonka is suppose to be weird, mysterious and kinda intimidating. i'm sure this will be a fun movie but it doesnt seem like timothy has captured the vibe of willy wonka"
"Ooof i like Timothy but this character is absolutely iconic and I'm just not sure he can fill the boots of Gene Wilder (nobody really can).  I'll be seeing Dune 2, but probably skipping this one sorry Timothy :/"
Ok this actually looks really good 🔥🔥
"Meh, pass. I hate musicals"
They did the original Oompa Loompa look ☺️ this looks so good
"Booooo this ridiculous remake. Gene Wilder is, and will forever be, the one and only Wonka."
Hollywood is sure out of original ideas. This looks absolutely boring.
"When I heard the ""Pure Imagination"" in the background music!!!! 😆😆😆"
Does anyone have an original idea anymore?
Willy Wokea. 🤢
"""You're a Wizzard, Wonka"""
🗑
No thanks
Looks forcefully woke
Omg Charlie and the chocolate factory
Was that mr bean?
There is no version in the world like Johnny Depp
Looks Willy Willy Baaaad
Miss Johnny depp ❤
Formulaic: the Formula: the Movie.
"Wow their making Wonka again, after Johnny Depp remake, first Gene Wilder, Johnny Depp and now .. 🎉❤"
"Timothée Chalamet is really taking his superb skills to the beyond by starring in everybody's fav iconic chocolate maker

Great to see Rowan Atkinson return as that nostalgic zany and beany priest from that hilarious wedding's episode 

A surprise to be sure but a welcome one as Hugh Grant dances to that familiar memorable 1971 melody"
😃I definitely want to see this movie
Wonka looks too young. I am not a fan. 😢
Dune part 2 looking very spice induced
Why does he sound like Tom Holland
"There's no earthly way of knowing 
Which direction we are going"
"That was the one thing I found weird about the other two films: he had candy with unique abilities, but none were ever made public."
"Wow, a lot of many iconic British actors in this!"
Really……..a musical
"I'm confused if this takes place in England or America. 🤔 I dunno. I'm bored with prequels, sequels, and remakes. But I suppose this might turn out to be one of the better ones."
Can't wait! 😄
Now I want chocolate
bruh how many versions r they gna make of this movie…. leave it alone!
"God loves you and takes care of you so that this message reaches you. God is the one who created this great universe and has complete control over it. And the greatest loss that a person loses in this life is that he lives while he does not know God who created him, knowing the Messenger of Muhammad, the last of the messengers, and the Islamic religion, the last of the heavenly religions.  The great intelligence, before you believe in something or not, is to read it, study it, and understand it well, and then you have the choice to believe in it or not. I advise you on this now before you do not have time to do that."
I'm so glad it's referencing the original movie ❤
They really did run out of new movie ideas huah
Bro when I saw Mr. bean my jaw dropped
Its giving me Jingle Jangle vibes.
Didn't know Willie liked dark chocolate.
Never been interested in a movie about Willy Wonka. It seems this is the first one I am going to watch.
Hugh!
meh
"""A Know Chocolate"" issued by Sydney Corporations Pte Ltd (Pnimles Lyc-tender) Paper Labels of Chocolates was finally issued by Willy-Wonka Factory in 1993th yr- because of chocolate wax contaminations, ..."
This origin story looks better than having a dentist father who hates sweets
See this is why I stopped watching movies 😂 just prequels and sequels
"First of all, Tim Burton already gave us Willy Wonka's origin story. More importantly, Wonka doesn't need an origin - he just exists. The appeal of the character is that he's a mystery, and what little we do learn about his past (in both the novel and the 1971 film) more than suffices: your imagination fills in the gaps. The character works because he's mysterious, and because we can never be sure if he's telling the truth or not."
Everything looks amazing but im gonna need some serious convincing that that’s Wonka.. Where’s all his goof gone?
A small black girl companion? At that time period? In that social status? Localized entirely in that geographical region?
"I'm sorry to say but Timothee Chalamet isn't cut out for this role, he is as vanilla as possible. The craziness which is needed can't be faked by acting, it needs to be your original personality."
❤️❤❤🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This actually looks pretty good.
This looks TERRIBLE.   The actor portraying Wonka looks like he’s trying to do Johnny Depp; not Gene Wilder.  How pathetic.
big meh
This is gonna be an EPIC FAIL!
Creatively bankrupt
litttttttttttt !
I'm gonna say it. He's hot... But I really do not like his acting.... Like in anything.
I was not expecting the trailer being this good.
"Sorry but from what i just Saw….. i am not feeling it. He sounds like Normal Timothee, it doesn’t feel like he is playing a different person."
"Too many blacks in this, wtf"
i was sold on this within the first 15 seconds.
i’ve never been more excited for christmas
"This looks 🔥 haven’t been this impressed with a trailer fora while,  definitely tuning into this for sure"
Omg too freaking good! I loved it
WHAT....why Timothee😭😭😭
……Fine! I’ll give this one a shot. I could use a feel good movie.
So is this is before he becomes Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder?
"Great, this film isn't a new version of the Charly and the chocolate factory."
Wow this looks… really bad
Amazing 😍😍🤩🤩
A prequel looking to combine both the 1971 and 2005 universes
"1:02 Now this is the part, I am most excited about"
i'm ready for christmas
Boi I'm watching it😊
Just here for Rich Fulcher
"-- Great idea, tell - how Wonka came to be!"
I have been a huge fan of both CATCF movies since i was a kid this makes me really happy
I’m so surprise it’s between Gene Widler to Johnny Depp but now Timothee Chalamet will be Wonka. It’s incredible. I’m so excited to see it.
Not another remake of this...can't we come up with new ideas instead of redoing the same stuff over and over?
Our bean is back 😍
why i will not watch this movie 0:25
Omfg Timothee is sooo cute ❤
Another wonka film?
"I just can't do it. There is only one Wonka, and his name is/was Gene Wilder. RIP"
too many black people in this. sick of it.
Looks horrid
such absolute bliss having Chalamet as Willy Wonka
This actually looks quite promising? Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa caught me off guard but it's kind of perfect?
Mr. Bean is in there. Might actually be pretty good then.
i have to be honest this looks super boring and I'm rly disappointed but i will watch it before i decide
I just did not see Rowan Atkinson.... Fck
Looks good!!! Even better knowing that Rowan Atkinson is in it.
Wait is that mr.bean in the elevator?? 1:02
Cant beat johnny depps willy wonka film
Charlie in the chocolate factory
I’m actually excited for this movie and hope that it does good
"Hey Mat Baynton is in this!  Gonna watch just for him, even if it’s a small role"
A movie that I did not think we needed and .... still don't think we need
"I'm something of a magician, inventor & chocolate maker!"
Hey look! ((Hollywood)) is mocking the Church!  I am sooooo surprised.
"Trop nul, c’est beaucoup trop Disney"

"Timothée, Hugh, Rowan. Let's go! 😂"
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW ROWAN ANKISTON.ITS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE
"Why do they need to fill every English story with "" diversity"""
"Yesterday, I thought this movie trailer will come out next month or two. Apparently I was wrong😂"
Hugh Grant as an Oopma Loompa is E V E R Y T H I N G.  And in close second is Rowan Atkinson running away from a giraffe.  Looking forward to the big screen experience for this one!
"This looks great, a blending of Wonka, and I never thought of how good a prequel could be"
Il stick with the original
I’ve never been a Timothée Chalamet fan. But this might be the thing that converts me.
"Ah..!! the movie about Mr. Wonka, the pedophile with an perfect alibi and tool to lure children."
WHATTTTT OMG
Timothee I hate him so much cuz I seen so many reports say he never earns or works for his roles he gets them all handed him like tf bro lazy a** actor and also I saw he makes girl uncomfortable on set smh I will never watch a movie with this loser in it
I wanna see this and this looks so good. Prequel to how Willy Wonka made his chocolate.
Rowan atkinson omggg
so very slayyyy
Wish they had Depp do this again.
Okay it made me smile it made me laugh. I’m charmed I’ll watch it😂
"It looks a bit too cringe for me, but I’m probably not the target audience. Kids are. So if they enjoy then good for them."
I’m curious what strong female character they will bring in to show Willy how to make chocolate and run a business?
Wow. 😮
Why make it we aleesxy had a einka film by Tim burton
No one asked for this?!?!?!
"Aku dah capek mikir, 
Kamu punya MR. Bean kamu punya kuasa"

Ok but who is she... & WHY?
anything to make a woke buck.
Jonka.
"nah this looks so good, captures the magic of willy wonka so well"
omg baaaangggg
But Why?
Hugh Grant playing the Oompa Loompas is so unexpected but perfect at the same time lmao
Can't beat the johnny depp willy wonka
Lets goo my boy timmmy
This is awesome ❤❤❤❤❤❤ 👌
For the love god i love the wonka movies please dont Ruin this one . Like how disney have
"idk yet what to feel about this but why does there have to be a ... i dont think it adds anything relevant to the plot.. oh well, anyway rowan atkinson and the oompa loompa can carry for now"
Willy wonka and Kylie Jenner's factory aka (Kylie cosmetics)
"Oh look, another remake....."
Alright. looks good.
i don't usually tear up from trailers
"Interesting, is reallt getting my attention."
"Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa, whats not to love!"
Didn't expect the legendary Mr. Rowan Atkinson to be in this movie. I bet the comedy elements will be top notch!
If Only the one and only Gene Wilder were still with us today.. ...would *LOVE* to hear his thoughts on this..
"I still think the prequel is unnecessary, but I’m nevertheless impressed with what they came up with...
Now I’m obliged to watch this when it releases"
No
Woke garbage
The best Christmas move😀😀
This is already my favorite movie. Willy Wonka is truly the best fictional character of all time.
"Must we remake everything again and again? Come on...
*watches trailer*
Oh... alright that's... yeah I'm down for this."
Oh so I finally have a movie about my name even I don’t remember exactly why I named this 😌
"There are so many things I can say about this, but I can’t wait for this movie. It has everything, WAIT, scratch that reverse it. But it looks perfect. I’m getting so many vibes from the original Gene Wilder. And the end was something I didn’t expect, but I loved it."
Mathew Baynton *and* Rowan Atkinson!!
Kind of wishing they had been more progressive in casting an actual Oompa Loompa.
"i have such high hopes for this film. chalamet is an extraordinary actor, and even at such a young age, his range is definitely something to praise. i think i have watched almost all the films he has been in but this is something entirely different. i hope the final product is as magical as i expect it to be. can't wait for december!!"
Looks awful
Жопка
MY JAW DROPPED WHEN I SAW ROWAN ATKINSON
Man I can't wait to watch this one for sure! Like Willy Wonka has been one of my favourite fantasies coz I love chocolates 😌💞
Look nice
Is this the same universe as Johnny Depp?
"Esta Pelicula Salvará a Warner de la Bancarrota.
Con Suerte las Familias Irán A Verla."
Just stop
"Not gonna lie, definitely came in pessimistic with priors that this was gonna be another hollow, exhausting, and unmotivated reboot, but by the end... idk this actually looks really charming"
"1:40 ""RUN AWAYYE"""
"What, when, how, whaaaaaat"
Umm... The flavour of HP... 🤤
"What, when, how, whaaaaaat"
omg finally
Wonka to the world of Wokes would be a more appropriate title
I can't wait for the Willy Wonka Cinematic Universe
F*cking Finally
I spend my whole life watching Johnny Deep as Willy Wonka. Now my heart can't accept Timothee as Willy Wonka.Even I know he is doing great.
I know we dont need it but if they do a sequel to this during the events of the original as a sorta reboot. And then maybe a third movie with charlie as the head?
This looks wonderful! I can’t wait to see it this Christmas! 😁🎞
Hopefully a cameo from Johnny Depp
Rowan Atkinson running away from a giraffe dressed as a priest. I'm in.
Will the movie show how he became a psychopath that started to kill children in his own factory and make songs about it?
Something about his performance feel off. It's like he's doing a Willy Wonka impression and not acting as Willy Wonka.
LOL-  Hollyweird doesn't have an original thought.  Not only do they keep repeating the same formula over and over they continue to remake the remakes.  It's beyond pathetic.
hope they let it rest after this tho
Hugh Grant as an OmpaLumpa!
Timotheē Chalatme you beauty.
Huh… charming.
I thought this was was already out 😅😅😅 wasn’t this announced back in 2021 or something
Stop. Making. British. Characters. American.

Timothy chalamet going from Dune to this is one of the biggest whiplashes I’ve ever seen and I’m honestly kind of here for it
The chocolate factory
1:52 THIS MUSIC IS THE GREATEST TRAILER MUSIC THE WORLDS EVER HEARD! TRUE!
I'm something of a magician myself
Am I supposed to believe this is a young gene wilder? Wtf..
yeah no thanks
760k views in one hour? Definitely bots!
Mr. Chalamet is really good at capturing elements of Depp & Wilder and making it his own
Lil Mabu
No no no no no.
No no no what??
"OK, I'm excited for this. How he got to be a big chocolate factory, is something I have wondered as a child, and answered as an adult."
Prequel to the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka then?
"Huh. I think this is the first time I like the story of ""the amazing chocolatier."""
Can to see how willy woka became to be
It’s funny how this is so fantastical and cheery when in the original he kept leaving behind children.
I'm just paying attention to Mr. Bean at 1:41
"I will say, the casting director nailed it"
"AH!!!!
 my world of pure imagination"
This could ruin my child hood or not but it must have some good jokes or else I will be depressed
Omggg this looks so good!!!
"HOPE they do The Great Glass Elevator and future films, because this franchise will run and run"
0.2 seconds in & im already out.
I prefer this take on the Oompa Loompa so much more than the synchronized clone CGI abominations we got with the Johnny Depp version. Though I did like the overall style of that movie a lot. This one looks very squeaky clean and sterile by comparison.
All the chalamet fangirls flooding this comment section.
👍
I love this trailer. It's gonna be an amazing movie. This year has so many amazing movies can't wait to watch all of them.
I’ll admit I wasn’t very amused by the idea of this movie but now that I saw a trailer I actually wanna see this
Johnny Depp AKA Willy Wonka ❤❤❤❤
жопка
Right. I am sick of this. Can we not FOR ONCE have Wonka that’s BRITISH?!?!
this looks like so much fun i can’t wait!
This is a very hard role - Not 100% sold on Timothee here - but I will hope for the best.
Wow this looks great and very epic and magical and I like the actor a lot he is one of my absolute favorite actor ever 😊❤
The final result of project Zeus.
Can't wait to watch this even though it probably sucks!
Tbh it's nothing compared to Johnny Depp's portrayal.
MR. BEANNNNNNNN IS IN THISSSSS
looks like a good time
"This movie looks like its gonna be a blast, definitely watchin this 🔥🔥"
"not a fan of the actor, but good casting choice."
wtf is this garbage
WONKUH. PUT YOUR EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER AWAY WONKUH. I'M NOT COMING INTO YOUR CHOCOLATE FACTORY RIGHT NOW WONKUH.
This new ai is very impressive
ok but why did the side character have to be black...
"Yes another Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory movie!! This was my favorite childhood movie.

Lots of likes!"
Why do they gotta remake and ruin classic movies just come up with an original idea for once Hollywood SMH
Warner Bros testing the water if they can replace johny deep for the next Pirates of the Caribbean

who up wonking they willy rn?
Enough time to binge the other movies first.
i hope this turns out to be amazing

Wonkalicious
this movie looks awesome can't wait to see it!
From the studio who bought you Harry Potter and X-men
"Блин, ну Тимоти как-то вообще не смотрится в этой роли. Да и приелся, имхо"
I wish they would stop making remakes but maybe l’ll watch this because Mr Bean is in it.
Looks like fun one for sure!
YESSSSS willy wonka is one of my fav movies
Best trailer so far this year
"When I saw the words harry potter I was like ""omg, that Reggie's fancast!"""
I love thissssss
Not again…
CHOCOLATE POWER
'Chocolate Cartel'. Now there's a cartel I'd like to deal with.
Didn't he also unite the Oompa Loompas and take the planet back from the Harkonnen?
This feels like it will take you on a beautifully nostalgic ride but with a fresh new perspective
❤❤❤❤❤
Great cast. Was this shot in a mall?
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
"I'm usually a skeptic when it comes to remakes/prequels/reimaginings, but this looks so cute! It's nice to see Timothee in a more whimsical role and some of my britcom faves are in it too!"
"Honestly he shouldn't be willy Wonka, he is far to serious. Wonka has a higher voice and is more childlike he plays it as a normal person whoxh is he not"
I like depp and wilder
I just purchased a chicolate and got notification of this 😂❤
Rhold dhal is the goat
Why is there a black supporting actress with the character Wonka??? There hasn’t been any history of Wonka with a black little girl???
Oh god another version of Willy wonka
THIS IS PERFECT!!! I got 100 happier seeing that timmy is Wonkaaa
High school production with planks of wood using deep fake technology. Will be forgotten like the last one.
"I’m Calling it , Willy wonka is the same universe as Harry Potter"
"“Every good thing in this world, starts with a dream. So you hold on to yours.”
- Willy Wonka’s Mom, 2023

That line got me crying. It’s sounds like something my mama would say to me."
Glad they didn't change his race
Looks like we got another Willy wonka movie
"The trailer looks magical! I can't wait to watch it! And oh is that Rowan Atkinson? I remember he was also in another Roald Dahl adaptation, The Witches! Seeing him again makes me smile 😊"
Truly looks like one of the worst movies to come out in years.
Damn timothee is very charismatic in this role
I like the one with Johnny Depp better
I was hoping it would be darker since he was playing Wonka. But I do not think this is going to be as good as previously predicted. Very Harry Potter Prequel vibed.
just stop already.
This doesn't look very good
This will either be absolutely horrible or absolutely amazing!
"I love Johnny Depp, not this kid who doesn't sing 🤢"
❤
Again Chalamet? There are no other actors?
its a let down to see that this film could not at least employ a dwarf to play the umpa loopa why use Hugh grant  superimposed badly onto a smaller figure ??? did they run out of money
"Gee, I wonder if any of the comments here were paid for by WB."
is that lil mabu
Another unnecessary background story whose only purpoise is make more money out of an original idea. Explain how Willy Wonka became himself is actually a way of killing him. You're actually killing the mystery and the fantasy about his background all at once. And what an awful acting is that!
"Excellent trailer, I'm already looking forward to seeing that movie and it seems that its chocolates and sweets will taste like Oscar"
dull and generic
Timothee Chalamet is becoming the new Johnny Depp.
I still like like johnny depp in it
I’m offended that Wonka is not performed by a black transgender!
"Johnny Depp's as wonka is real good, it's hard to beat that"
"Finally, with this and snowpiercer, the trilogy is done"
AYO THATS THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORIES
Wait Mr bean also in there
"1:42 Rowan Atkinson cameo 
Alright I am watching this"
"Anyone else is gonna rewatch the Mr beast's video where he build a ""Willy Wonka chocolate factory in real life !?"" 😜"
I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good
WOW Ashoka looks great!
Ahh I miss this franchise so much
"oh i loooove timmy finally getting to be overtly silly for this role, i see the vision"
these days only cartoon movies !!!
Chocolate......is a serious business........XD
"the big question is
whould Roald Dahl have approved of this idea?
as he despised the 1971 version (that is why no other film version was made while he was alive, the 1971 version ruined his story)
but according to his family, he whould have loved the 2005 version
also seeing a radioactive carrot person as an Oompa Loompa, instead of an tiny humans from the rainforest, is just wrong"
Doesn't look like the good old willy we knew. We'll see nevertheless.😊
Best part of this whole trailer: 02:05
"I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary. But I gotta admit, this looks quite good. And Timothee is very talented!"
"I'm...actually okay with the idea of this? Maybe it's using the original motif in the score, maybe it's the idea that a whimsical approach with a supporting cast to distract from Chalamet's over-the-top voice could make this work, but I'm down to see this."
Why?
Gene Wilder would be proud.
lil bro acting like Floop in Spy Kids 1💀
Mr Bean!
I would make the joke “If the WB network made a Willy Wonka remake” buttttt this is literally that.
Not Johnny Depp as willy wonka
AWESOME
"I don’t like my childhood memories being played with, but Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa does intrigue me. Big sigh!"
It's exploring parts of the book we only ever hear about and I daresay he's channeling Gene Wilder as well. LOVE IT.
Mr.Bean: run away ...😬
Only Johnny depp suits wonka
"Я думаю ""Почему на превью к видео курсивом написано 'Жопка' "", А это оказалась надпись Wonka
(Простите, сама от себя не ожидала)"
"I'm here for the chocolate, Willy Wonka, but most importantly: Mathew Baynton and Simon Farnaby❤"
Se nota que atacarán a la religión mínimo
Ah! Our favorite colonizer has returned...
Ugh pass
❤❤
This looks delightful.
I’m sorry I don’t bye Timothee as wonka
Looks like Warner Bros has adopted Timothee Chalamet. No complaints. Good cast 😊
Why am I crying?!?!
Looks really good and interesting... If the reviews are positive sounds like it will be an amazing movie. Timothee has the carrer Tom Holland dreams of. The trick is Holland: You try to find parts that will challenge you and not thinking you are the great action hero and doing a mediocre Uncharted. As long as you don't understand that you won't ever outgrow Spider-Man.
Lol charlies a black girl now
Looks really entertaining.. would be nice to see how it all started for Willy Wonka.🍬🍭🍫
P-E-R-F-E-C-T Casting !!!!!!
Willy Wonka is an emotion...I love and respect him soooooo much...and for me...Mr Johny Depp is the best Wonka in this world ❤❤...but I love Timothee...after Mr Depp he's the 2nd best Wonka ☺️☺️❤️❤️...Gooooooo Tim...God bless you and the entire team of Wonka🙏🙏🙏♥️♥️♥️
The perfect actor for this
ain’t no way that Wonka shop goes to Kylie😢
This is gonna be cute
way too much fake CG. More weird like Tim Burton's Alice in Wonderland than the true silver screen magic of Padington or original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
"Another Willy Wonka movie? First, there's Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971), then there was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, then Tom & Jerry, and now this."
whoever said olivia coleman never turns down a script was so right 😩😩
Terrible casting for Wonka
Meh
Timothee is gonna make Gene proud.
Another remake? No new ideas for years now....
Timothee Chalamet is awesome ! one of my fav actors
what's with the accents? where is this film based? lol
I would expect spice melange flavoured chocolate then
I'm going to just say it - he's not right for the role 😬 it's so cringe but maybe that's how they wanted him to play it
I didn’t know lil mabu s twin was an actor
"Still can't beat Depp's performance, this isn't even close!"
This willy wonka is different from the one portrayed by depp...but lets wait 😊
"I would pay for see Johnny Depp as Mr. Wonka but that never will possible because clearly 18 years have been passed now from the secuel film in 2005 and he is now lot more older, but with AI can be possible restore his youngerhood, beauty and physical/sexual attractive in his face and body"
0:39 I would have a life sentence bc I'm always daydreaming
Eh.
"I initially wanted to watch this because of Timothee Chalamet the production photos looked great. But finally, seeing this trailer excites me to watch it even more!! I cannot wait to see this in theaters after watching Dune 2 in theaters as well of course! It looks so magical, fun, and whimsical <3"
"Rowan Atkinson in the confession and ""Once we've started dancing we can't stop"" *turns around and bends over* 😭😭
Also I'm going to have to eat something sweet and tasty or this movie will torment me"
thanks i hate it
"Can't wait for this ""CHOCOLATY EXPERIENCE"" !!"
No Dady dreaming
"Every record has been destroyed or falsified, every book rewritten, every picture has been repainted, every statue and street building has been renamed, every date has been altered. And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute. History has stopped. Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right. - George Orwell, 1984. Stop the woke censorship."
great trailer but timothee's acting is not it in this trailer it feels like he's forcing himself to play willy other cast are great but timothee didnt pull of that magic you know
"Dang, really can't wait for another prequel of Snowpiercer!"
He has the look but I don't think he has the charisma to pull off the character like Gene Wilder. I don't see the same unpredictable zaniness that typified  Gene's portrayal.
LOL i wonder if boba fett makes a cameo!!
"Babe, wake up! Wonka origin story just dropped!"
"Grew up with Gene Wilder as Wonka. Loved the Wonka gag in the 2000s. The world needs Wonka, especially now."
He fits in this far better than the lead of Dune
Well..... this looks mediocre.
I'm already loving this since I saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory when I was 6
how do you not realize how awful this looks
THIS. THIS IS WHAT I WANT FROM YOU DISNEY. Not princess stories. BACKGROUMD CHARACTERS WE ABSOLUTELY *LOVE* stories 🥹
"So a prequel, better than a remake....again"
timothy charlatan truly one of the least charismatic actors this decade perhaps......... i need him and his square jaw to get OUT
omg its horrible histories guy
Looks terrible... This will bomb hard.
Hopefully this movie doesn't flop.
"Лайк, если зашёл сюда ради Жопки"
This looks fun!  I think we can all use some happiness!
"This guy might not look very much like the original in young, but his acting looks promising"
"Rowan Atkinson is in... okay, I'm sold."
Here we go mama❤
Cringe af
"timmothée is so miscast, has no comedic timing like DEPP. its going to be a BORE."
Ugh.
Trash
The trilogy is complete.
1:40 That’s was unexpected to see Mr. Bean appearance in this movie 😮
Nostalgic 😊🧡
"On paper, nothing about this should work, so why did this trailer make me so happy?"
"Roald Dahl the man who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has been censored by the publishing company Puffin. George Orwell,  another famous British author warned of the dangers of rewriting books, movies and history. End the woke madness."
Brace yourselves all the White Crystal worshiper ladies  are coming
"finally, the Jonka movie!!!"
WHATT
I feel Gene Wilder smiling
finally
vibes disney but it's Warner Bros 😂
"This Wonka looks and acts like Daniel Thrasher, the piano guy from YouTube and Facebook."
Nope
Yeah? Willi Wonka without Johnny depp  yeah? Uh huh umm hmm okay
What a legacy to have movies made even today on your childrens' books❤
I can’t wait for the post credit scene of Charlie being born
"Remember when people had original ideas instead of ""remaking"" the same story every 5-10 years?"
get ready for willy wonka 2
I did it
This looks looks a feel-good movie which this year really needs. And plus THERES ROWAN ATKINSON!
yah beda cerita sm yg dulu ya?
"Though not related to both the original Willy Wonka movie and the Tim Burton’s 2005 remake, this looks very sweet, magical, and charming."
Timothee Chalamet does not fit this role. His acting took me right out of the magic of this trailer.
Жопка́
The Willy Wonka movie we never knew we needed.
I do not like Timothy Chalamet
okay
"People seemingly and unanimously hated on Johnny Depp’s portrayal at release, Heath Ledger as Joker, Robert Pattinson as Batman - always good to give actors a chance"
magical!
something is so of
WHY WHY WHY WHY???? :/
Who up wonking they willy rn
Seriously? Another Wonka movie just to add the “precious” representation?
Directed and written by the man who made paddington? It's gonna be a masterpiece.
Is this a pre-quel to how Willy Wanka got his start that wiuld lead into a movie like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory?!
Rowan Atkinson? I'm in
This looks bland.
"I'll be taking this as a prequel to the first movie and not the remake seeing that the Oompa Loompa, is, well.... orange."
"Honest question, i never got a chance to try a wonka bar. Was it good?"
Didn't even feel like 2:27 minutes
hahahahahahhahahahahahahahha
Wow this looks bad
Ugh
Timothee went from being Paul Atreides to Willy Wonka in one year is just amazing.
That looks... boring
"I see Timothee Chalamet, I go see the movie"
Cool
too many black people
"This looks awesome. But please, just make something new!"
Interesting 🤔
This is the most beautiful trailer I have ever seen. I absolutely love Timothee chalamet as willy Wonka.
"When something looks this much like a ridiculous, pointless flop in the trailer you just know the film itself is going to be a special kind of garbage."
I don't know how I feel about CGI oompa loopa
"Wish we would have gotten a continuation of the story with Charlie running the factory using the original cast, not another reboot that’s gonna change stuff."
oh my god whattt??? This is going to be interesting!
Soooo unnecessary
"They went woke with this casting black supporting actors who wouldn't be around in this timeline. Other than that, it looks pretty good."
"This looks like Timothée is doing a cookie Johnny Depp impression....Why isn t this a prequel to Gene Wilder s version of the character ? This is just goofy without any spark of sarcasm, intelligence or wit."
Wow that looks awful
Omg the hype is real
"Another Male Actor with 2 Huge Projects coming out in one Year with no Female Accusations whatsoever? Well, Somethings about to Change!

(Johnny Depp and Jonathan Majors)"
Willy Woke-a
another woke movie no one asked for...
"Who asked for the story of Willy Wonka?  We don't want to know the origins of Willy Wonka or how much he struggled to start his factory, I was bored and sleepy watching this trailer And I just woke up"
So many black people because it's a woke film
Ohoo  realy  thanks for  bring back old memories  🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺
"I can't see Timy as Willy, I see Timmy wearing a costume of Willy Wonka, you know what I mean?"
Looks good wonka
No one can replace Johnny deep
"The movie seems really really good better than I expected but Timothe Chalamet playing Wonka, I just don't see it like the voice, the narration it really doesn't work for me I hope I'll forget about it while watching it but I wish they would've look for others actors maybe."
“ Chocolate cartel “ 😂 wtf
Nice to see a movie studio taking an original movie and milking it. I can already see where this is going
"Can't wait to watch the origin story of a man who wants to drug everybody, and make them obese. What's with Hollywood and unnecessary origin stories? Willy Wonka is much better from the Charlies perspective, where Wonka is mysterious, scary, where you're intrigued what's in the factory.. then you find out everything out. No one wants to see how he comes up with recipes, and becomes rich."
“Too late. I’ve started dancing and once we’ve started dancing we can’t stop” 😂
This looks cheesy but the oompa loompa got me
"2:05
Wonka: So you’re the funny little man who’s been following me.
Oompa Loompa: I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectable size for an Oompa Loompa.
Wonka: An Oompa what now?
Oompa Loompa: Allow me to refresh your memory.
2:15
Wonka: Oh, I don’t think want to hear that.
Oompa Loompa: Too late. I’ve started dancing now. Once we start, we can’t stop."
million views in an hour 😮
Why?
Snowpiercer prequel has finally arrived.
Was not fully interested - until I saw Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompa.  Now a must see!
"As a ""Charlie and the choclate factory"" fan, I can't wait to see this. ❤😍🔥"
"This gives a lot of Dolittle vibes, but if it was better in every way. Can’t wait to see it"
Bro went from Muadib to Wonka
"he is not perfecting chocolate, he is perfecting cringe"
Looks great 😊
Remind me... Jonny....
MR CARSON from Downton Abbey!!  I'm so happy to see Jim Carter in such a big film!  I'm probably more excited for him than anyone else lol..
Omg! So excited about this. Seeing Rowan in this film is just pure joy!
1:39 love to see Mr Bean 😂😂😂
"At first I was like meh, then you showed me Hugh Grant as an oompa lumpa. Now I’m all a board."
Who up wonking they willys rn 😩🔥
Mr Bean and Willy Wonka? Yesss🎉
"Willy wonka 
Lets gooooo"
"Maaaaaaan, I ain't even gonna hate. I was sold in the first 10 seconds. This genuinely looks like a great movie."
"Timothy is simply incapable of frivolity. What a dead, middle-school performance."
I’m so excited to watch this movie! Willy Wonka movies are so exciting to watch for the whole family
Perfect character selection.. ❤‍🔥🙌
พดาหล
ЖОПКА
I'm hungry for candy
nice to see Danial Thrasher step up in his acting career
Oh look Hollywood making something to distract us from the fact they were exposed for exploiting children and trafficking. Nice try.
"Wonka's Youth, That is impressive because he is an adult in Charlie's movie"
I guess chocolate is one way to cope with spice addiction
Since I watched the 2005 movie I have been THE BIGGEST FAN OF WILLY WONKA and everyday would wait for the trailer of the 2023 WONKA omg I AM SOOOO HYPED I SWEAR!!!! 💗💗
"Now the only question I have is if this is a prequel to the 70s version or 2000s but love this!

1:03 IS THAT MR BEAN!?"
Timmy is so checked out in this role he does not care at all 😂
it looks like fantastic beasts and gives off the greatest showman
Couldn't even finish the trailer. Embarrassingly bad.
"Starring the giraffe from Hangover 3, 1:41"
If I had to make this film I would have just ripped off 'perfume' 😋
Can't wait
"Wow, I really like this wonka!"
The Johnny Depp film was bad enough and now this. There's only one Willy Wonka and his name is Gene Wilder.
Timothee is good...No Doubt! But I badly miss Johnny Depp when his characters come again on screens❤
"Lame. I thought it was based on the reboot. I wanted headgear, ""papa"" and tribal oompa loompas. He is doing the Depp voice tho."
wait this got me so excited for christmas already and it’s june rn 😭😭
His acting is terrible... Literally Disney channel level of acting.  🤮🤢🤮
una caca💩
"0:39 Man, that's strict."
I'm crying....😭😭😭😭😭❤‍🩹❤
Mr. Bean as a priest? Sign me up.
Idk
Timothee Chalmet and Rowan Atkinson together? That's the craziest thing I've ever seen
"Special request: Can commenters please just stop using the “didn’t know I needed” hyperbole. 

Reason being: It’s really draining the culture to be so reliant on memes, not to mention being so clearly ignorant about what one needs. No one “needs” Rowan Atkinson, no offense to the actor. 

Suggestion: If offering feedback, come up with something original to say."
This is woke propaganda that the left is pushing to promote transgender to our children
God Almighty! Hollywood is DEAD! Same stories !!!! Remade. The actor from ‘Hulu’ would’ve been great as Wonka.

"WTF is this where the chocolate factory and fat kids chowing on chocolate!
Terrible choice for Wonka!"
Wasn't 2 enough?
that looks legit!!
Fantastic beasts but with chocolate
I have questions about Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and I'm afraid that I won't find answers.
An American Willy Wonka?
"Maybe it's just me, but I think this just takes the magic out of the mystery and allure around Wonka. Personally, I just don't think it's a story that needs telling."
Ughhh
"this seems goofy, can’t wait!"
Gives me Wonka origins feeling
They were waiting for timothee to grow up for this role! Perfect
"It would be great if Warner Brothers did a remake of the Quest for Camelot (1998), The Snow Queen (1999), Fearless Four (1997) and The Wizard of Oz (1939)."
Is the chocolate named Wonka's Whipple Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight  ??
always a treat seeing Rowan Atkinson no matter how big the role
"Sory,not a fan of choco flavor spice"
Rowan Atkinson ❤
O M G..... this Prequel PELASE BE GOOD. and this just confirms that Tim burtons verison is well a total mess
So Is this a prequel to Johnny Depp's Willy Wonka or Gene Wilder's versions?
"Dune boy didn't do enough research/ character building to follow Wilder, America always use crappy puns (whipped cream 😭) it's not clever, Wonka originally balanced self contradictive statements like balancing sweet and sour, weilded paradoxes like cloth, topped it off with a sprinkle of effortlessness (couldn't even fall over if he tried 😋)) 
IAM good 😇   ...too good 🤙😇"
who thought this was a good idea
Willywog
It looks so good!!
I cant't wait! The cast is insane! My jaw was on the floor throughout the video. Timothee has an extraordinary career going on.
oh god seeing mr bean instantly put a smile on my face
"As optimistic as I could be about this film, I just have this sinking feeling that it's not going to live up to expectations. 

We've been burned badly by Hollywood a lot the last 7 years. 

Trying to fill the shoes of Gene Wilder, the best actor to ever put on the Wonka hat, is a near impossible task at best.

 (Sorry, Johnny Depp, but your version doesn't count.)"
"Harry Potter, Fantastical Beasts, Netflix's Unfortunate events, Tim Burtons Wonka, this NEW Wonka, etc... They all seem like the same reality, is there a name for this genre?"
"Big pass, This story in general has too many subliminals to name"
And the next massive flop will be ...
Fantastical
No thanks.
"I always admired Timothee's work, and it brings my heart joy to see him do the role of one of my beloved childhood classics. <3 I can't wait to see this."
I don’t even care for Timothee but he somehow work’s perfect here
WB seem to love Timothée rn. He is very talented. hoping for this to be good and Dune p2
Eh idk about this one
I  now lived enough to see Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa...
Mat baynton my beloved
I’m literally going to see this just because of Hugh grant as an oompaloompa 🤣🤣
"“Every good thing in this world started with a dream, so you hold onto your’s.” 
Thankyou for my new favourite quote!"
Why the heck is Hugh Grant an umpa  Loompa like I can’t omg 💀
YAY🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉🎉
This looks really bad sorry. Chalamet isn’t a good actor. Atleast the burton remake had a different take.
Charlie and the chocolate factory ❤️❤️
"i was not looking forward to this at all, kind of hate the idea of it existing especially after the terrible Depp film

i love the OG film one of my all time favourites

but then i started during the trailer getting Paddington vibesand then it said the same director Paddington 1 & 2 so i am sold on it now it looks really fun"
"Ooh, I got chills.

Roald Dahl, Rowan Atkinson, Hugh Grant, Olivia Colman and Matt Lucas = a soon-to-be Christmas classic, no doubt."
I love the old one but will see this and enjoy it too cos it’s different
"This will work,"
the Chocolate Cartel lmfaoooo 💀
Why are they turning American classics to the UK.
"Idk, bruh... I'm not digging Timothy Charlemagne as Wonka..."
Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite book as a kid. I’m definitely excited to see this movie being made
"WW
Willy wanka
Walter white 😧"
thr forced comedy is killing me bro
I didn't think I needed it until I saw it
"But… elijah wood exists… disappointed 
The kids these days are trash actors"
How much did he snort that sand?
Good lord can people make something original?
Bruh who tf asked
timothée captures wonka’s energy so well from this trailer alone
"In the meantime, that worthless Grandpa Joe continues to lay about in bed."
I'm in!
WANKA
Dune et Wonka et CHALAMET 🙇🏼
This guy is going to be the hottest male lead for the next two or three decades. Hes talented enough to pull it off.
I remember the days when disney used to make movies like this such a shame they chose to go woke over keeping the magic for kids.
"I’m an absolute fan of timothee chalamet, and I cant wait to see him portray Wonka. Super excited for this film."
so many good movies coming this year
Well this just looks so good 😂❤
Trash. Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka. This is trash.
"I love the part where Rey says she's a Skywalker. So bold, so brave."
"this timothy dude should be blacklisted from movies forever, he cant act"
Looks absolutely magical
"Im not sure I can see timothee as Wonka, he doesnt rly have that ""unhinged"" vibe - but we shall see! I might very well be wrong!"
is he selling drugs ?
Why?
"I have to admit it, even I want to see it after all the moaning I've done about modern films.
Please don't be woke please don't be woke please don't be woke."
"I wasn't expecting to be dazzled and delighted by a Wonka trailer this morning, yet here we are."
Idk if the humor of this is doing it for me
Gene wilder : Im the willy wonka !
why is willy wonka southern?
It’s funny how Hollywood wants to cast this guy in everything
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!! IM DEFINITLEY GOING TO GO SEE IT!!
Willy wonka chocolate>>>> mrbeast chocolate
"I love the fact that he uses One of Wonka’s  famous lines from the Original classic Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory .scratch that, reverse it."
"The only mad-inventor movie on my must-see list.  Sorry, Mr. Nolan."
Not me crying. 😂
People are forgetting the original movie exists. Everyone’s talking about Johnny Depp’s version. Look at the Oompa Loompa. It’s clearly from the 1971 version. And you can hear Pure Imagination in the trailer. That’s from the original movie too. This is not a prequel to the Johnny Depp movie people
Timothee Clam as Wonka? In what world is that?
Pls don't let it be a musical
"They gave Wonka a White Savior subplot and called it diversity lol. Anyway, Chalamet looks to be in good form here."
The chocolate cartel 💀
Well I was smiling all the way up until 2:06 caught me off guard
"When Timothy was cast as Willy Wonka, I doubted anyone will be able to recreate Depp's magic, but this looks promising."
This the nun 2 and the Meg 2 I literally didn’t expect a sequel fir these at all and we don’t even need them😂
MATHEW BAYNTON MATHEW BAYNTON
I don’t think so .
We love similar movies I really liked Mr. Bean character
OOMPA LOOMPA
"Many of us didn't expect for the movie to turn out like this, but here we are, looks good and interesting, I'm definitely gonna go see it on day 1 that's for sure"
MATTHEW BAYNTON AND ROWAN ATKINSON IN THE SAME FILM???? I'm so there.
"Hugh Grant playing an Oompa Loompa , he really hit the bottom of the barrel but I still can't wait to see it"
omg. is this gonna be a musical?! im in!!!
I see Mr. Rowan 💙
"THE MUSIC IS SO EPIC!!!!!!
I WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! 🤩🤩🤩"
I  have a bad feelings  about this .... feel  uts gonna be woke
"Damn it, I'm in."
Looking forward to it
"We have Johnston, Charles the II and Dafydd from Little Britain all in one film..."
"bruhhh this look so bad lmao and also whats up with the top comments, they sound like bots"
Oh dear….
I thought it was @Danielthrasher
Paul Atreides making chocolates..?
How many re-makes have to come out of Hollywood. They have no originality any more.
he should have used a high voice in his performance
Not impressed 😂😂😂😂
"Visually this looks alright, but alas I am spoiled on the Gene Wilder portrayal of Wonka. He played an eccentric, mysterious, dark, and  friendly madman all too well, and Chalemet just seems too straight laced in this version."
2023 IT'S GIVING US MOOOVIES
OMG is that the highway man guy from horrible histories?!!!! (Mathew John Bayten)
Looks more wilder than depp and I love depp just not his wonka
"You ruinned, you ruinned and i leaving"
"I'm just asking you; After charlie and the chocolate factory and johnny depp, do you think this movie is okay? What is this after Johnny's wonka character? its youth? It has nothing to do with the character of Wonka. You made a movie about the story of a boy who loves chocolate. Congratulations."
It's only Alan Johnson! Good to see him back on the screen!
Wait wasn’t Wonka’s father a dentist? Where’s he?
Thank goodness Willy winks isn’t race swapped gender identity spitting political pandering loser like every other film coming out now. This actually looks really fun and good! I might actually take my family to the movies to see this 😮
HUGH GRANT IS AN OOMPA LOOMPA 😭
"Interesting, curiosity peaked."
Immer diese moralischen Botschaften am Ende jedes Trailers 😂. Ein Film den wir nicht gebraucht haben. Und es kommt nicht an den Charm des 1. Films heran.
"Looks like this movie is totally missing the Dahl edge. His books always had a dark humor to them, I don't see that in the trailer sadly"
Why do we need another Wonka movie? Money is why 💵
Lies of P the movie
Lisan al-gaib!
are we already living in a time when the AI overlords have taken over and decided that every movie should start this chalamet guy?
That movie featuring Johnny Depp was better.
Excited for this one. The plot looks quite interesting.
"I'm only going to see this to watch Rowan Atkinson scream ""Run Away!""."
Looks much better than the Depp version.
I am totally bought when I saw Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa! Take my money!!!!
How is this different from Johnny Depp’s version?
not that this ever needed a prequel but Ryan Gosling was right there COME ON
Wanted a cameo with Johnny Depp!
It's make me laugh when i saw mr.beam
Ahhhhhh Willy Wonka . I want to be his apprentice ❤
Didn't even come close to JOHNNY
Timothée Chalamet doesn't feel eccentric enough to be Wonka. He's too grounded...
"The Willy Wonka movie we never knew we needed, but now absolutely need to watch. 'Nuff said."
This guy should play luffy
Billions of true stories. and they make a wonka prequel.... Give us better stories. You can tell Hollywood writers are on strike or deserve to be paid trash for writing this.
"Why  cast some  baby face guy as Wonka?
But I guess Mr. Bean balances that out."
Yay more destruction of literature for one sided political agenda! Yay! Creating new properties is just too hard. More hand me downs I guess
The Harry Potter logo makes its more interesting 😮
THIS!!!! THIS IS MY JOKER
I love Timothee but he just seems like he’s trying too hard. I guess we’ll have to wait and see.
"Dear god, the whimsy, the wonder"
The film’s logo “Wongaka” is quite similar to Thai alphabet 'พดาหล (Padahon)' but it's mean nothing. 😂
Looks good.
❤
Man this looks fun and cute
At least wonka is still the same color
1:01: AIN'T NO WAY IT'S THE GOAT MR BEAN HIMSELF❤
"Oh, so that's dance from The Love Actually was a rehearsal..😂 love it for Hugh Grant ❤"
"After being unable to prevent the mass genocide in his name, Paul Atreides time traveled to a simpler time to restart his life as a business man"
this looks good
Timothée Chalamet really manages to capture both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder's excentric behaviour
Interesting!❤️‍🔥
Damn this is magical. I can't wait to see it!!!!
Restore the Snyder verse!!!
....meh........Cillian/Leo got nothing to worry about this award season.......
"Wow so instead of the typical Charlie & the chocolate factory we get a deep back story of Willy this time; obviously this was long overdue. This looks pretty damn nice, definitely gotta get me a chocolate almond hersey if I go see this"
What country is this set in?
getting Goosebumps while watching this trailer
Waiting for it
Looks amazing!
Johnny Depp looks really young here
PLEASE make something that will teach us a valuable lesson instead of giving us nightmares 😭
Just tell me how he makes the scary tunnel
Honest opinion? Johnny Depp plays the role SO much better
well..mmm don't ask me
I always thought of Timothee being a second Johnny Depp:)
I like how Timothee channels a lot of Gene Wilder's energy while still making it his own take of the character. His performance will definitely be a standout for this film.
How many times they gonna make this movie common 👎
ANITHER ONE OMMGMGGGG
He’s too young to play Willy wtf
THI
Gene Wilder is smiling from heaven right now RIP ❤
Wow. A very different take. I like it
"Was waiting for the creepy, accoustic cover of ""Pure Imagination"" to show up like all the trailers like this...

And there it is at the 0.04 mark."
This doesn’t look good
"Wow, they couldn't have chosen a better Willy Wonka. I saw and heard a lot of Johnny Depp mannerisms who played Wonka in the remake. Excellent casting choice and I can't wait to see it!! 😁"
It’s just Harry Potter with candy
At least they're acknowledging that the 1971 Gene Wilder version is the one to base it.
Wow
I was curious…. Now I’m excited 😆!!!! 12.15 let’s go!!!! WonkaVision like Mike Teevee!!!!
"That kid doesn't look or act anything like Willy Wonka to me, Hugh Grant would have been a better Wonka!"
the lies of P prequel looks amazing
1:41 was that Mr Bean???
Someone please deepfake Timothy’s face with Daniel Thrasher!
"Yeah,  he's a good actor but I'm really not feeling this movie."
Does everything and everyone need a origin story??..
"Chalamet is a good actor but I just don't see it. Wilder and Depp, although vastly different Wonkas, were so magical in their roles it is hard to imagine anyone coming close to their excellence. I am happy to see this is seemingly more of an origin story, though."
Looks interesting. The black girl is diversity casting
Not up to the level Johnny depp has marked
Rowan atkinson??? 🥹😭 ok im sold
"The 'magic moments', the sudden 'insight', the closeup on silly faces followed by quick cuts of theatrically dismayed co-stars, the absurd wokeness, the PC XTC, the whispered dialogue (so you know they are priceless epiphanies), the random fanfare fillers as camera pans over 'incredible' landscapes/cities, the suddenly choreographed crowds followed by instant harmless puns ideated by 8 year olds, the celebrity cameos...""alright, move along, nothing to see here, it's just a bunch of mediocre CGI""...
I know, I know - I could just avoid the movie.
But then again, the trailer forced me here.
Hats off to the WB marketing ensuring the unfiltered adulation comments were here first."
"Why bother making new films when you can milk an existing IP. Isn't that your always your approach, Warner Bros?
Please think of something original!"
I like that they arent copying the other two  films made and trying something new. I think weve all wanted an in depth back story too Willy Wonka and this is going to be excellent
F this no Jhonny no money. Ain't watching
"When Paul Muad'Dib Atreides conquered the known universe, he needed a new challenge. And thus, the Wonka Chocolate Factory."
This is gonna be magical ✨ love from India 🇮🇳❤️
"Looks pretty good overall, but Timothée Chalamet looks a bit too overly jovial to play Wonka in a convincing way."
This will bomb horribly.
the legend that is Matthew Bayton has once again graced us with his presence
Still think he should be cast in a Syd Barrett biopic.
"Wilder and Depp gave this weird, on-the-verge-unhinged insanity/creative charisma to Wonka that made him a memorable character. Tim just does not give that same vibe 🤷‍♀️"
Tuff
Diversity Quota ✅
"I legit teared up when the orchestral version of ""Pure Imagination"" swelled. My God, it's beautiful."
"This trailer killed all the excitement I had for this film. I loved previous Wonka films and I think Timothée Chalamet is an excellent actor, but his performance seems somehow off and forced as this character. There's also a problem with the tone they are going for. Wonka is supposed to be a complex, unpredictable and sometimes scary character. This trailer is overly sweet, with none of the bitterness any good chocolate should have."
I only remember seeing Johnny depp as wonka
We know rowan atkinson even with just a split second screen time😆😆
This looks pretty good.
Chalamet looks like he's having more fun here than his last four movies combined.
It doesn't need to exist
I was just wondering the other day about when the Wonka movie was going to be released and I’m so happy that we finally got a trailer! I’m excited for this movie 😊
"Something different for Wonka, Love it. Can't wait to see it."
ОПЯТЬ НЕГРИТОСЫ ДА ШОЖ ТАКОЕ-ТО
"he’s got the personality of a Disney kid actor, 0% of me wanted him as willy wonka, -100% of me didn’t want another Willy wonka. Will be bad"
Why does it remember me the maad hatter from alice?
Johnny depp as Willy Wonka no one can replace him
Woah was not expecting this!
Make new movies! There must be great scripts out there waiting for a chance.
"I know for sure that the movie is gonna be hella good but the trailer doesn't do it Justice,"
Starring Timothy Chalamet playing as Johnny Depp
So the ending of this trailer implies that Wonka is SPECIFICALLY a prequel to the 1970’s Gene Wilder movie then? That’s fun!
Johnny Depp ❤️
"""Disney Meets the Wizarding World""🤗✨️
Timothee Chalamet incarnated as Willy Wonka is impressive and I'm so much excited for this. The magical grandeur, fancy dances, colourful embroidery and the Wonka's origin story has amazed me. Director Paul King has yet again crafted a gem like Paddington 1 & 2. Exploring Willy's journey while Oompa-Loompas making a part in this new original story. Trailer has gifted a splendid yet magically crafted, a candy maker's journey.."
Cringe
"You had me at Rowan Atkinson, that man is a living legend."
❤❤❤
no one can replace Johnny Depp
Ok i thought this would be cringe when I first heard about it but I think this could be good
Did he really give Wonka a hayseed accent?
"I thought this would be a remake again. At the beginning I thought “Nah, this can't beat those 2!” 
But a prequel, that's new and I'm really curious what the song sounds like"
"Yeah no, as soon as I saw from the producer of harry potter I tuned out. I'm not supporting that witch."
Finally an excuse to head to theatres again
"If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then there's no stopping him.
You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka."
.....no
Something I never knew I needed in life.
didn't expect to see hugh grant as an oompa loompa but here we are
"How many POC will we employ to meet our DEI?
WB: Yes.
Seriously, rich POC in post war London? Lol"
I can't help myself but Willy Wonka without Jonny Depp is idk
"Wow. I’m usually always on board for everything even just a little bit because I love movies in general and I actually love Timothee Chalamet… I have a bunch of his movies!!! But this trailer left me with this sinking feeling in my chest. Idk how to describe it except for… what does Gen Z say… “this looks trash”

And I loved the new Little Mermaid"
"Finally, A perfect Christmas movie after a long time."
❤😮
This is something I've been wanting forever. I'm so excited
That guy looks like he has his pronounce on instagram page
Is that.... Mr.Bean ??? OK I am in. Looks exciting.
So was it intentional Wonka's (probably) girlfriend would have a... chocolate complexion?
Is that Alan Johnson wtf ..
This looks sick. And the director is the one from Paddington. I don't need anything more. I want to watch this.
MR BEAN!!!
🤍🤍🤍🤍
"In the first few seconds I'm not quite sure about this one but when I watched the whole trailer, it seems more than worth to watch! Congrats in advance my Timothée Chalamet! 🍫🤠🍫"
Honestly I am quite impressed with this trailer. It piqued my interest. Willy Wonka still holds a special place in m my childhood.
This looks terrible
"Nothing ever original anymore. 2020s recipe: remake something but add woke ingredients. Hopefully I'm wrong for this one, but odds aren't good."
ngl im gunna watch this so much
Looks Mid
"No, just no man.."
"Timothy Chalamet is giving me some Daniel Thrasher vibes in this trailer, and that gives me hope"
So... where's the part where he creates the Eternal Engine and launches a giant ark train around the world?
Im addicted to chocolate because of the book and movies and now I am gonna relapse
"Timothee has the charisma of a teaspoon but Hugh Grant cracked me up!! That man has charisma for the both of them 🤣🤣🤣 the movie looks amazing!! I'll endure Timothee to enjoy this one! (I like Timothee, but this is not his best role. He doesn't look engaging at all. But that could change in the runtime, but from the trailer, not convinced)"
Yoooooo is that mf mr bean?????
Everyone gonna like it cuz ooh it has a young hot actor woooaah
This makes me realized how difficult acting actually is. His acting and Johnny Depp's are too far apart.
No one tell Little Joel about this.
So much (poor quality) VFX... It taking away all the magic they're trying to convey.
Oompa loompa was damn funny 😂
Love the original not ready for a Hollywood remake just yet. Why??!!
I’m good. Already looks woke and to dark for me.
Willy Wonka. Charly and the cholate factory sequel. the owner of the cholate factory
its perfect its actually perfect
The worst movie trailer i have ever seen
This looks kinda corny ngl… I’m still gonna watch AND like it but
Timothee Chalamet ❤
THAT AIN'T WILLY WONKA THAT'S WILLIAM WACOM
looks like woke garbage lol.... going to bomb fantastically
Did anyone see mr bean?😂
The one thing that made the first movie so good is there were no black people
GOOFY
This looks so delightful
Never expected a prequel to such a classic film
is that Rowan Atkinson????
It's averaging over 100k views per 10 min
"And you're still never gonna adapt the actual Wonka sequel. I wonder why.
Maybe stop milking old properties and create something original?"
"I've mixed reaction. The two moments when I've smiled were the ""priest"" running and the ""oompa loompa"" singing. I don't like the ""breathy"" talking at all, it distracts me too much from the story itself. It makes me think that the characters suffer from asthma and are about to suffer a stroke."
Now we have Willy Wonka backstory too 😂
"This trailer filled me with childish Joy... If they succeed and still respecting Gene his legacy... Then i would definitely try to watch it when it comes  out. .. sorry JD,.. Gene was and still is the only real one.But you already knew this. 😉"
Nice 😊
"All I hope for at this point is that there is more of a character arc for Wonka. If it's just Timothy throwing eccentric looks around character actors and CGI, it's not gonna be enough to carry the movie. It looks promising, but for me, I will want more than just an actor acting silly for two hours."
"Me thinks wonka number 2,in the works"
"looks way too Artificial, it insist to be extremely Epic and Magical...
but it just made me roll my eyes

does anyone realy care for Wonkas back story?!"
ROVAN ATIKONSON HOLY SHEEEEEEET
I know it's petty but the American accents ruin this for me :(
It's gonna be a masterpiece 😍 absolutely loved it
Looks like a train wreck can't wait for it to flop 😂😂
No more Ideas in Hollywood! Let's just keep remaking movies! I don't waste my money!
Stop remaking movies
"It's like Disney movie, but without cameo fest that burns your eyes"
"I loved it when willy wonka said, "" we didnt lose the chocolate war, we wonk  it"" and proceeded to wonk his willy. Truly a moment of this trailer"
❤
No one wants this.
"not interested , not a fan of WOnker films. anyway, this guy should be given the chance to try out for Doctor Who.  I think he would do good."
"No Johnny, no Wonka"
I spy Mat Baynton!
That looks pretty bad. Suspecion of disbelieve was shattered almost immediatelly.
If Im HONEST I predict Timothy Chalamet performance as Wonka will be better than the actual movie tbh. But we will see.
"I have no desire to watch this movie but I really really appreciate the fact that this trailer doesn't start with a 5 second mini trailer and feature some girl singing ""Pure Imagination"" with vocal fry."
Timmy future oscar winner his role selection is 10/10
i love  Timothée Chalamet but he is not good for this character who knows he may surprise us
"They actually got the classic oompa loompa look right, something the last movie failed to do 😤"
It’s meh
NUH UH
Grandpa Joe is a scumbag
It feels weird to see an ethnically diverse Willy Wonka movie. It’s like we’re in an alternate universe.
I can't imagine anyone as wonka other than depp.
Is there a CGI animators strike going on that I don't know about?
"No just no, absolutely not"
"As someone who read the book and saw the original film, I’m super excited for this 🔥🔥🔥"
"Wow, It feels like a new CATCF movie I’m gonna see but better☺️"
1:41 Rowan Atkinson
I wonder if we'll get to see how Wonka met Mr. Wilkinson?
for rowan atkinson
Puts smile on my face 😊 oh how exciting!
"why did they cast timmothy chalomet for this movie, what were they thinking?"
Ohh brilliant brilliant this is brilliant
Wooooooo
I m loving it Mr. Wonka ❤
"It's been _way_ too long since the last time we've had a whimsical movie being released around Christmas. This is something we could really use. Normally origin movies are 'meh' at best and don't always succeed in the box office but we have a story telling about how everyone's favorite decades old chocolatier came to be. Tim Burton's _Charlie and the Chocolate Factory_ was way more faithful to the novel(s) but only dipped into the past, like how he met the Oopma Loompa tribe and nothing else. By the look of things, _Wonka_ will be giving fans a full tour of how he came to be. Can't wait."
Omg
"I wouldnt say this looks good, but it looks interesting.  I hate how all these movies look like a glitter explosion.  There also seems to be alot of call backs and nostalgia to the Gene Wilder version.  I understand that Wilder is the standard but I like to see some more originality.  Just because it was a catchy line in the first movie doesn't mean you have to repeat it.  I'm not as excited as others here but at least nothing can tarnish the magic of the original as Gene Wilder will always be my Wonka."
"The guy from Dune is now willy wonka without a shop... Ever watched Guy Pierce films??? My life 😭 (wonka didn't have a shop, he had a factory, and Hugh Laurie will serve me like Santa's elf for goodness sake 😋😇🫒)"
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe.
"""no daydreaming""  😭😄"
"hmm i dont know why everyone is so hype about this movie. For me, i dont really see willy wonka vibe in this movie. But it's just a trailer so... hope the movie will show us better!"
Who is Hugh Grant?
Oh wait they ruined it....😢 Wheres jhonny depp and the stereotypes came back...
The woke wanka 😮😮😮
i didn't know what to expect from this film but it looks really funny
They could have made a movie called Wanka and Mark Ruffalo could have played himself
GRATE ENGENUATAY
This looks wonderful. I can't wait.
timothee nasil bu kadar guzel bir oyuncu olabiliyor ya 🥺
"Okay, the 1970's movie was silly, but down to earth. This just looks super childish."
"Stop!  Just stop!  Get somebody who has an original-goddam idea, and hire them. Stop remaking remakes over and over you no talent hacks."
Oh this looks fun
"This looks really good, can't wait to see it."
producer of harry potter?
"After the flash fail in the box office. WB really need a W, if not BARBIE then Willy Wonka"
"OK , This just might be Good !"
"What if Peter Ostrum played a young Grandpa Joe in this, it would really go full circle."
I was literally thinking of Wonka 😂
"Никто: 
Всё ещё никто: 
Русскоговорящие: ЖОПКААА!!!"
Ya la quiero ver
The trend of creatively bankrupt rehashes continues. I do like the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa though.
I hope it does not go tooo much against Roald Dahls orginal  vision for Willy Wonka.
WTFF
"Disappointed. But hey it's got those diversity quotas met. Which is the main thing 😊. The story itself looks very childish, I know it's a kid's movie but it could have some better wit to it. Looks boring, overly soppy and Wonka seems to be played without the wit or mischief the original had. The only saving grace is Hugh Grant, though I doubt he can save this."
1:28 So they've made Hitler ginger?
Who up wonking they willy rn
Rowan Atkinson (Mr. Bean) casted as Wonka looks incredible
"I'd be dirt poor if I had been fined for all the daydreaming I've done.


Also, more than 10,000 people across the world have watched this in a minute for more than 50 minutes!♥️"
Not bad. What's next?
I came expecting to be like “why do they have to try and remake a classic and ruin it again?” But I like the story this appears to telling.
timothee is fabulous
Ohhhh.  This looks good!
Why?
No shot.
Who’s the leader of the Chocolate Cartel? El Chaco?
looks BAD... except for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. The rest looks absymal.
"Okey now i'm excited, thought this would be a 3rd remake at first but i was wrong big time."
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa! Legendary!
Hopefully he doesnt make a peach flavoured chocolate
"I don’t know, it looks pretty dull. 
I do like Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa…the rest (including the main Wonka actor) are meh. 😒"
It's Chocolate Time 😅
I'm sorry this looks extremely dumb and the writing is corny
Now that is an oompa loompa. Not some weird little indian guy but orange skin and green hair as they should look.
I'm sorry being honest here this is extremely woke.
Johnny depp. Is perfect for Willy Wonka
absolutely not
I didn’t know i needed this movie until now
"hmm, love Timmy but does his acting feels like he’s acting 😭"
"Do you have an appointment?



Oh wrong film"
"Ah, so this is 'Fantastic (Cocoa) Beans And Where To Find Them,' then. Got it."
"""Here we go Mama."""
Omg it's Wonka's backstory 😮.
Finally we learn his origin story
"Hollywood has run out of ideas for new movies so they keep remaking the old ones and westerns are the worst, finding ways to use Shane to find things to put in their movies."
"Going to watch only for Rowan Atkinson.
Still cant beat the charm of Previous OG ."
ЖОПКА!
Oompa Loompas are back
More like Willy Wanka.
This looks Amazing just from the Trailer Alone I can see the Beautiful Cinematography!!
I’m ready for the Willy Wonka: Into the Wonkaverse. Need that Johnny Depp and 2pac’d Gene Wilder action
I actually did something I never have done before. I fast forward the trailer to the end. That’s not good meaning this trailer bored me and I love movies like this. Hope the movie is great tho.
This is the Joker to Charlie and the chocolate factory s Batman.
"You know what, i am surprisingly excited to see this movie, the choice of oompa loompa actor is also quite surprising, but i think it will be funny with the english accent lmao."
Day one.
Course. Diverse as always.
Wow.. timothee is actually good
Can’t wait to see Timmy the Wonka this December 💜🎩👓
Im so glad well see more of willy wonka i mean its been years i need more about him and im so glad this movie is coming out 🎉❤Im so happy who else is?

I had no idea this was a thing and I’m excited
OMG.
The year of Timothee
"You’ve got big shoes to fill Tim, good luck!"
Waiting for hindi trailer❤❤❤
he's not weird enough
"If there is Rowan Atkinson, then it is a much watch"
"And yet they find another way to ruin original movies 

there is no reason why this movie should exist"
Looks great !
The Chocolate Cartel 💀💀
Dropiado
"With how masterful paddington 2 is, definitely checking this one out!"
Wow that looks TERRIBLE
Hopefully they bring back Wonka bars because of this movie
"I am sorry but i didn’t get crazy, insane creepy Willy Wonka vibe that we got from Johnny depp in the chrlie and chocolate factory. When they say timothee will play Wonka i thought that it was the best decision. But now ,i am only speaking on trailer, it’s just looks like he is playing as a normal young man without any excitement and surprising features. His acting look so boring against the character he’s playing."
The choose the wrong actor
I love the surrealness of the movie. I can't wait
nice
This looks like to won’t be good . Compared to previous movies. Timothy Chalamet was a terrible pick for this
🤢
yea im gonna watch this
That films is WONKA-tasic but...oompa loompa meme did a kracc bacc create a chocolate factory and inventor chocolate remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factory...DO THE HORROR VERSION PLZ!!!!!!
This is so beautiful and I am going to see this in theaters
Heart
okay that seems like a waste
WHY
Awesome can’t wait
I see a lot of ireng people
Vaya vamos a ver como va la película
Now do one with Otho from Beetlejuice!!
Oh wow Timothee twink is killing it!
It's going to classic
omaaaguueedddddddds!!!!!!!
Definitely better than Depp. We’ll see how close he comes to the original Gene
Skeptical....but I'll give it a shot.
So there's the woke culture
Se ve bien y siempre se antoja ver algo interesante en época navideña
A Willy Wonka prequel series why? 😭
I’m so happy that Willy wonka is coming back
Woke 🤢
Who's here for Mr Grant?
"I like the director and the cast looks great but... this looks really unneccesary, and a bit underwhelming.  Do we really need to know Willy Wonkas back story?"
"""You have a responsibility to take care of these people."" Immediately fires them all for slave labor and becomes a curmudgeon."
I wanna be a Legend too 😢
"This actually looks amazing, can't wait to watch it!"
Ok... this looks great 😊
"Timothee Chalamet looks like a worthy successor (or predecessor?) of Gene Wilder's top hat, and I will definitely be seeing this! ❤"
I thought his fuzzy lifting stuff was experimental years from then.
"I swear Hollywood doesn't have the ability to do anything original or new !??
I am just shocked theh haven't turned Wonka into a Black Female."
"ngl i genuinely thought this was going to be a creepier film ... like this was his villain origin story or something . he starts off with a passion for chocolate, the trauma from his upbringing / his father in the back of his mind and not completely resolved ... and then he gets in deeper and deeper and begins to enslave oompa loompas and starts to put children's lives in danger. but this seems like a very fun family christmas film :-)"
My childhood. Well with this my Christmas gonna be special ❤
I wonder when Hollywood will stop making the same movie over and over?
Hiiii carson
"“How do you like it? White? Dark? Nutty? Absolutely Insane?”


Me: Yes."
Perfect actor for the part of Wonka.   I so look forward to this.
I’m watching the heck out of this come the Christmas months
YESSSSSSSS!
Why isn't Wonka black?
This is going to be a great movie
No one can replace jhony deep
Why is he so young
yes.
Timothee booked and busy 😭this and Dune 2 are both coming out this year
"He looks like Gene Wilder
The best wonka movie"
He remaineds me of Johnny Depp from Charli and the chocolate factory (JD) all time favourite actor
"SO glad they chose Timotheé Charlamet instead of Tom Holland. No offense to Tom, but Timotheé is a MUCH better fit for this character and role."
"I am not feeling this at all, very disappointed. I had more faith in Timothée to pull something off, but this come across as quite boring, and mundane."
There's a lot of over a hype here. Let's come back down to reality and wait for it to come out.
I’m sorry all I see is Daniel Thrasher
something for the family....that's cute.
Danny devito as an oompa luumpa or I'm out
"This kid isn't a good actor, least not in this. It's like he is just saying the lines without putting himself in the role. Hugh looks funny. Love it!"
They got the right actor for Wonka!
Mais il est partout Chalamet :D
I’m over the same three actors being cast for everything
not a Timothée Chalamet fan but he’s going to be great in this
i think this roll would definettely fitt on thimmy like wonka's personality lokks kinda same as themothe's personnality                                                   and i'm extreamelly happy because i can't wait for Dune so this one would come just after one month                                                                              and i just wanna get sure of something cause in this minute1:50 is thimmy the same littel boy in Badington and he grow up to be Wonka ?
I think it would be really interesting to see how he chooses his successor. That would make a really interesting movie

"This trailer managed to convince me that Willy Wonka did enroll into Hogwarts, but he had decided to quit school and become a chocolatier😅."
Sorry this just looks bad
nope...hard pass...He is not believable for one second as Wonka
"It might be good, but will it beat Paddington 2?"
Timotheé Chamalet Warner Bros Poster Boy 2023. DUNE 2 a few months before.
DID I SEE ROWAN ATKINSON OR AM I TRIPPING
Is no one gonna talk about Mr Bean cameo?
Please stop with the remakes nobody will ever be out do Gene Wilder
"Of all the Wonka movies out there, this is one of them"
This looks awfulll😮
"Willy Wonka and the chocolate eye. Thx god Ezra Miller is no Wonka this time, not that hard to imagine what would he do with them little kids on his factory."
Tbh it does look very much like it’s for kids. It could be good but yeah the trailer is giving me catered to a young audience vibe which I guess is what Charlie and the chocolate factory is but let’s be honest little kids aren’t gonna care about a Willy Wonka origin story…
жопка
thats too much fantasy
Johny is johny nobody can replace him
Looks like trash I’m sorry
"Boy, I miss Gene Wilder."
Bro in this role just reminds me of Daniel Thrasher but less charismatic.
This looks absolutely amazing!!!! I can't wait to see this movie ❤
What the heck? Wasn't the original one with a boy? Why did they change that character? If they wanted to do this version. Maybe make Wonka a female of coIor too. Warner Brothers should rename their company to W0K3 Brothers. This is not original. They are swapping characters for their poIiticaI views like Disney did with the Mermaid and Peter Pan which were both fIops.
Willy Wonka would be tasked to make chemical weapons for world governments if this was real
Just lovely ❤
Let this be a prequel to Johnny Depp’s Willy wonka
Beautiful!🍬🍭🍫
This movie should’ve never been made…..
I am so invested in this movie!!!!
If Johnny Depp does not make a cameo I am not watching it.
willi wonka and the chocolate factory
Another Mr wokka. i hope is  Chocolate Factory again
Who the frick wants a black girls as a main character.
And I am officially excited for this movie.
Looks like everyone in that movie had a lot of fun making it
They better get this right.....
Next big flop?

"This is absolutely ridiculous!
This is a Willy Wonka for ""modern audience"" with the perfect ""diversity quotas"" % to improve ""inclusion"" and the commun sense and good story you just throw that in the trash 🗑️
I don't expect anything from this and I already know how well it will do in the box office."
"Timothée was amazing in Call Me By Your Name but feels like he's getting worse and worse.

He completely lacks the eccentricity required to play a role like Wonka. It's like watching a high school drama student."
"Another movie no one asked for. Another super production, extra exaggerated, to take you to the theaters and be forgotten forever after 1 month."
Chalamet definitely channels Gene Wilder. Perfect!
The cringe is strong with this one
So when does he build a Train to survive the end of the world?
Dude has the most punchable face in the universe.
"Confucius says

Moving backwards is not moving at all."
He plays a amazing young Gene Wilder!
The actor is so great!
Who up Wonka they Willy? 💯‼️
"Not getting Christmas vibes from it though.😅
Will watch only if its non woke."
Did i just see Rowan Atkinson as a Priest 😂
I heard the twist is that the entire movie is a spice dream and the credits roll right into Dune 2
Boring.
This looks not that great
Prime Kino
I LOVE IT
"I've always told myself that I liked both movie adaptations because of their duality: Wilder's is simple and straightforward with it's plot and magic, while Depp's is more mysterious, mystical, and macabre.
Since they confirmed this will be prequeling Gene Wilder's adaptation, I'm looking forward to seeing that mystery and extravagance I felt from Depp's and more for Wilder's universe."
Johnny Depp is the best Willy Wonka
That looks like Harley from MLBB
This looks like Dolittle with Robert Downey jr
"This movie looks good, but the OG Author of the book said that he hated the Original Film so much that he wouldn't let anyone make any movies until he died. That's why the remake was made 15 years after his death. So if you're gonna watch this movie, remember that the OG Author is doesn't want it to exist"
Rowan Atkinson is toxic in real life. Why cast him in this otherwise fantastical movie.
"Couldnt they cast real ""small"" actors for the loompas? I mean hugh grant is a fine actor but cmon enough with the CGI."
Please stop this. The first two times were enough.
No matter what anyone says Willy wonka would never be the same as Johnny depp played but still giving timothy a chance for redemption
We need Jhonny Depp back . 🏴‍☠️
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is hilarious and pretty well acted btw.
Gotta love this orchestral version of Gene Wilder's Pure Imagination from the original movie
Warner Bros must hate money. Why keep remaking the same movie over and over and over and over and over and over and over again?
"I heard this movie was “unwatchable” in early screenings, but holy cow!

What is this overtly whimsical horse pup?? Is this a prequel to the Gene Wilder film??? Cuz this trailer doesn’t resemble it in the slightest, yet it’s pawning off my memories in cheap one-liners and references. So who was this for?? Children???

Also everyone praising Timmy C in this trailer is on drugs. 

I am both confused and embarrassed."
This actually looks good. Wow. I've gotta see this when it comes out.
I’m liking the whimsical energy of this
"I'm so torn because it looks great! But I just wish that we could get some more original pieces instead of never-ending cinematic universes and remakes, retcons, and reimaginings. Can we ever just leave well enough alone?"
SO EXCITED
Whhhaaa….Is this going to be….good? Did the good folks at Warner just get their “Harry Potter” extended universe?!
Let's just hope this version of Willy Wonka does not have a dentist as a father
Looks terrible
2:18 = jajajaja is very funny 😅
I personally don't think timothee was a good pick he doesn't give me Wonka vibes at all and his voice is to raspy while the film looks good doesn't match with the og movie or to Johnny's wonka
stoooopid
Not again.
"Such a shame, Keegan and Rowan Atkinson but its a childrens movie, Ill miss it."
i can't wait
"Is Wonka supposed to be American? I always imagined him to be British since it’s a classic British book. 🧐

I mean, America doesn’t know how to make classic, sweet, milky chocolate. It’s all bitter."
"When I heard Willy Wonka,I can only imagine Johnny Depp"
Depp is still the best.
👏👏👏 there going with gene wilder version
Wokea
you gotta be kidding me
If they don't sell Wonka chocolate 😅
"Если все такие толерантные ,где азиаты, мексиканцы, индийцы, индейцы?"
It look like it’s gonna be good
Timothee is truly one of the most brilliant young actors of this generation. The phenomenal range he has!
Extravagant production!! Can't wait!
Seriously looks like nobody asked for this movie. We already had two great wonka movies
Omg can't wait
Average....

Im not sure Timothee has that warmth that gene wilder had. Maybe hes more of a Johnny depp Wonka
"Idk just from this trailer alone, i don't think this has something to do with charlie and the chocolate factory starring johnny depp. cause wonka here? is waayy less unhinged it's like two completely different person 😂"
omg the guy from horrible histories!!
I don’t know about this.
"Cant wait for this I love Charlie and the chocolate factory films 
Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 
Charlie and the chocolate factory 2005 
Wonka 2023"
STOP WITH THESE GODDAME REMAKES!
Who asked for this?!
Сразу скажу это провал года!!!
"it must be on the wishlist, a happy and beautiful film, very suitable to watch with family on Christmas and New Year holidays ❤ 🎉 🤗"
To unleash the chocolate jihaad. That is my terrible purpose...
you had me at paddington
This looks good
Glad the oompa loompas look the same as the original.
now this is how you make a prequel. so excited for the movie they even have my fav actors hugh grant and rowan atkinson playing comical characters! this is going to be so good like they really captured the magical wonder of the story without the tone seeming too fake or awkward
Love from Asia hit like here✨
"Jesus, black people are everywhere now, I'm sick of this"
I was iffy about it until they showed Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. Loved that part.
I was 💯 NOPE until Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa.
The Hugh Grant casting is a thing of genius 😂
Isso parece incrível! Estou animado.
"I can’t wait to hear Timothy sing! I hope he has a good singing voice, this looks like a great musical just from the dancing teases"
I’m so excited grew up watching the original Willy Wonka can’t wait to see this one it looks really good
Can't wait for the part where Wonka goes 'Its Wonkin time!'.
So excited for this ❤
No
"After a long wait, finally"
Nice to see that snowpiercer is getting a prequel
How he meet the little men🤔
Is it just me or I saw Mr been running around. 😭
"""He's good. Too Good."""
This kid is not a movie star. Sorry. Dune is mediocre. This looks terrible.
Where's Charlie?😢
Huhuhhuhuhuhuhuhuuhhuhuhuh
"Looks good, please don't butcher another childhood movie franchise"
I loved Johnny as this character but I’ll give this a go looks good
"Kinda wondering if they left out the ""edge"" that the original had for the trailer, or if it's not in the film at all."
Hugh Grant as Oompa loompa sounds like Stewie from Family Guy
yes
Trailers not great but seeing that the paddington director is behind this gives me hope.
AAAAAHHHHHH
Can't wait to see that.
I have always loved Willy Wonka and Im so happy we will get to see an expansion of his character and story😊
"i saw the thumbnail and said ""oh no D:"" out loud"
Seems a bit too young but oh well. I can't wait for the next movie where he tortures and kills all those kids in his chocolate factory lmao
01:02 is that Rowan Atkinson???
wasn't he a massive recluse who hated everyone?
LMAO TİMOTHEE AS WONKA?
"Oh my goodness I can’t wait!!
I love movies so much!

I want to be a movie director when I grow up.
I can’t wait to help create the worlds of fantasy. In a way, I’d get to live in the magic worlds by making them. Yes no?"
Forced and weak
I just screamed “Mr.Bean”❤..can’t wait for this…
Swapped Charlie with a baboon 😂
Lol Hugh grant
This movie looks amazing. Timothée Chalamet is a great actor and this new kind of role looks amazing.
Imagine that the end that he meet Litlle Charlie bucket before the factory tour.
Shweet
yooo
This is the movie I needed. The prequel I never knew I needed
So MlD 😂
Who asked for this?
"Anyone else very sceptical about the first look at Timothy’s performance in this?  

I am gauging that he doesn’t have the acting maturity to match up to the depth required for this role  and especially to match his Wonka predecessors. 

I’m worried he won’t be able to make us care about this character as well as pull off the whimsical nature required to do the role justice. 

Whereas Jean and Johnny both naturally had these traits and thus were perfectly cast. This film depends even more on an a perfect casting for Wonka, given that Wonka is the sole driving force of the film.

I love Timothy in his other roles and understand why he is so popular atm, but i think his popularity is the only reason he’s been cast for the role, not because he was the most appropriate actor. 

I hope I’m proven wrong. If not it’s another example of Hollywood ruining another treasured franchise for a quick buck."
Stupid
incredible fr
"Going off visuals looks like it’s leaning towards the Original while having a bit of Tim Burton’s moodiness 

I’m interested"
"“The suspense is terrible, I hope it’ll last.” - Willy Wonka 🍫"
I absolutely need to watch this!!!!
I will keep an open mind but I'm a little concereed I must say
Look we all know Gene was the best. But this looks interesting and I’m more than willing to give it a shot.
And then DeviantArt artists just showed up...
AKA Fantastic Fudge and Where to Find It
It's too woke.
So many memories.
Something I never thought I wanna see! And I still dont.
man bad casting is a recurring theme these days
chocolate must be a euphemism for psychoactive chemicals
Bruh I don't wanna see this Timothy in every movie man wtf
3rd remake? But why?
This looks amazing. I’m watching this in imax when it comes out
What I love about his performance is that you can see little bits of Gene Wilder in there
"Yay! Now we can all finally get the untold story of how a renegade wizard and burgeoning serial killer somehow evaded the detection of the ministry of magic while fighting a war against the cartels in his area by making better ""candy"" then them."
Wasnt sure if i was sold with this but seeing hugh grant as an oompa loompa i now NEED to see it
"It's nice and inclusive and diverse to have the young black woman as his sidekick. No worries about your DEI score on this one. 
The picture looks interesting."
The only reason I want to watch this is for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa. That is the only part of this movie that looks entertaining to me.
жопка
I can see my inner child getting excited 😮I remember watching the old movie when I was little all the time
I try to think what Gene Wilder would have said if he watched this trailer. I think he would have been delighted to see someone like Mr. Chalamet playing a younger version of wonka.
this looks like a mistake lol
Жопка
Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa is so cursed in the best way possible
"My favourite part was when he said ""it's Wonking time"", and he Wonked all over the place."
omg mathew baynton. yippeeing so hard rn
Another Wonka movie??? Hollywood is definitely running out of original ideas.
I like how people have stopped acting stupid and are now willing to accept a new actor playing Willy Wonka.
This is a world of pure imagination
omg
Someone please tag Michael Scott 😂
I’m not sure what I just watched.
This looks absolutely amazing and I can't wait to watch it❤ even better that it comes out at Christmas ❤
"This is more like it... This is how you want to see Timothee, as the good guy  Not a monster as he was in Bones and All which I refuse to watch.  but I am looking foreword to Dune 2 and Wonka  looks like it will be a Timmy Holiday season this year!"
OMMMG HUGH GRANT AS OOMPA LOOMPA
"""No body Can beat JHONNY DEPP act like"""
MATTHEW 😊
"no disrespect to tim, but no one can beat depp."
"My favorite movie is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilde, sorry to say but depp didn’t do him justice, this looks VERY promising 🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫🍫"
No need for this remake.  It can’t possibly top the original. How dare these Hollywood clown taint a perfect movie
"WOW WOW WOW, the movie Wonka looks great (I love Johnny Depp's version ❤) but this new version has a fresh and youthful air

 It will surely be spectacular to see it, the musical scenes and how Willy Wonka opened the chocolate factory 🍫🍫🍫 .  But the best thing is Timothy Chalomett's performance will surely break it so I'm really looking forward to seeing this movie

 PS = the oompa loompa looks identical to the oompa loompas from the 1971 movie so both movies are connected 😃"
''From the Director of Paddington'' - ooooh we're in for a ride my boi!
Jonka
"So excited for this! Honestly the thumbnail is pretty weak and timothée’s look compared to Johnny depp’s wonka looked so plain that I did judge it before actually watching the trailer I admit but this is gonna be so good! I mean they’ve got some really great actors. Even timothée’s acting seems really promising, the way his wonka is erratic but not completely unhinged surprisingly works. Totally looking forward to this. And the oompa loompa bit is gonna be hilarious I just know it"
"Waste of time, money and relevance… next!!!"
Oh my god mr bean my idol
Willy Woka? Gene Wilder was the only Willy Wonka... Let's just hope Warner has learned from Disney's mistakes...
Mr beeaan
NOT HUGH GRANT BEING AN OOMPA LOOMPA!!!
"Johnny Depp as a Wonka was amazing 
❤. I like the young Wonka Timothee as well."
I am just excited to hear the oompa loompas sing.
Can no-one else sense the low quality of this big budget film? ESG ratings have destroyed everything.
Why tho..
Is that Mathew Baynton?!?! From Horrible Histories?!?! And Yonderland?!? And Ghosts?!?
"Wonka? 
WHAT HAPPENED TO WILLY?!?!"
"Please, for the love of God, stop casting timothee Chalamet in everything.  I actually like him as a person but he has no on-screen charisma imo.  Should stick to smaller indie films"
"Another flop

How and when did cinema fall so hard, so fast?

Maybe it's the feminized male lead

Maybe it's the poor casting

I dunno but it's bad"
"I was unsure about this...but directed by the same director as Paddington, and an unexpected Hugh Grant-as-an-oompa-loompa has sold me. Plus, I like Timothee."
"Remove the charm, add CGI. This will be a great strategy!"
Looks fun and inspiring! ❤
😂😂😂 Oh ffs make an original movie already
OH MY GOD!!!!!
i can wait for this the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Gene Wilder will always be my Willy Wonka ❤😊
Dont fumble the bag wb!!
Okay which one of you asked for this?
terrible
It looks way more childish then I expected but will still be seated
Hmm Timothy doesnt convince me as Wonka (i've only seen the trailer so maybe i'll change my mind after seeing the movie). Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is great though 😂
Wow! I want to vomit.
"My word! I'm SO excited for this. Timothee, you absolute rockstar."
"Might wanna lay off the Spice, Paul."
Why is there Jurassic Park music cue's in this?😂
"Gene Wilder was the goat, this dude doesn't have that weird quirkiness..."
This looks TERRIBLE!
Wow
Looks very cute! Can't wait to see it :3
Been waiting for this for too long
mmmmmm I'm not a fan. This looks boring and just a movie for children.
Finally an Origin story of The Classic Willy Wonka Gene Wilder loved that one growing up especially the Oompa Loompas!!!
Call me skeptical. Timothy Chalamet  has impressed me in his other stuff but I’m not seeing Willy Wonka here. I hope I’m wrong.
Wish they called it willy
The good wonka
"Based on the previous movies he became miserable right?
Will something bad happen to that girl at the end of that movie?"
Well. Not for me
"I’m not thoroughly convinced with Timothee’s performance from the trailer alone. But I love the director of Paddington, Sally Hawkins, Olivia Colman, and particularly Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is an inspired choice but also not surprising given how incredible he was in Paddington 2."
"T.C. looks unexpectedly miscast. He's normally natural on screen but looks like he's ""acting"" here."
who up wonking they willy rn
mathew baynton❤
This is so bad. Please stop with these remakes and sequels. Do something new
Oh no...
they should some how give credit to johnny depp by exploring into future or something
OMG IM SO EXCITED
"This will be as rememberable as Robert Downey, Jr.‘s Dr. Dolittle"
This is the second best day ever. The first will be the day it releases in theaters
This will be a very promising Christmas present! :3
Still has nothing on the original.Looks like wonka gets lost in fantastic beasts or Harry Potter.
Жопка 😂
hum.....chocolate may cause willie wonka hallucinations O.o
"Into the WonkaVerse
Interesting to see a prequel as we saw that in 2005 Johnny Depp version."
Sucessor of Jonny Depp.
Wife and kid saw this in an early screening.  Wife was surprised how good it was.
cool
Amazing I love this I just wonder if this is a backstory???? Amazing job!!!❤❤❤❤
"Not a fan of Timothy, but another Wonka story? Meh. Alright. I'll wait till it's streaming, I guess. 😂"
Wow the music was phenomenal. Hearing Pure Imagination like that brought back a lot of memories. Excited for this!!
1:41 run away🔥
I forgot about this lol
didn't need this. Make new stories.
"and just as I thought we were safe, there he is, Hugh f-ing Grant. Here to ruin everything with his over-acted role which is the same in every movie he's in."
"I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS BEING MADE,  SOTHE WAY I LAUGHED WHEN I SAW TIMOTHEE CHALAMET AS WILLY WONKA IN THE THUMBNAIL. NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THE SHOCK"
Oh good lord no. This looks terrible.
I might watch this for the Giraffe.
"why make a prequel while in the first movie, there are flashbacks of Wonka's childhood and journeys. 
I feel puzzled."
"I would love to be his actor
A lot of Chocolate and we needed Mr Bean here"
"I literally have chills, looks so good!"
This looks absolutely dreadful and bland. Sorry but the world doesn’t need yet another Willy wonka movie. Don’t @ me
"It was nice to hear the music from ""Ready Player One"", hope to hear more of how they reworked it:)

Also, the trailer gave me ""Cruella"" vibes. I liked that movie, so let's see how another origin story redeeming a famous psychotic character comes out."
Aaaah is Rowan Atkinson 😘
DING DING DING DING
It's too good
Yeah it's good and all but I will watch for Rowan Atkinson also he Is a legend indeed
Who up wonking they willy
A Peep Show Reunion. I shall be seated
Thank goodness it’s camp & it’s not tooooooooooooo serious
It’s Wonkin Time
Just saw Olivia Colman in The Bear s2 and now here. She never says no to a script and I love her for it ❤
Paul Atreidis decides to sell chocolates
Lets Go...!! After Dune in November we have Willy Wonka in December
"Something i needed but never expected, a fresh movie with mr bean in it."
"He who can destroy a thing, controls chocolate."
THE WONKA IS NOW BACK AFTER 18 YEARS
Visual masterpiece..
*Timothée Chocolatemelt*
Mr wonka where’s th oompa loompas
"I was skeptical before for the trailer, but now I'm totally sold"
TIMOTHY CHALAMET AS WONKA?! PERFECT CASTING
Does anyone saw Rowan Atkinson running?
It’s a no for me
"Incomming ""offended"" people because of the ""white washing"" of the Oompa Loompas (even tho in the original movies they were like that).
Movie looks fun, worth watching in theaters."
"Sorry, not my Wonka."
Now I want a Dune Fudge Bar or something silly
This looks awful
This looks wonderful!!
Am I the only one not buying Timothee in this role? The zaniness feels so forced and unnatural.
"ah, they replaced Tim Burton's Daddy issues Wonka with Make mommy proud Wonka.  Either way, looks very decent and I shall give them my money."
Indian audience ❤
Would have loved to see a cameo from OG Willy Wonka...
No imagination with these studios. The same stories rehashed over and over again. So much creation in the early 1900's. And now it's just rehasing the same thing over and over again. Just sad.
Any movie that has the hutzpah to cop a line from Monty Python is at least worth considering!
this trailer smelled like chocolate to me wow
"WOW the cinematography looks Great. Not sure about the rest, but will give it a chance."
"I think Timothy is a great actor, but this film looks like rubbish. The last remake with Johnny Depp was bad enough. This updated version looks like it wants a shot at that title..."
"Damn, this actually looks great"
watching this for keygan
amo el trailer... será una buena película
Trash
Obnoxious from the first sight :/ There is only one Willy Wonka and he is not this sleazy kid.
Finally a movie with some actual colours
Timotheé Chalamet is the top actor of his generation! ❤
This looks awful. He's over acting. Like...this is a highschool stage production level of acting. 🙄
"I really hope it's not another boring musical, I wonder who will replace the great Knight Christopher Lee"
Johnny Depp is still number one to me.
"Ok,why is this a prequel to the 1971 adaptation. Its deserves its own adaptation outright!"
What a pile of garbage... I can't believe I'm even seeing this..
just watching Mr.bean run confirms it for me that this will be a banger.
"It looks a bit awkward and rough around the edges, but with good intentions, I think. The heartthrob to ooma loompa pipeline is really selling me on this movie."
This may be my first timoththee chamalet movie I see
I want a movie after charlie gets the factory😢😢
You can almost smell the greed! It's not made for any other reason than money!
Oh I need to see this…..
Aren't the Oompa Loompas bigger then that. Also I now more interested in the girl Wonka is with her back story and what happened to her.
Personally I feel Timothée is too hot for this role but that doesn’t mean I won’t watch it 😂
A Willy Wonka Origin Story....does it crossover with Wolverine
We need Jhony depp
"""Жопка"""
Johnson??!! Mark!!?? Johnson!!! Mark!!!!😬
This looks so pointlessly bad
Yes I love this!!!!!
"So, my boy Muad'Dib decided to pour a bit of spice in chocolate business ? interesting .."
The legend himself Rowan Atkinson is in it. I’m gonna watch this movie no matter what
My favorite part was when willy said “it’s wonking time” and wonked all over the place
lil timmy tim!!!
Hollywood listen: This is how you market older classics to “modern audiences” while still paying tribute to what made them loved in the first place.
Timothee's expression in the video somehow reminds me of a young Leonardo DiCaprio.
He does not have the charisma for this role also who’s the token black
"I literally choked on my food when i saw Rowan Atkinson

a surprise to be sure but a welcome one"
Sorry terrible casting
Just make him a wizard and this will all make sense
I don't think I've heard the word chocolate used so many times.
*ЖОПКА*
There it is
Just the most iconic childhood movie coming back in a new form Cannot wait to go to theatre to watch this ❤❤❤❤
Quick question what is gods name is a chocolate cartel
Это прекрасно 🍫✨
ЖОПКА
Jeremy Allen White would have been a better choice
1:42 MR. BEAN😮
This looks amazing
Ofcourse there’s a black girl in it
Tim Chalamet’s great but there’s one Willy Wonka and he goes by the name Gene F*cking Wilder! rip
looks mid
All the American accents in a European setting is very jarring.
Fantastic Sweets and Where to Try Them
Why did I feel so giddy with excitement when Sally Hawkins showed up 😂 can't waitttt for this
I would very much like for this to be a whimsical fantasy adventure and not a devastating psychological thriller like the previous Chocolate Factory movies have been pls and ty xoxo
4K trailer from official publisher appreciation comment ❤

Sttuuupppiiiddddddd
omg i love movies that FEEL like this im so excited christmas and halloween movies make me feel so good on the inside <33
"I don't feel the wackiness coming from Timothee, he's just handsome. This rather seems whack AF"
If you insist on odd diversity why aren’t there any Asians? Just sayin.
"Oh, Mr. Bean speaks!!"
"Not sure how I'm going to feel about CGI oompa loompas, but the rest looks incredibly promising"
"Cinema has gone down hill so quickly, now our beloved childhood memories are being wiped for cooperate greed, RIP childhood!"
Paul Atreides added Spice to his chocolate!
i love timothee 😩
"This year will be Timothee’s finest year. And this new Willy Wonka movie is going to be really amazing and uplifting I can tell. It’s no wonder why Timothee Chalamet was the perfect choice to play Willy Wonka. If Gene Wilder was fantastic, then Timothee will easily follow his footsteps."
I think Rowan Atkinson would have been more compelling Wonka
Anybody here who watched this trailer with a smile on their faces? Im guilty!
"i’m gonna call it now, Charlemagne is miscast  as Wonka. while he is a great dramatic actor, i don’t see him fairing well in this movies tone."
"Sorry, this is not going to work. Hope I am wrong!  I was hoping for a more serious rendition this time."
Nope this ain’t it
"No emotion and none of the eccentricity required to fill Gene Wilder's shoes. Either Timothee Chalamet phoned this one in, or he was never that good of an actor to begin with. No amount of fantastical music and special effects can make up for bad acting."
"Not only did no one ask for this, but no one who likes/ respects the original book/ Gene Wilder film should like this. Plus i'm fairly sure that as much as the book's author hated the original film because of chances, he would like this even less and probably wouldn't let this be made"
Rowan Atkinson!!!!
Это прекрасно 🍫✨
"Yah
Okay
I'll watch that"
this looks so good and entertaining
Once we started we can’t stop🤣
We're doing this again huh?
Abe 300 part -3 banao be ye kya chutiyapa ban rahe ho
This movie has always given me the creeps. I had nightmares as a kid with the old original movie.
The real cinema is back
matthew baynton…im sat
Yo no cambio por nada del mundo a la versión de Johnny Depp
It is not diverse enough as it should be for 19th century England😔
"""Here we go momma..."" **Dune woman starts singing**"
"ура, тот самый Жопка получил ремейк"
"nope, nope, nope."
"This looks so lame. Are there any new stories Jonny Depp wonka, big shoes to fit."
Love the casting and the production design here and I appreciate that shooting on digital saves time and is less expensive to shoot with but it definitely gives the film a cheaply made look compared to the cinematic quality of shooting on 35mm. 'Dial of Destiny' and the 'Fantastic Beasts' movies also had this problem.
Жопка <3

"No…nooooo 😂 I’m sorry. I love Timotheé but Wonka wasn’t making that kind of magical stuff til way later on. If this is his origin story…and his candy was already magical (plus publicly known about) then the kids and adults that visit his factory decades later would not be so in awe and wonder. Also Oompa Loompa are bigger than that. I also can’t place the area or environment and Timotheé slips in and out of character, I don’t think he was being given proper direction…also and last point, if he is in old England, in a majority white nation…where’d he find a black assistant? Did he bring her with him on his travels? Where is she in the future?"
Gene Wilder would say f*** you so this is what's going to happen now we're going to remake all the old movies go ahead it's going to fail like the other Willy Wonka that failed there's only one that's with Gene Wilder have a good day
I miss Johnny Depp!
"Johnson, Alan Johnson!"
"dont like it, gonna watch it"
timothy isn't giving me the charismatic wonka vibes
Woah willy wonka prequel 
"Remake of OG Wonka 😍😍😍 can't wait and the same production of Harry Potter, super excited"
JOHNSON
Really not a fan of the actor that's playing Wonka
I thought this was an AI-generated mock video until I saw Timothy Chalamet actually talk properly ...
The subtitles at the start of the video scared me for a sec lmao.
I’m gonna cry
Oompa Loompas freak me out.
Hugh grant?
A masterpiece knocking on our doors.... can't wait to watch 😍
that girl looks like a inclusivity placement
Johnny Depp was an emotion that no one can replace from this movie I hope he has a cameo in this movie as Timothee Chalamet seems he has done a good job in acting as the grown up Charlie in this movie. Have high hopes from this movie.
WHAT
"People saying he’s nothing like Willy Wonka HE IS, HE IS CLEARLY BASED OF THE TOP G WONKA GENE WILDER HIMSELF"
"I really miss eating Willy Wonka chocolate bars. the last one I ate is called ""Whatchamacallit"""
Huh??
ohhh i missed the oompa loompaasss!!!!!!😂😂😂
This looks dreadful
good old days 😢
Can we see Timothee topless in this? That will be the icing on the chocolate cake! 😊😅😂
Diversity cast again? why they didn't cast a mexican girl? because the chocolate is mexican
"I thought 2023 was a bad year for movies, but things are starting to look up now. Winter 2023 is gonna be a blast with the release of this, and TBOSAS"
This looks like trash
oh to taste without my eyes
Looks pretty bad if you ask me. Not something I'll be watching anytime soon. Enjoy it those of you who do.
I’m so excited to see this movie!!! Willy Wonka’s is one of my favorite characters of all time!!!
Uploaded 46 min ago and 556k views already... seems like people are excited already😂😂
Oh I cannot wait
"We wanted more origin story and we're getting it, I'm not mad"
Oh my god this looks so fun 😭
Can we just get a new movie instead of remaking the old ones?
Willy Wonka loved himself a Chocolate Queen!
some of the writing was cringe but this looks fun
"No this has to be addressed why must there always be Africans shoehorned into every Caucasian film these days!! ENOUGH! Timotheé Chalamet's accent felt off-putting because very used to Johnny Depp, and overall it looks annoying. Rowin Atkinson was nice to see."
flop incoming
"How many very rich people looked at this in pre production looked at this and said ""Ohh yeah this will do good!""? Really boggles the mind"
Is it just me or is tim trying to replicate jhonny depps willy wonka?
masterpiece is way!
Milking it huh? Goodness Hollywood is so unoriginal these days
Hopefully it wont have a bunch of wokewash garbage.
yes.
I thought wonka found oompa loompas by going deep into african woods.
"This is a different type of story, cool 😊"
This is gonna be an AMAZING PREQUEL!
I bet chocolate made by Paul Atreides tastes like spice Melange
Looks great!
"After the barbie movie, I'll see this as well."
"Looks fun, but Wonka as a yank? Nooooooo!"
Did i just see rowan Atkinson running in one of the scenes????!!
I already know that this movie will be one of my comfort movies
AWESOME!!!!! I can't wait!!!!!
This actually looks pretty fun
This looks so bad
"Nothing to see here, just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity. LMAO"
Loving the theatrical performance with a pinch of being extra! P.s. i actually thought him playing Wonka was a joke didn't think this was real 😂
how is Timothée Chalamet in every new movie now?
Jeremy Allen White was ROBBED
Timmy Wonka fr
It looks better than the tim Burton version
Horrible casting for willy wonkla
When Paul Atreides takes to much of the Spice.
I’m seated
Very good I love Willy Wonka so I will definitely watch this 😀
TIMOTHEÉ ILL ALWAYS LAB U YOU’RE AMAZING!!!
was hesitant but i’m sold
This looked good until the Oompa Loompa showed up. I...I think we owe Deep Roy an apology.
NO ME JODAS SE VE LINDISIMA
THE ENDING hahahaha I literally had to pause it to compose myself
This modern remake makes the chocolate taste terrible.
Timothy
Wow this is a truly masterpiece 👏 look's timothee chalamet do a amazing work they give wonderful experience can't waiting to see this in theater's🤩
So AMAZING! Hopefully Warner Bros Discovery don't ruins this!
is that Mr. Bean????

"Already saw that movie when it had Gene Wilder.  Can't imagine this one will be better.  We'll continues skipping these until Hollywood has a creative, original thought."
This looks cute!
"It looks great, but when i think Willy Wonka, i just see Johnny Depp."
"Oh yes, a remake about a monopoly capitalist who keeps free illegal ethnic workers in slave labor without pay"
errrrr..NO!
Ngl I kinda like it
Oh award season will be abuzz!
Love the scenery
"This actor for Willy is absurd, interesting"
Twonka.
White guy saves poor black girl?
Nice 😊 we had a original then a remake 😒we don’t talk about that and now we’re getting a prequel ok I am i love the Willy wonker movies hopefully 🙏 they get this one right ❤
Жопка
I'm really looking forward to this Willy Wonka prequel!
The fact that two parts of my childhood (Willy Wonka in general and Rowan Atkinson/ Mr. Bean) are in this movie makes me want to watch it so badly
Another one!?
"I already know that the „how do you like it - dark, white - nutty?“   part is going to become a TikTok sound 🫠"
"WHERE ARE THE NEGATIVE reviews, WHY ARE YOU FILTERING THE COMMENTS"
Why god why. Hollywood pls just make new stories instead of beating preexisting media to death
"Isn’t it crazy when you go on these trailer videos and you see some of the most braindead and cringe, bizarre comments of all time? If you wanna see how stupid most of the population is, just go to a movie trailer comment section."
This goes off script and doesn't capture the message of the original movie or book. Its intended to teach the audience about bad behavior in children.
"""He who has the power to destroy something has the real control over it"""
"Wow, Timothee Chalamet wasn't lying. This movie is gonna be grade-a awesome! 🤩"
This is going to be TRASH. I gave already given it too much attention by just watching the trailer and I think im done
A whole lot of Paddington in the credits
What is this nonsense?
Я его ждала!!!❤❤❤😘😘😘😘 Обожаю Тимати Шаламе!!!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
"Everyone looks wonderful except for Timothee Chalamet. He just doesn't have that eccentric, insane look like Gene Wilder or Nicholas Cage to be Willy Wonka.  I'm open to a new version but so far what I'm seeing isn't impressive."
good cast's
This movie about to give me cavities.
Wonka ? Where is his willie ?
"so Mary Poppins meets Willy Wonka...
not my demographic, I like the kid but he looks weak in this.
maybe Hugh Grant can save it,"
So he went from this to being a murderous psychopath.
"As a Catholic, seeing Mr Bean as a Priest is an absolute win💪🏾"
I’m over prequels….let’s have movies about the bitter end for our favorite characters
I'll be there no matter what!
Wow it looks great! Well i do miss johnny depp's oompa loompas.
"""Nothing to see here. Just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity."" Lovely! :D"
Жопка 😂
Lame
Looks like billy the kid
why is not willi wonka black :( ?
Why is this perfect!??
I feel like I'm the only one that doesn't like the look of this
So how does he manage to do all this without the dwarves?
could be a fun watch
Another another reboot? But why?
"Padington's a great movie, i'm expecting good show out of this"
It would be amazing if Willy Wonka made his shop in the Uk
He should be the new Edward Scissorhand.
of course there are black main characters in a movie which is set in a time when there were not many black people in london and the black people who lived in london would have little importance or rights. i wish they would keep it real and stop trying to change history.
Well this proves that the studios are out of original ideas!
i hate him sm
this actually looks pretty good! very whimsical..i'll have too check it out!
Look forward to it😁
"""But because of your STUBBORNNESS and your UNREPENTANT HEART, you are storing up WRATH against yourself for the day of God’s wrath, when His RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT will be revealed. God will REPAY each person according to what they have done. To those who by persistence in doing good seek glory, honor and immortality, He will give eternal life. But for those who are SELF-SEEKING and who REJECT THE TRUTH and FOLLOW EVIL, there will be WRATH and ANGER. There will be TROUBLE and DISTRESS for every human being who does EVIL: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile; but glory, honor and peace for everyone who does good: first for the Jew, then for the Gentile. (ROMANS 2:5-10)


""If we say that we have NO sin, we DECEIVE ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is FAITHFUL and JUST to FORGIVE us our sins and to CLEANSE us from all unrighteousness. (1 John 8-9)


""If you openly declare that JESUS is Lord and BELIEVE in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be SAVED*. For it is by believing in your heart that you are made right with GOD, and it is by openly declaring your FAITH that you are saved. As the Scriptures tell us, “Anyone who TRUSTS in Him will never be disgraced.” (Romans 10:9-11)


By God's GRACE ✝️, the gift of SALVATION and ETERNAL LIFE is available to all. You can receive it. You can reject it. May you choose wisely."
"I love it when people starts floating in mid-air just by eating Willy's candy, none of them not even the police reacts horribly. They're like: ""Eh, just another Tuesday""."
So how he get into Evil arc
негров уберите
"I admire timothee for taking up a completely different role to his previous ones.. but I'll be honest, I can't see Wonka as anyone else but Johnny depp"
So is it the origin of the one from the 70s
"No match of Charlie and the chocolate factory, wonka can only be Johny Depp. Hats off to that man, he made wonka, ""WILLY WONKA!❤❤❤"""
Real original Hollywood... 😴
At last someone uploading a film trailer at 4K!!
Is it supposed to be in Wakanda?
What is Ansem the Wise doing here?
"Go woke, go broke"
Another wonka movie.
Dude I saw this guy and I was like my god that is the perfect willy Wonka
Another one again!? Why?
"Timothée is the PERFECT cast for Willy Wonka, no one can say otherwise"
I can hear the music of the Shiloh Dynasty - Pure Imagination song in minute 1:30
First 5 seconds of the trailer and I can already tell he’s gonna play an amazing wonka
Oscar is loading for Timothy
"Holy Cow, this looks good. Is this an original movie or is it prequel to the Gene Wilder movie."
what's paul from dune doing as wonka? bruh.
This trailer makes me want to have a chocolate bar right now 😋.
Cool
Again with the rewriting of history. I thought it was supposed to be set in Victorian Britain? Anything odd about this trailer?
Another boring film loading
SHUT UP! I had a dream about Timothy last night and here he is playing one of the most curious characters from my childhood! ❤❤❤❤❤
I was dubious but I think I’m sold
WHY!
After watching the masterpiece of Johnny in Charlie I feel like Timothy just might do this role justice
HUGH GRANT AS AN OOMPA LOOMPA?? my life is fufilled
Oh I’ve been waiting for this day far too long 🎉
How can you have Mr.bean in the movie and only give him 2 sec of screen time in the trailer ?
oddio tonno cioccolatino
Can’t wait to see timothée chalamet poison a child with candy
"In the original movie, Wonka was whiter and there were no black people. 😅😅😅😅"
Looks like Timothee's Wonka has the humor of Gene Wilder's version and the personality of Johnny Depp's version
"""The chocolate cartel"" 💀"
Oh this looks fun and such a great cast!
im actually kinda shocked and how interested i am in seeing this now lol
"Hugh Grant oompaloompa



bottom text"
This looks so dumb im sorry timmy
Gross!
The suspense is terrible. I hope it will last.
I’m teary eyed when his mum appeared… 😢😢😢😢 this is going to be amazing!
This movie is being made by the same people that made Paddington and harry potter this bout to be good
So Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Harry Potter?
This looks vastly better than I thought it would.
i will love it but make new stories bruh
"Could have saved money using real little people instead of cgi, we get enough from superhero movies"
"After watching the BTS video and anticipating this, we finally have a trailer!!!!"
Not needed nor required but golly gosh does it look splendiferous!
"Now this is something I did not expect. So far, this looks great. I think I found my swan song movie for this year."
L movie.
this made me have an urge to push 50 pounds of bowels out my body
SUICIDE SQUAD ISEKAI > WONKA
"Timothee is amazing in this, I already love it"
"Amazed at how many blacks are in London at this time in history.
Almost like it’s diversity quotas"
"Yikes, this is cringe"
Ummmm wtf is this???
Lol what
I'm glad we're going to dig into how he came to enslave a miniscule foreign people group
"In my humble opinion, Chalamet is not suited for this kind of character, I can see him trying to play, but I still see Chalamet, not Willy Wonka. I don't think this film will even come close to being as good as the original Johnny Depp film. Depp is multi-faceted, I doubt anyone will play Willy Wonka better than him anymore."
No daydreaming or a 3 dollar fine 😂
Woke
TIMOTHÉE CHALAMET OSCAR WINNER
"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
fan girling so harddddd this looks like its gonna be so funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
The best Willy Wonka will always be Johnny Depp.
looks like harry potter from different universe
"i'm a simple man, i saw Rowan Atkinson running and screaming, i put this on the must watch list."
Many years later he met a boy called charlie
how do i know about wonka? thanks to mr beast :)
Soo excited 😆
"Paul Atreides, the Chocolatier.  The Spice Chocolate is my favorite."
"In an alternate universe, Paul Atreides is set to create his own spice factory."
This looks... awful.
this looks fun! im excited for it
How many times can you beat an old horse?
can't wait to wonk my willy to this
A reason to live till December ❤
"It felt like such a missed opportunity to not say ""The Greatest Chocolate Factory"" at 1:57"
"the actor playing wonka doesn't sound that great, but aside from that it looks good"
Why are there so many black people?  Pass.
"Tim looks like a mix of Gene and Johnny, how wonderful"
Why??
This is giving 😍😍😍😍😍
Hollywood just can’t leave stuff alone. Smh.
Yeah... nah... It will probably just live in the shadow of Johnny Depp.
HUGH GRANT IS ADORABLE AS A OOPAH LOOPAH😂
I see Mister Bean 😊
Sweet.
"I wonder if the oompa loompas are going to be slaves, like in the book."
This year's biggest flop.
We want Johnny Depp
Nope.
There are some actors that no matter who they play all I see is the actor and not the character theyre playing
honesty i like this types of movies where you see the Orings of  a certain char  i also like how their going form the original movie
"Gene Wilder will forever be the one true Willy Wonka, Johnny Deep was ok at best."
I clicked on the video because I had a Harry Potter vibe and also thought that the main character might be Daniel Radcliffe but it seriously reminded me of harry potter😊
Wow this looks bad
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND HOW EXCITED I AMMMM
Tbh I didnt like it at all. Ive always like the more misterious version of Willy Wonka. Not the happy guy. But the crazy man thats lonely.
looks soulless AF
why does timothee chalamet look so much like daniel thrasher in this
"I have several thoughts: 
1. Hold up this is real? 
2. 0:28 CARSON?!?!?!?!
3. This looks visually awesome! 
4. Timothee Chalamet is a perfect casting choice! Nobody will match Gene Wilder, but he'll definitely be a great Wonka!
5. Cue Tumblr losing their minds over Timmy as Willy Wonka. 
6. Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompas might be an even more perfect casting choice. 
7. You can really tell the director also directed Paddington, it's got that same grey feel contrasted with the utter whimsy of the story. 
8. Matt Lucas too? I'm watching this in theaters. Congratulations, your advertisement has worked."
"This looks like it would be a poor ""Fantastic Beasts"" spin-off and somehow feels wholly unoriginal."
"Жопка, хехе"
That scumbag Grandpa Joe better not have politicked his way into this movie.
I'm gonna watch this explicitly for the scene of Rowan Atkinson running from a giraffe.
Is that Rowan Atkinson on this movie to?
"Sometimes I'm not a fan of prequels, but I think it'd be cool to see how he got his start becoming the famous chocolate maker we all know. Plus I do like watch timothee chalamet"
"I'll stick with Gene Wilder and real orange midgets, thank you."
"My favorite part is when he said ""Time to wonk my willy!"" and Wonka'd all over the place"
"Paddington is amazing, Nic Cages said it, everyone knows it and this is from the same director?? I'm in."
No thank you! Don’t need a woke lgbtq wonka
"Слишком мало шоколадок. Нужно больше шоколадок. Если вы понимаете, о чем я."
"It looks good now, but like everything nowadays, watch it go from Wonka to ""Woke""a"
Is that Rowan Atkinson at 1:41?
"The fact that this was directed by the same guy who made Paddington Beae, and the fact that this feels like it has the same tone as the OG film, means that this will be an absolute incredible prequel. RIP Gene Wilder."
I think this has potential.
"rowan atkinson , lets goooo"
Alan Johnson 😍
OMG! This actually looks really good! I will definitely be seeing this!
Nope... Not again with the swapping and the woking
Do we really need a 3rd wonka movie??????  Doubtful
Johnny Depp nailed this role.
Another Willie Wonka is not what we asked for or what we need.
"Roald Dahl hated Israel. Doo dah, doo dah"
"So Rowan Atkinson (mr bean) in the movie?
I'm waiting on🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥"
Timothee doesn't have the snap or edge that Depp does
Perfect movie for Christmas time 😇
my Eye saw him as Timothee but my brain started replacing him with Jhonny depp automatically ... what if Jhonny did it once again
Man it's actually seems to be brilliant
I said omg another the child in lost in wonka factory movie gushh...But nope. Smth was missing in this movies and ıt was actually Willy Wonka's life story. Good idea.
I find it funny how wonka keeps getting younger over the years 😂 every movie was a different aged wonka
No.
Willy wonka + mr bean is there!
Wired acting.
"опять куча негров в фильме. это ""разнообразие"" уже утомило."
mr bean ?
MR BEAN?
I'd like it nutty🥜 and peachy🍑 0:21
This makes me miss Depp.
1:53 looks exactly like Gene Wilder
Timothée i doubted you for this one but turns out you are perfect for wonka. He is super talented
How tf is Timothee Chalamet so good at his job?
This looks bad
"I like Timothee, but that’s just not his type of character. It’s just the Trailer, but I’m not sure."
How are y’all not tired of seeing the same stuff over and over… “BUT ITS A PREQUEL!” - everything is becoming tired and worn out. Do we really need another 10 movies like the fast series.
I believe this Willy Wonka Prequel will be a masterpiece. I believe the film and Timothee Chalamet’s performance will rank up there with Gene Wilder’s 1971 masterpiece Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory
Adorable
"Chinese food has MSG,
and Movies have ESG.

It's pretty pitiful how you can now predict how the casting will be controlled to have this ""we serve 1 flavor only: twirl"".
ESG is literally the dystopian flavor police Willy Wonka would be up against, no cap."
Ok sorry but Willy will always be Genes baby
Biggest thing is MATT is in this MATT ON MATT WE LOVE YOU!!!!!!!!!
"I was somewhat interested until ""once we start dancing we can't stop"" then I switched to hooked. Hugh Grant in that tiny scene sold it for me."
NICE
I literally screamed. but still not gonna be as good as Depp
Amazing movie theme
Is that Mr. Bean?
"Whyyyy Actor Johnny Depp 😭😭😭😭😭.. 
Whyyyy WARNER BROSSS??"
still chasing that gene wilder
The Chocolate must flow.
"This is gonna be movie of the year, isn't it"
"Willy Wonka to the Chocolate Cartel: ""May thy knife chip and shatter"""
@warnerbros ❤ #wonka any ticket to wonkalnand ? Just on theater 🍭
"Did Paul Atreides just turn into Gene Wilder?

... Well color me convinced! Let's go watch this!"
after johnny depp this dosent hit the same
Love it!
"DEI is alive and well, i see."
Tim would be wonka
"I thought this was going to be a gritty reboot, kinda disappointed it’s not"
Timothée being an incredible actor again
its wonka'n time
"They're really giving unnecessary backstories for every side character nowadays, huh?"
no johny depp ;(
I love the part where Timothee Chamalet said it's Wonkin time and starts to Wonk his Willy into a peach
Woke-a
"Barbie, Wonka... Warner, I'm poor! Tickets in Brazil are expensive!!!!"
Жопка
I thought it would be a remake from 2005. So wrong I was! 😁
是年輕的瘋帽吧😂
This version of willy Wonka has a bit of the Gene Wilder with a twist
"Awesome Awesome Awesome 💯 superhit....🎉
A double han han😂😂😂
People define Law of gravity 😂"
Got the whole peep show / horrible histories squad haha class set of actors
Wowwwwwwwwwww..... A WILLY WONKA movie... Can’t wait to watch it...
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
"This year!!!! 
Oppenheimer
Barbie
Killers of the flower moon
Napoleon
Dune 2
And now this!!"
"Timothe chalamet give us nothing as always..
He isn’t expressive"
"What an ethnically diverse wonderland they all seem to live in. 
So do you think it's Wonka or the Oompa Loompas that instigate the genocide that must happen before Charlie's story takes place?"
"Oh God! I've missed you, Timothée :)"
damn i love willy wonka
Poor Copy of bollywood movie Dhoom 3 😢
"Gene Wilder would be so proud.

""We are the music makers... And we are the dreamers of dreams..."""
Wow
Why is willy wonka american though
booooo im not watching it . Its trying to copy the originals success at least make it a little orignal
Timothee Chalamet is the Willy Wonka we never knew we needed.
Paul Atreides plays Willy Wonka….I got a mixed feeling about it😂
Why are the only films with any promise in the 2020s the ones with Timothée Chalamet
"I was worried, but then it said from the director of 'Paddington'"
"BROO THE WAY MY JAW DROPPED !! 
I'm so excited to see Timothé playing wonka, let's enjoy it all when it comes out"
Olivia Colman! Sign me up
Looks beautiful and yes absolutely insane 😀 I can not wait
I will stick with Tim Burton...this is too childish.
i like this
Except we didn't need yet another Wonka remake
Christmas time is the perfect time for this to release. Smart thinking WB.
Johnny depp is a must
i wouldn't mind having flight capabilities but how are you supposed to come back down?
Do you think it gets into how he turned from fun loving to not be bothered by children being killed in industrial accidents at his factory?
Atreides Chocolate!
I wonder if Willy Wonka will finally bring good chocolate to America
Full of wonka wokeness and leftie bs
daaamnnn
Charlie and the chocolate factory🏭❤😘
"Yep, I'm watching this. It's gonna be a classic."
Kwisatz Haderachocolate
No hate to this movie but can't someone make something original?
Well...guess I will put this on the theater schedule for Christmas.
Is this a prequel to the original or a prequel to the reboot or a reboot of the reboot?
WHO CARES ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF WILLY WONKA. THE ORIGIN STORY DE-MYSTIFIES THE CHARACTER. DAMN IT HOLLYWOOD STOP THAT
Жопка
"He made cookies. Flavored them with lies. Come on down to Simple Will's.

Seriously tho Paul Atreides and Willy Wonka a month apart. This dudes going sicko mode"
"This movie looks absolutely magical, I never knew I needed a willy wonka prequel but this looks like it’s gonna be a wonderful watch. can’t wait!"
"Thx, feels like I saw the whole movie"
He’s not black? I’m disappointed
"You know someone is going to have a go that you are using hugh grant head on someone with dwarfism , and not the true persons body."
MAKE. SOMETHING. NEW.
give some respect to mr.bean his appearance in trailer is only 2 times what is this
they had to add a black token sidekick for political correctness  XD
Willy wonka prequal with Timothee 's gonna be a lit ❤
This looks so good 😍
come back DEPP!!!
So this is actually supposed to be the Gene Wilder wonka then?
They finally understand the material .. this looks amazing
I hope they make this movie a metaphor for slavery
I screamed when I saw Jim Carter!  Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows of all time 😭
"I.... I don't know if we needed this.

Also, it's always a red flag when a film doesn't trust its predecessors and instead hedges their bets by being self-referential in their humor. The whole oopma loompa scene feels anachronistic."
Wow. This movie seems better than I ever thought it would be! Chalamet is definitely giving me a Gene Wilder vibes. I am definitely buying a tickets to this thing! 😁
"Timothee Chalamet is basically the same character in every movie at this point, he is Johnny Depp 2.0"
Oh no😩
Aah finally the chocolate cartel is brought to light
I CAN'T BELIVE
i dont see keegan anywhere in the trailer but hes third on the casting list?
looks amazing!!
theyre making another one????
It looks nice actually
"I hear they announced Wonka, so excited for this 😊"
ЖОПКА
I think the first came out in the 1980’s correct if um wrong.
I could tell that it's Harry-Potterish from the very beginning only.
This looks like a bad SNL sketch 😂😂😂
"unpopular opinion, I don't think Timmy should've been the one to play that role...it doesn't suit him well"
"The magic, the vibes, the music. It’s all so wonderful. Def won’t be skipping this one"
Hollyweird still out of ideas I see.
Wonka and his poc friend 🙄
"I'm interested, but the whimsy that came so naturally to Gene Wilder feels really...forced with Timothée Chalamet."
"Its interesting and it seems fun and I love Timothee but I don't know how its going to go if they change a lot because there was the original Willy Wonka which I think the old generation(my dad) loved and then there was the one with Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore which I loved but I don't know maybe the new generation will like this one. I cant say for sure, but I hope this goes well. I just find this weird and I only laughed when the guy ran away so I don't know how funny this one will be."
Pass 😂🤣
"This movie is actually shot in Bath, England where I live!!!!"
I might actually go to a theatre for this.
A willy wonka prequel really isn't necessary. The original with Gene Wilder can't be beat. Seems TC is taking inspo from Wilder's willy wonka (probably trying to steer clear from making JD's mistake of trying to completely reimagine willy wonka).
This looks incredible! They definitely chose a good actor for Willy. I can’t wait to see it.
"Oy! What's this then? A bit TOO British innit? It's got that dry, dull feel of Paddington. Can't explain it exactly. Just not my cup of over steeped tea. At least we have the original and at least Burton and JD tried something extra wonky. This feels too bloody safe with dry bri-ish umour."
"Wow! Looks great! Never thought that Timothy Chalamet could be Wonka, but it absolutely fits !"
Big Jingle Jangle vibes!
"I had no expectations at all, but this truly looks good"
He's good. Toooo Good :-)
They'll make this an over-woke version of his story
Stooop( pls don’t ) so many new movies to watch. Yesss
It will be interesting to see how Timothée plays a different mood in this movie
"Was iffy...till the Daydreaming joke, then I knew it could work."
Oh another one
There might be something here
Nice trailer! This only makes me wonder what happened with Wonka's friend
"came here for timothée, staying for hughoompa loompa"
this looks rough… i wish timothee was honestly playing it closer to his normal smug and glum self since i think he would pull that off better. i’m not really interested in seeing him ape depp’s eccentric performance. i also disagree with anyone saying he feels like gene wilder…
"A shame they didn't get Brad Williams, Peter Dinklage, Warwick Davis, etc. for the Oompa Loompas!
(Hardly a shortage of funny little people!)"
This looks amazing
I can't wait to watch this😂🎉
You can't tell me that's not Daniel Thrasher
I’m something of a scientist myself
"Knowing Timothee grew up as a dancer and he finally gets a role to show that off, I’m sooo happy for him."
Whoaa.. can't wait for this one!!. Bakalan pecah ini mah filmnyaa 🍬🍫
So its a prequel to the 70s one?
LETS GOOOOO
"The movie where Jhonny depp was cast as Willy Wonka was about the lottery to lure the children all over the world and experience the world of Chocolate 
This movie seems to be about the Idea and rise of Willy Wonka 
Both are good in their own  perspective!!"
"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received, how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures; and that he was buried, and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures: and that he was seen of Cephas, then of the twelve:
1 Corinthians 15:3‭-‬5 KJV"
"Uhhhhhh This feels like a home run, let’s just hope they stick the Landing."
"I was under the impression that this was a prequel to Johnny Depp’s Wonka, but the fact that the Oompa Loompas are orange means that Timothee is actually playing a young version of Gene Wilder’s Wonka!"
Almost thought they forgotten small humans until end of trailer
Wonka just get ever more handsome as the years pass by!
"Looks good, unfortunately Gene Wilder had this unique genius in restraint that Timothee Chalamet may not be able to carry. Different version of Wonka, I guess! Hope it's good."
Is WB going to make now more and more  2nd part movies of famous movies of 90s.  And also cast Timothee as future replacement of Jhonny Depp. Hope they don't cast him as Jack Sparrow!
I’m surprised they didn’t make Willy Wonka black😂
Carson 
damn this is here and im all for it..
This looks so cute 🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
I’m definitely booking my golden ticket for this show.
This is what WB does best make movies without worrying about franchises keep going WB
"Nothing to see here, indeed. Depressing."
Hollywood try not to remake classic movie with one word title challenge (impossible)
Looks like it’s gonna be flop
why is the oompa loompa already my favorite character after like 10 seconds
Omfg !!! Not again!!
i think im gonna be sick
This looks pretty good!
"I suspect it will be: Willy Woke and the Diverse Factory.  Chalamet is a good actor but I think he's too young for the role. But hey, he had the right woke-sanctioned beginnings so the woke industry opened all the doors to him. Don't blame him, he knows some day, for some stupid lame reason, they will come to cancel him too. That's the Woke Devil's Contract."
Who all expecting a Johnny Depp reference in the movie.
Wow this is lookin' GOOD!
"Wait, I just spotted Rowan Atkinson 1:41"
"Anyone else reminded of the 1971 original, has a strong taste of Gene wilders charm"
1.42 Rowan atkinson
I'm sorry but I hate his voice it's just not wonka-like if you know what I mean it's not magical and full of wonder
It has the classical old English flim with modern twist to it ahhah
mr beeeeeaaannn
This is a lame attempt at trying to capture on an old IP. Stop making reboots and rehashes of the same old garbage. Make something original... if you can....
And with that i will forever see Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa....
To be honest I can only see Timothee Chalamet pretending to be Willy Wonka. I don't feel like seeing Willy Wonka. I don't know if it's because he's not a great actor or just doesn't match the character.
"If Keegan is in a movie, I'll definitely watch it"
I miss J.Depp
Good Remake for sure
This looks great. I cant wait
We doing this again 😩
But then how come we never see his assistant in the later storylines 😳
OHMYGODDDDDDD
"Better than I thought it was gonna be. I like how oompa loompa is a mix of both film versions... appearance of 70s and height of 05. If I recall, the  book version didnt have orange skin or green hair.... though I did read it like 20 odd years ago"
"I don't know, didn't see the ""ECCENTRIC"" in it"
"How many of these movies need to be made, like where the creatively?"
I don’t see this dude becoming the unhinged chocolate man that haunted my nightmares as a kid. Looks good either way!
Bro reminds me of my old primary school teacher
"I will definitely be seeing Rowan Atkinson in this movie, I'm a big fan of him. We only saw him briefly in this trailer."
It looks good but have they just scrapped the original idea or just the start of his origins?
"I hope the movie doesn't end up being... ""wonky"" :)"
"1:40 ""IMMA GIRAFFE!!!"" 🤣🤣🤣"
"No es como la esperaba.....es mucho mejor, se ve espectacular ya quiera verlaaa"
Chills!
Bring in Johnny Depp
Why couldn’t they find a better lead actor?
1:16 is that keegan michael key @_@
I kinda want to give this a chance
Nice feel good movie....we all need this 😊
this movie has an amazing cast from the looks of it
OH MY GOODNESS! I'M LITERALLY SHAKING MY BOOTS! I'M CRYIIIINGGGGGG 😍🔥😭
Is there anything woke about it?
Ok so this looks incredible
This looks so good
"Warner Bros. better be selling Wonka theme chocolates to promote this film. If not, that's a missed opportunity."
"In springtime, the only pretty ring time,. When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding;. Sweet lovers love the spring."
You get fined for daydreaming in this movie? That's not right. Poor Wonka.
Josie my beautiful boy!!!!
"I really dig this vibe, finally someone using an old IP but doing something new"
"Paddington Director?
Oh so this will be peak?"
Who wants a post-credit scene where we see Johnny Deep (Wonka) and Charlie starting their adventure on the glass elevator👌
MR. BEAN!!!!!!!! MISS HIM
Disappointment.
Now why remake the original?
"i thought this would be all dark, but it’s like nice childish and fun like i actually wanna see this"
"I know its just fiction, but seeing black people in victorian era style movies always makes me cringe. Its actually comical how hard Hollywood tries to rewrite history and make it more... ""inclusive"""
I wasn't sold until Hugh Grant showed up as an oompa loompa
i bursted out crying this is not okay
Dune 3 is looking wild.
ugh! stop already. quit messing with our childhood memories please.🤣
AND ON MY BIRTHDAY
"My favourite moment when he said ""It's wonkin' time"""
EYOOOOOO
looks like itll be ok. meh. i like the oompaloompa. i prefer Wonka's backstory to be a mystery.
But he doesn't look weird and that is a big part of willy wonka:/ He looks like a very nice human being. I'll watch it but I don't know if i'm going to believe that he is actually willy wonka.
"""No daydreaming."" 😭"
"I had my doubts but it does look good and my god tha cast though, brilliant! So many amazing actors, one that surprised me the most in that trailer was Mathew Baynton from Ghosts, Yonderland, Horrible Histories, also I read his co-star from those shows, Simon Farnby is also gonna be in it, may have been in the trailer but didn't see him. Also Olivia Colman and Matt Lucas, plus Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa! Just looks awesome!"
"I'm not feeling it.  Bit dated, but can't beat the original"
Warner Bros. fully committed to make flop after flop until bankruptcy
"I heard Paddington, I am all in."
In the score for the trailer you can hear a subtle sample from Pure Imagination 1:30
Wooooowww
So you’re telling me that Willy Wonka went up against the chocolate mafia before he had to create his empire? …. I am so onboard with this
Certain characters are really feeling out of place
boi what de
Does this take place in Africa?
Looks like good family fun!! And another opportunity for Timothy to show his versatility. Hopefully no political junk and just a good holiday film!!
"Man that scene where willy said ""It's wonking time"" and chocolated everyone in the room,, cinema right there."
Finally 😮
Me and my family were in Bath when they were filming the snowy scenes its so cool to see it in the trailer omgg
It’s a no
I dont think Timothe is doing any good here😅
i didn't realize this was the thing i needed for this long
1:17 Keegan-Michael Key is always ways fun to see 👍
"For me, all they needed was a title card reading ""From the director of Paddington."" SOLD!"
"this actually looks really cute and charming? Ok, im interested"
Replace the o with an a
at first was like wait another willy wonka movie? but then realize oh its the orgin of wonka .. we only seen him when he was already famous now we see how he got there .. cant wait to watch!
Looks like garbage
Жопка
Loved this so much .
this could be cool lets wait and watch ig
This should be good
Don't worry everyone. There's enough diversity for it to win Best Picture at the Oscars. Oppenheimer isn't even qualified to be nominated. Easy win!

So a pre-prequel to Snowpiercer? Nice!
"I happened to be in Oxford on the day they were filming a scene. Production meant they had to close the Bodleian Library as well as the streets in front and around.

My main memory of that day is of my girlfriend, infuriated at the minor inconvenience, saying, ""I WILL PUNCH TIMOTHY CHALAMET IN THE FACE."""
Yaasss I am so freaking excited!!!!
Johnny depp is dearly missed😢
Flop
Pog
❤💖🍭🍫🍬
"I don't know why, but I smiled all the way through this 😊"
"Wow, an overacting cringe fest.  Cool"
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
No Daydreaming! 😂
I didn’t know that Willy was a quirked up little twink in his youth but whatever I dig it.
"I hope this movie explains all the future child torture/ endangerment
Lol just kidding 🤣"
Umm... interesting 😳
1800s Britain is looking very ethnic. No thanks.
Who’s the lead role actor?
Hmmmm I’ll reserve judgement. I’m not completely hooked but I bet it’ll be good with the director of Paddington
"I like this Wonka, the only version of WIlly Wonka doesn't feel like creepy man ( Sorry, Johnny Depp's Wonka do feel like a creepy man for me)"
When are they going adapt Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator?
Meh looks ok I guess.
"nah we didnt need it , We already have the best movie stop milking it"
This is amazing. Did i see Rowan Atkinson?
I didn't imagine that could be the prequel to this classic film or the book.
Wasting time and money making these movies nobody wants....
Would love to see a cameo from Freddie Highmore
I don't know if Timothy Chalamet can compete with Johny Depp's Willy Wonka. Timothy is a great actor don't get me wrong here. But Johny set the bar too high for this one. Just my opinion though.
"I can’t get past the fact that every time Timothy speaks, he sounds like he’s reading a story to a group of five year olds."
The whimsicality of everything in this trailer. I think I like it!
é musical
WOAH
Nice a prequal atleast we'll finnaly know how hé started everything before killing 4 kids and hold one his dark legacy
Why? why ruin such a great film by making this sad excuse of a remake??? this made me cringe......
Oh good another remake. Seems like the Writer's Strike has changed nothing.
¿Qué ya no pueden escribir un guion original?
"Oom-pa Loom-pa dopade do
I’ve got a good felling about this, do you?"
"since this is not a tim burton modern nightmare, this already is a W"
"Mr. Wonka, what's the secret behind your magical chocolates? 

A little bit of the spice melange is all it take m'dear."
I Miss the Johhny wonka
Gonna flop
Wonka's father was not a dentist?...meh
❤
Love the fact the opening notes sound exactly the same as the jurassic park trailers....
Will there be a Blueberry inflation scene in this film?
I love this! I wonder if it will make any reference to burton's wonka. Im glad this takes after the first wonka movie but both versions stay deep hard of people's memories
"Here we go, mama"
Eh.... everyting looks pretty good if not really good but... plot wise (from what I got in the trailer) and Timothee Chalamet as Wonka isn't doing it for me. It's all really meh.
oohh i love this already!!!
Is that Alan Johnson there
Жопка
"I thought it would just be a pointless remake, but a prequel?! It looks really good and I am excited for its release!"
Nothing can beat Jhonny Depps version of Willy Wonka
Amazing 👏👏👏
@pjexplained @flickverse
Hi
We need a chocolate brand named Wonka RIGHT NOW!
I just have a feeling this film will be beautiful because just this short trailer captured the magic and joy of the willy wonka and I can't wait to see it!!
Idk if that's Timothy's natural voice but I just love his accent in this movie.
Ewww
Look like shite
Imagine if they put effort into a new movie idea instead of re-doing all of the old ones.
"Well done Timothee, staying with a more natual accent (to you) instead of a bad imitation."
"This looks surprisingly not bad, and Chalamet looks like he's having a surprising amount of fun doing it."
This is gonna be a great theory
I’ll give this a shot
Mr bean
Time to wonk my Willy
Really not very excited for this prequel.. maybe my time is over too see these sort of movies.. n more importantly Mr johny Depp is someone who put something in Ur heart that u won't be able to accept anyone playing his role
"After spending 2 year with brits
Wanka isn't the same word it used to be"
captain jack sparrow as willy wonka is unreplaceable
Again black woke
"This looks so formulaic... Ah yes, believe in yourself and don't give up on your dreams. Revolutionary."
Rowan Atkinson just came out of nowhere 😅
😧
The continuity problems are bothering me
not again
oh my… oh my..
I was like Hugh Grant!? Where!? Did I miss him.. (shows up at end video) … oh… ohhhhhh… oh!? 😅
Literally smiling from ear to ear with this. It’s my favourite childhood book movie on them all. Can’t wait !!!!
This is just Paul Atreides' dream whenever he hit them spices
The trailer showed the whole movie. I hate such trailers.
I want. A . SEQUEL….
Looks like it made for 10yr olds
I wanna see this even though i am in my 30s i love the first Willy Wonka since i was 5
Кто-то должен это начать. ЖОПКА! 😂
Why make this? Not dark enough for my taste.
Dark? White? Nutty?
let is goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
"An origin about Willy Wonka? Huh, neat."
Hollwood running out of ideas kind of frustrating..making same movies over and over again
I didn't know how much I wanted to see hugh grant as the oompa loompas
Hugh Grant. wtf 😂
Paul Atreides and the Chocolate Factory
this sucks dudes.
Why are they trying to tiktok-ify every movie nowadays ☠️☠️☠️
"Chocolate dealer in the streets, Kwisatz Haderach in the sheets."
"Yeah, this is seriously going to hit the emotional sweet spot for me. Pun intended."
Timothèe is trying to so hard to come across as curious and eccentric but he is not nailing it
"Literally, no one asked for this."
Didn’t know *THIS* would come out today! Pretty hyped to see this Wonka dude’s origin story…in scrumdiddlyumptious IMAX!
❤❤❤❤❤
give a double HAAAAA
nooo Tim Wonka is not secy
"What a way to have this trailer first thing on my feed😂.... I deserved to see this  hehe
😎✨
Pretty excited to seee this 👀"
Umm yes 😌💜 also Hugh Grant always accepts the weirdest roles now and I’m living for it 😫💜 I love that man soooo much 😭😭😭
Can someone explain why Hollywood think the world is just black and white? Where are all the other ethnic groups? Why boast diversity when they only accept one other group?
"Жопка.
(Just a random joke in cyrillic)"
I'm so excited to see Willy Wonka promoting diabetes!
Is it considered offensive to cast midgets as oompa lumpas now? We gota have freaky CG body now?
Oh man I’m actually super ready
"I really hope the embarrassingly sappy music isn't part of the actual score.  It's a total misfire, total mismatch."
I see that the molestation of Roald Dahl continues
Mr Carsonnnnnn!
"""not that many black people were present in that time period""

there are people flying, pink clouds, and a tiny red skinned person in the trailer and the first thing that comes to your mind is ""black people do not deserve to be in FANTASY movies"""
Trash
This looks magical!
Movies will continue to flop lmao
Willy Wonka you enslaver
1 min in and its already a big NO. Johnny Depp was better and movie studios were too in that time.
Np plz
Mr. Bean be like: RUN AWAY!!!! 
Willy wonka and the chocolate factory prequel!
I was hoping for a more grounded movie I think? But this looks pretty decent and High Grant as an oompa loompa is pretty next level casting
"how dare you let this tiktok twerp play such a classic and beloved character, you morons vindicate the worst most shallow young people now, why don't you get selena gomez to play gilda? thankyou for making me an angrier person"
I loved when he said: It's wonkin time
I’m just glad they didn’t make Wonka black
I saw Mr. Bean 😂
"Movie usher: Can i help you?

Me: Yes, 2 tickets to see Wonka, one large popcorn. One large Mt. DEW, 1 hotdog, and a bag sour skittles.

Usher: Here you go, enjoy the movie. 

Me: You dame right 😄😄"
Weird? Did anyone ask for this?
This actually looks good
ah
"Oh, this is going to be fun!"
Hey!!!! so excited for this!!!
Wowww❤❤
"Gene Wilder, Christopher Lee and Johnny Depp's career all are rolling in their graves."
The same director of Paddington!
When a movie gets rebooted for a second or third time. Is that a reboot or a tri-boot?
I've got to see this. It looks amazing.
*Lollipops*
My dream is to atleast get a taste  of Wonka chocolate 🍫
At least this movie is going with a different angle - more towards an origin story. Looks interesting!
oh i'm ready for the most magical Christmas ever!
"I actually thought this was Charlie And The Chocolate Factory but with a different title. But now with this trailer, I see its a prequel to Wonka’s success. I hope they create Charlie And The Chocolate Factory after this."
Pass. Gene Wilder we miss you
"so... they are remaking the oompa loompas?? combining theyr original colors with the ""modern"" times. Also, at least now we know that his mother was alive when he was young and was on his side, or meaby they are just erasing his father"
Oh No
Goood!
So they replaced Charlie with a girl named Charlene
Wonka showing the general public magic powers goes against why he was a mysterious man. Takes the magic away of the film.
"My favorite oompa was when the loompa said ""doobadee doo"" and proceeded to oompa all over the loompa"
"They got Mr Bean in it, I'm defiantly watching."
Watching Timothee Chalamet in this with Dune Pt. 2 fresh in the back of my head will be a doozy.
His Willy is gone
It's weird they didnt cast a black female for protagonist
"This man dated the daughter of the actor who last played Willy Wonka, and now he played the same character."
This is a prequel to the iconic charlie and the chocolate factory released in 2005 i think.
Can we not get some new characters? Why do we need another adaptation? STOP!
Is that that timmy-guy from the sand movies?
"Isn't that Atkinson as a priest ?! 
Solid casts !!"
¿Güat? 😮🌟🤗🍫🍓🍬🍭 1:46 💭 uno
The moment  I hear chocolate cartel and I'm invested
loving the cinematics and theatrical acting in this one already 👌
Why is charlie not in it?
timmy looks so good omg
ngl. Timothée Chalamet kinda looks like Daniel Thrasher to me. especially in this role.
I am so excited for all of the nostalgia but i am also worried that this might be too much of a kids movie
270 views
I don't think timothee can't do it😢
warner brothers making the 3rd charlie and the chocolate factory
🎵Come With Me And You'll Be In A World Of Pure Imagination🎵
I love this year❤️
"As long as we don't see grandpa Joe in any capacity, this movie is gonna rock...😅😂😂😂"
Nothing beats the Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp
Tim burton will be proud
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS!!!!🤯🤯🤯🤪🤪🤪🍭🍬🍫🍭🍬🍫🍭🍬🍫 it should've said from the team behind Paddington and the producer of the witches and Matilda the Musical.
Well i never knew i needed this movie before i watched this trailer. Im hyped.
"This looks imaginative, as a movie based upon a Roald Dahl book should be!"
"This film seemed to be following me around at one point. I went to Lyme Regis and they were filming on the Cobb, then I went to Bath and they were filming there too. There was a lot of fake snow involved"
Nice.
Looks awful
Did that oompa loompa played that og flute tune
"I dunno ... why do we have to keep revisiting classics. The original is a masterpiece as it is, I don't need a prequel or sequels. Come up with a unique story line to amaze us like those did back in the day."
This is a thing i never expected in a 100 years.
This movie is confirmed to be a prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (1971). I am ten times more excited for this movie than ever.
"Thought it would be like a darker PG-13 film, not sure how I feel about this."
I…I don’t know what to even say about the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa…other than I can’t look away.
"No, just no"
First movie where this dude doesn't have a resting poker sad face
Sadly not feeling it from the trailer.
all these prequels and sequels are overused and outdated atp. that being said I will be watching this in theatre
Mr. Cacao Bean!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1
Thank god wonka not black...
just glad we're getting more
What will Johnny Depp & the other cast from the 2006 film think about this?
"Обожаю этот фильм! 

Жопка!"
"When I saw the thumbnail, I thought at first it was one of those Wes Anderson AI meme videos."
Жопка
Woke asf
"Well, this looks awful"
This trailer looks awesome!! And I would’ve never expected hugh grant as the Oompa Loompas but I’m here for it!
Wtf
Willy Wonka is a wizard. That explains a lot.
Wowww
Mr. Bean
In a world where chocolate was a competition and freedom was never an option of imagination there lived one person that had the power of magic that made the most brilliant confectionery that everyone can have fun and play
Oh come on! This looks fantastic!
Who let Ziggy out of prison?
Woodrow Wilson? Willy Wonka? Walter White? You got me.
Johnny Depp as Wonka
Where is the oompa loompas people??
white savior? or does he just like little girls that are the color of chocolate
I Still wish that a Charlie and the great glass elevator movie would be made.
This trailer was way better than I was expecting.
Yes!!!
Willy Wonka is like the James Bond of kids films. He gets a new face every few years.
oh jeez😬
Looks like its a musical.
Wow
Mr bean😂❤
Im sorry but it looks lame and superficial...
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
black business owners pre 60s sure
can't wait for this!
*WOПКА* ахах
Brilliant 👌❤🎉And Hugh Grant ????
Kardashian curse big flop incoming
:( where jhonny
Anything better than that atrocity with Johnny Depp.
There is no stopping an oompa loompa when he is about to sing
Am I the only one who feels like Timothee isn’t a good fit for this role?
"I am CRYING, SCREAMING!!  I CANNOT WAIT!!!!!!!!!!"
"lol in the first few seconds I watched this trailer I was like, I am getting Wonka meets Harry Potter vibes and then the trailer told me its made by the Harry Potter Producers and I am like, and there it is =) It looks visually beautiful I am not sure what I think but willing to give it a shot."

looks like a funny ride for christmas
I’m so excited this just turned my mood completely up
Almost thought this was fake
I hope this trailer will be seen with Wish which is the new Disney Animation that comes out November 22.
I'm not gonna watch this.
Didn't know Britain was so ethnically diverse back then...
Rowan Atkinson is also in the movie and that's hilarious! 🤣
Sugary Goodness 🤪🤤😋!
I’m watching this purely for the fact that Alan Johnson (peep show) is in it 😂
"Idk why, but this made me tear up🥹🥹"
oh damn Timmy finally gotta do some actual acting lol
I want johnny depp become to cameo of this movie.
Did they only have one set to film on?
Everything except a JHonny Depp wannabe Timothy Looks perfect.
Depp
PEOPLE WILL ONLY WATCH THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF ROWAN ATKINSON CYKA
AHHHH I CAN'T WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE TO BE IN THEATERS <3
"This looks fantastic. Trailer sparked my interest that I didn't have before about this movie.

I also got taste for milk chocolate."
WHAT A CAST!
"I feel like since it's directed by the person who did Paddington, it's not going to be good. I really don't get people who say Paddington is a good reference.. how ??"
Ommgggg YESSSSSS!
"Another musical with less soul than the original, no thanks. Hollywood is out of ideas. 😂😂😂😂😂😂"
amazing
This mans acting as Willy Wonka is abysmal and does not fit one bit.
"I want to bring my entire family to see this movie on the Cinema, I LOVE WILLY WONKA FOREVER!"
did i just saw rowan atkinson ?
where's Johnny?
Harry potter kidhar hai
Seems like Rowan Atkinson is either ignored or wasted in this classic!
*ЖОПКА* 😂
"Wow, what a trailer cut😍💥"
Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa and Rowan Atkinson small role as a priest is just brilliant 😂
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING EVERYONE STAY CALM
"I like Timothy Chalamet but not buying him in this role, like at all - lol.  Seems forced, at least from the trailer."
Mr. Wonka Is Back.
Mr Bean let’s gooo!!!!!!
Was that Mr bean?
If there's no blueberry inflation we riot at dawn.
Looks fun! Something I think we all need right now
Won't waste money on this drivel.
"my therapist: ""Willy Winka prequel doesn`t exist."" Willy Wonka prequel:"
why can't wonka be a transgendered african American? This movie should be cancelled
I couldn’t imagine anyone else but Timothee playing young Willy wonka 🥺
This looks really GOOD !
A willy wonka prequel is unexpected
Ridiculous. No need for anymore Wonka films.
They aren't doing the true origin of the Oompa Loompa's from the first printing of the book. It's not an accurate adaptation.
Not a huge fan of wonka casting but imo mr bean and huge grant will be the highlight of the show and i m all ready for that this looks good
"Finally, after a few years of waiting since it was announced, we have the trailer and release date."
I never liked Charlie and the chocolate factory.
Gene Wilder is Wonka.
mat baynton mat baynton mat baynton ❤
Og comment 🎉
Look At Little final destination Jr Really Good
"When I grew up, watching huge films in the cinema like Harry Potter, Lord of the Rings... I remember this overwhelming sense of emotion after watching the film... as if a whole generation has just taught me something extremely important within the story-telling.
I would leave the cinema deep in thought and it would genuinely contribute to my development as a human.
I feel like this has been missed in many films these days and I just have a good feeling that this will bring that same experience back to me.

I will 100% watch this in the cinema. Looking forward to it."
timothy chaomellete
I loved the part when Wonka said “It’s Wonking time!!!”
"Looks pretty bad, sick and tired of black people getting crammed into everything."
It’s Wonka Time. Sent chills down my spine. The prequel to dune we didn't know we needed...
I cant tell if this is supposed to be London or Wakanda?
This is without a doubt one of the best trailers I've ever seen!!I've been wondering when we'd see a new Wonka movie!!
Honestly think this is the worst actor ever. I've tried watching his movies and I just can't. Something sinister about this guy either way his movies are awful it's way to early for this remake he has no chance against Jonny Dept performance
It feels like watching Fantastic Beasts trailer 😅❤
Rowan Atkinson ❣❣
Wow❤❤
Just what no one asked for another Wonka movie.
"Naaaa not better than Johnny Depp's Willy wonka 😢
not gonna watch it😅"
Who up wonkin their willy?
Жопка❤
Wonka never been hotter
mr bean in the house
"I’m glad they using the original Willy Wonka in this movie, I mean it was the original, even if I preferred the 2005 film"
Wow let’s repackage another great movie for the second time 🙄
"2 Timmy movies this year, what more could you wish for.."
"I was just in a Willy Wonka Jr. play and now they’re doing a movie, THIS I PS GONNA BE AWSOMWWE 💞💞💞💞"
"Well, it’s not Gene Wilder- but he’ll eventually become him if the Oompa Loompa design is any indication.

Well, anything is better than the Tim Burton adaptation"
"Ah, yes, another movie involving Willy Wonka!"
It would be great to have Johnny Depp make an appearance in this movie.
Can’t wait!😊
So shines a good deed in a weary world
"I wanna cry. This is so beautiful. Reminded me of my childhood, the good ol' days!!!"
I'm excited for this movie
Bunch of unoriginal assclowns making these movies LMAO
Im surprised they didn't make willy Wonka a black female.
The Usul Muad'Dib if Leto Atreides wasn't murdered.
"Me: We don’t need a back ground story of every classic! 

Also me: I need to see this!"
Whhhhhy?!!!!
Gene wilder mixed with Johnny depp
"That is looking sssssssooooo much better than I was expecting! Oh my, the best Willy Wonka to be :)"
Looks so promising
Am I just not fit for this world anymore? All these comments praising this & that was one of the worst trailers I've ever seen. This is barely better than the trsiler for Cats
Hollywood can't do anything original anymore. They just can't.
Getting more Depp vibes than Wilder vibes. But who knows.
Mr. Beannnn
Can we go a year without remakes we did not need this
Please stop.
I can't wait for this to bomb.
The chocolate is spiced
Timothy looks a lot like Gene Wilder aka the Willy Wonka from 1971 in this
"Nahh Timothee couldn't really carry out the character of Woka,  Jhonny was undoubtedly the best"
I think this actually looks really good. I just don't understand the Oompa Loompas size.
This is the kind of movie magic we need back!
ЖОПКА)
R.I.P Gene Wilder
This looks kinda horrible. Timothée Chalamet is clearly a miscast.
Do we REALLY need this?
Why this look good lmao
Fresh breath of air.
bean !!!
Nope.
"Its gone from Willy Wonka, to Michael jackson, to Justin Bieber in ""I feel Funny"""
"OMG, I don't know who's more excited, me or my son lol Probably me!!"
R u all right? Or r u all left?
This...actually looks good? A musical based on Wonka is a great choice
Did i happen to see Mr Bean 😅
willy wonka goes viral
Kinda wish they would've used an actual dwarf for Oompa Loompas. I'm slowly getting Chalamated out. The dude is everywhere
Really hope Johnny Depp likes this
"Wow, Timothee was spectacularly bad as Willy Wonka.  What's what about??"
Let's talk about Rowan Atkinson
Why the forced black girl. Smh every single movie just has to force diversity. Every single one lol
Um... I mean I don't want to judge this movie too harshly before it came out but who thought a Willy Wonka origin story was a good idea?
Surprising how nobody's talking about Johnny Depp😢
Who knew a Willy Wonka prequel would look this good?
"01:02 MR. BEAN 😂
01:41 MR. BEAN 😅"
This actually looks really fun. The director of Paddington always seems to know what he’s doing
Oh ffs why do you have to force black people into a classic...
I have to wait until Christmas???😭(ofc i’ll still watch it)
who wonking they willy rn
Omg looks insanely bad. What.
Ummmm so this whole universe has been magic?
Even just that single shot of Sally Hawkins made me tear up. Here's hoping Paul King is able to bring just as much magic and whimsy to this film as he did to the Paddington movies!
Who let Paul Atreides cook 💀
I have seen a lot of people waiting for this one  but it's looks nice :)
What Willy wonka is this? Is this the young gene wilder or the young Johnny depp one?
"I was skeptical that Timothee Chalamet could pull off a quirky character like Wonka, and I'm still not convinced."
"If you're familar with that famous blooper from the original film, I wonder if any kids will be hit underneath the chin in this film."
The kid in me really wants to watch this!
Better than johnny depp
I really want this to be good I really do
ok the oompa loompa sold it
WAS THAT MR BEAN?!
ЖОПКА❤
This is going be bad.
Why ? Bruh
Yeah this is gonna be huge I smell a trilogy
Perfect opportunity for representation in this story. ;)
This is more like it. 👌 Wasn't a fan of the remake but this prequel looks fun.
Super duper awesome trailer. Can’t wait. Love you Timmy 🤩🤩🤩
1:41 is that Rowan Atkinson!?!?!???
"How do you like it,
Dark, white, nutty, Insane...!😂"
Gene Wilder made the best chocolate.
Fantastica ya quiero verla timothée es un gran actor
0:05 he said the thing
charlie and the chocolat factory X fantastic beasts
"Man, DUNE Part 2 looking straight fire bro"
It's Wonkin' time
They got Charlie's mom from Charlie and the chocolate factory to cameo??
"As you can see, Noble House of Atrides start with very low beginning but they never , ever stop ""dreaming"""
One Of The Best Willy Wonka Prequel
This film looks to delightful not to watch especially when you have the man you bought us Paddington directing with a cast this stacked.
Paddington
This looks awful. Sadly.
Wow so they’ve ruined  my childhood again brilliant
Definitely taking the christmas fam to watch this!!
1:02 wait a minute?
Жопка
I think this movie will beat Warner's Aquaman 2 unless it gets rescheduled (again). It seems like a more family Christmas premiere than Arthur Curry's troubled sequel (even though I enjoyed the first installment in 2018).
Feels out of the concept.
"How does this seem like a completely different story, but it still feels within the same world"
Timothy usually has a wide range of facial expressions but in this one he seems to simply reading the script.
"I like the scene when Will Wonka says ""Its Wonking time."""
CRYING
"Wow, Timothee this is amazing🤩 I can’t wait!!!!"
"He doesn't have the charisma, but the visuals look interesting."
Who up wonking they willy rn?
Chances of the greatest Wonka ever Johnny Depp appearing?
"“Here we go, mama.” So not only will I be seated in theaters on Christmas Day but I will also be an absolute wreck in theaters on Christmas Day ❤"
"Ok, the pre-make (that’s prequel & remake) fatigue is starting to set in…"
Rosen Atkinson and Hugh grant!
looks good but maybe cause I didn't have any expectations
It looks fun
"Love the ""chocolate cartel"" concept."
Wow.
Loving it already 🤩
Rowan Atkinson?! Yeeeees!
Wish I had 4 hands so I could give this 4 thumbs down.
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
What about Johnny Depp they could atleast give him a good scene
looks stupid and woke
Why do I feel like it's Timothée Chalamet pretending to be Willy Wonka ?
Why is Willy Wonka a 17 year old
Chalamet is the perfect choice ❤❤
DANG IT!! FINE ILL WATCH THE MOVIE..
Timothy has to be the worst casting for Willy Wonka of all time. Sounds like an amateur actor in this.
"I would like to like this but, I’m so tired of remakes, it’s lazy and a lack of artistic vision, there’s millions of stories out there to tell."
I'm gonna tell my children this was Dune part 2
This looks like a cinematic wonder!
Wasn’t this going to be a musical!?
His voice just isn't cutting it.
This is what happens when theater kids get a green light
"this was an emotional rollercoaster, i can't wait for this one, this year is about to be NOSTALGIC!"
Another flop in coming 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂 Hollywoke still can't come up with fresh innovative ideas lmao
"They could've changed his hairstyle at least. It's the same in all movies. A bowl cut would've been nicer, like Johny depp's version"
Focusing on a young Willy Wonka and how he came to meet the Oompa-Loompas on one of his earliest adventures.
The WWCU is getting pretty wild
Жопка😂
It looks good but something feels off.
"Okay, I was skeptical, but there might be something to this movie. Getting the director of Paddington was the right move."
No one can beat Johnny depp's Willy Wonka tho
this better be prequel to Charlie and Chocolate factory not Willy Wonka and Slavery Factory
Damn the new Dune trailer looks crazy
I could cry tears of joy 🎉
Didn't realize there were so many black people in early 20th Century England.  Especially in Scotland Yard.
From the director of the GREATEST film of all time…Paddington 2!
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD WHAT
I went into this fully NOT on board. Now I'm on board.
THIS LOOKS HARD 🔥🔥💯💯💯
I can already tell Mr Beast will create a feastable to sponsor the wonka movie
Please please please make this a good one WB 😭
The oompa's are going to steal the show.
This movie will be definitely to little Tim Burton'ish
ngl this dude got a british face
I hopefully it’s not a musical
This is way better than I ever expected
The only Willy Wonka i remember is Johnny Depp
no way the oompa loompa did the ice spice emote
This movie already looks magical
I didn’t know rowan atkinson (aka:mr bean) in this movie 😭
Well that looks dumb
1:40 ROWAN ATKINSON????
"You can just FEEL all the damn Green screen, my GOD WHY"
Chalamet fits perfectly for this role
"Me Sees Wonka Trailer: who would want to watch that?
Me Sees from the director of Paddington: I would want to watch that!"
yeah this is gonna be amazing
"I'm sorry, the people behind this are part of both Paddington AND Harry Potter? Oh there's no damn way this movie isn't being a Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes lol"
Is this based on a true story
I can't believe they're making a prequel to Snowpiercer!
Oh it's gonna be bad.. and I'm not gonna miss this train wreck
"From the trailer: the mood, atmosphere and acting are too different from Tim Burton's original film. It seems more like a fairy tale for children with a primitive storyline. Tim's was more complex and with a unique style. We'll see, but for now I don't want to see the gloomy Wonka turn into Paddington."
"*""they've all been crushed by the chocolate cartel""*"
They had me at the chocolate mafia
"My God, this looks unbearable."
Nope. It's not as good as it was. It's not bad either I think.
Another live action remake!
Why do I get this weird Feeling this Movie isn’t gonna be that good 🤨
great
"The fact that this was directed by the same guy who made Paddington Bear, and the fact that this feels like it has the same tone as the OG film, means that this will be an absolute incredible prequel. RIP Gene Wilder"
No thanks.
Im interested in the chocolate cartel
Nah this ain’t it. Gene Wilder spoiled us all
Haters mad that they can't experience child-like Whimsy
no
"please kill me this is the only thing i wanted , my life’s purpose is fulfilled now 😊"
Timothee fits good as Willy Wonka ngl.
"i thought it was gonna say ""how willy became silly"""
"Sally Hawkins need more recognition, love her as an actress. Also good to see Jim Carter, Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant."
Woke and Cringe
IM SO EXCITED
"The casting is good for the most part, but there's problems. It appears the flick is yet another that will fail because if's trying to send a message instead of trying to tell a satisfying story."
Produced by Diabetes!!
So this is not the story of Charlie Bucket. This is now Willy Wonka’s story.
here we go let’s name the title of the movie the last name of the main character
Yes he’s finally back
"You know I was feeling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory needed a prequel.
Now we have one in works, hyped"
my childhood heart is healed
I like the part where Wonka puts a pinch of spice melange into a chocolate recipe and he has a vision of leading the Oompa Loompas on a genocidal Jihad across the known universe.
No one can match Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka ❤
Yes black people everywhere in 19th century england
Timothee is so hot!!
i LOVEEEE timothee but let the original lie! no more wonkas!
ANOTHER ONE!?

"Leaked wonka concept images in 2018 , filming began in 2021 and now an official trailer in 2023. I don't know how people are just now finding out about this."
This finna be LIT!!
Hugh Grant deserves an oscar
Exited 🤎
Now this looks good! 🍬
Let's go!!!!
This kinda reminds me of Charlie and the chocolate factory🤡
Its just me or theres no volume?😭
This film will hit but Johnny depp's Willy Wonka will be always remembered
Nobody asked for this. Nobody wants this.
im going to vomit.
Dude! I love the willy wonka movies growing up. I can't wait to see this one.
I feared for it...and now I WANT TO SEE IT. Timothée appears to be perfectly cast!
the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Johnny Depp Cameo???
"Rowan Atkinson?!

Bruh"
"This is coming out at a perfect time for the holiday season! Made by people with great track records, a solid cast, plus it's always good to see Rowan Atkinson involved! Whether it comes together well remains to be seen, but it looks to be an interesting prequel and the trailer did it's job well!"
Let's go!!!!@
"Никто:
Русские: ахахаха Жопка)))"
"Yeah, no, this is attached to neither Chocolate Factory movie. Not the second outing since the Oompa Loompas didn't have orange skin, and definitely not the original since Willi Wonka specifically stated that he brought the Oompa Loompas there. But yet, it appears as if one of them just.....finds him???"
"""He's good. Too good."" Yup. I agree. Can't wait till Christmas!"
"looks WOKE. Go Woke, Go Broke."
yippee
The ONLY reason I'd watch this is to see Hugh grant as an Oompa loompa 😂
"come with me and you'll see in a world of pure imagination  Take a look and you'll see
Into your imagination"
Excited!
Roald Dhal and Gene Wildman have just rolled over! 🤦‍♂️
"So glad its a prequel to the 1971 film, I'm not a fan of the 2005 version"
"Please, no. Just no. 👎🏻"
Can’t wait
LIFE STORY OF WILLY WONKA Before the chocolate factory whats Next Wizard of Oz just call it Oz 😂
lookslike am watching a disney movie in warner bros production
I’m just happy to see an Oompa Loompa
Damn I don't expect someone like Hugh grant is oompa loompa
MR BEAN THE VICAR LOL
We need more of the OG Score !!!!
Yeah I’m definitely going to see this
Okay but Timothee is perfect for the role of Willy Wonka
Oopa loompa
This looks so joyous! Im in!
"Timothée Chalamet went from a dark batman-like spaceman to a mickey mouse chocolate maker, in the same year."
Hugh Grant as OOmpa Loompa is a great addition.
Johnson from Peep Show being in this is clearly the main draw
"А вот и трейлер ""ЖОПКИ"" подъехал! Ставим лайк за ""Жопку""!))"
Wanka
Nice  flm
Here's another reason to keep living until the end of the year
My Willy Wonka is always Johnny Depp ❤
"This seems like a really interesting movie!
But uh, I'm kinda confused, how would Wonka even change their lives..?"
This looks terrible
😂 he don't have that wonka energy
who’s willin their wonkers right now after watching this trailer?
Rowan Atkinson 😍
the oompa loompa is more believable than the amount of blacks in the fictional London. Hard pass on this movie
It look so weird…i love it!
Not everything has to be Timothy Shallamay
Run away favourite part on this trailer
doompety doo...!!
Жопка
Looks wholesome!
It’ll be pretty cool if they have Charlie’s grandpa be a side character or even just make a brief cameo
"so what happens to the girl then, he ditches her in the future? Makes no sense, and neither does the mother storyline"
is that mr bean!!!! ahhhhhhhh
this actually looks amazing
Oh my Godddddd😭😭😭
Rowan Atkinson and Olivin  colman  wow nice castings
excited asf omg
"Timothy Chalamet is an incredible actor, so I don't know why this feels so off"
Hollywood can’t come up with something original to save their life. Just endless rape of old IPs. Can’t wait for prequel sequel #37! Member berries are heroin for creatively bankrupt studios.
Omg this is real?  Im gonna crazy whit this omg 😭😭😭😭 Wonka is back im so excited 😭😭😭😭😭😭
"I loved it when Wonka said ""With great chocolate comes great responsibility"" truly the most movie moment ever made"
I am more excited about the fact there's Rowan Atkinson and Key in this movie..
Since we’ve never gotten a Willy Wonka/Charlie Bucket sequel I’m kinda down for prequel. I’m curious to see how Willy Wonka got started
Timothée Chalamet playing Wonka is all I need in life
Wonkanda.
Miss Johnny Depp😍❤️
😴😴😴😴😴😴
"It's ""STRIKE that, reverse it"". They couldn't even get THAT right...🙄"
This is nowhere near as quirky as it thinks it is
ew why him
Looks incredibly mid
WAIT ROWAN IS IN THE FILM TOO?
What I want from the original....is that Wonka had a bit of a sadistic side. Also less cgi....
"Which universe is this supposed to be in? Gene wilder, Johnny depp or the book?"
Who up wonkin they willy??
"Uh oh. I can already tell, Rowan is gonna be the only good factor about this movie."
This looks absolutely amazing and wonderful! Need more Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa! 😂
I mean it looks alright
This looks bad
Mr.Bean!!!
This actually looks pretty good I may just have to go to the theater for the first time since 2018 to go see it.
Can't wait to hear what the songs sound like
I can't wait for the rest of the WCU: the Wonka Cinematic Universe
Honestly I wasn’t gonna pay any attention to this (assuming it was just another cheap forced Hollywood reboot) but I must say my interest has definitely been peaked. Let’s see what this has to offer.
"You had my curiosity. But NOW?

_you have my vested interest_"
❤❤❤Johnny depp is the best willy wonka. ❤❤❤😢😢😢my favorite Johnny depp❤❤❤
he should have been an non-binary POC this is unacceptable
looks good
"Pft, so fake, everyone knows chocolate doesnt make you fly.




Mushrooms do that."
"I loved when he said it's Wonking time and he pulled out his Willy Wonka and wonked everywhere

Truly a riveting experience."
Love seeing Rowan making a nod to monthy pyton
Yay a Rowan Atkinson movie!
i never knew we would see a prequel to willy wonka im quite excited
I dont think this kid fit for this role. It just feels like he's  trying so hard to be funny and energetic.
Thank you WB Youre the best
Phenomenal😂
Still am missing Johnny Depp
"So Willy Wonka meets Mary Poppins, a combination I never knew I needed!!"
1:03 Rowan Atkinson
"Damn, there's something to be said about the power of a good trailer.

I wasn't really looking forward to this movie. But whether it's the whimsical tone, the lively production design, or Chalamet's surprisingly good performance (I knew the guy was a terrific actor, but I figured a role with such an iconic precedent would be difficult to follow up), I'm quite excited by this film now"
Lol Rowan Atkinson at 1:41
I wont be watching this since this ACTOR says JK Rowling is a transphobia. And he calls everyone TERFS if they support her by playing Hogwart's Legacy.
Primer comentario en español 😅
lmao Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa.
Cant wait to watch Wonka !
this actually looks good
That explains everything why spies came after wonkas secrete recipe for great chocolate the chocolate cartel. . . Wait😑
"I clicked this 100% prepared to click back out partway through [Chalamet's current oversaturation everywhere; studios choosing the cheap creepy factor over creativity, etc]...but this looks super fun - sign me up!"
Hoping we see Wonka enslave all the Oompa Loompas
"I dont understand why hollywood cant make new stories anymore , its aaaall about a prequel then a sequel  then a show in the last years.. its sad."
"Loved it when he said ""It's Wonka Time""!"
"I don't know why it is seen as so offensive to portray the Oompa Loompa as per the original material. That is, some variant of African pygmy native. Would it be racially offensive to tell the Marco Polo story and show Asians from Asia? I know Wonka is fiction but..."
Not sure about this one...
Of course the kid he hangs out with is a black female...SJWs wouldn't have it any other way
I didn't think I would like it much but it seriously looks awesome.
This is kinda cringe
This shows that Timothee is really growing as an actor. I'm actually proud of him.
BRUHHHHH THE OOMPA LOOMPA 😭😭😭😭😭
Here we go. They ruined another great movie. Well done!!! Money talks. WB IS A DISGRACE!!!!!!!
im glad they used the oompa loompas from the orginal and not the remake
The only person caught my eye here is Mr. Bean (Rowan Atkinson). Even if I saw him for only 2 seconds in the whole video❤
So glad to see Hugh Grant playing something so close to his true self
I was skeptical at first but boy... we will be seated
wtf is this
"So we went from ""Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory"" to ""Willy Wonka"" to just ""Wonka"". I can't wait for the next release in 10 years called ""W""."
1:41 Was that Rowan Atkinson aka Mr Bean😃😂😂
omg Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa though
"Timothee is definitely one of the best actors of his generation. I can’t wait for this movie. It just fits the Christmas spirit. 
Damn we are in the middle of summer and I’m already thinking about Christmas."
How cute lol
Que mierda es esto
THIS LOOKS EFFING AWESOME OMG!!!
I won't be watching. This sucks!
"I’m surprised they didn’t get Ezra miller as wonka.. would seem a bit more fitting with his character, grooming kids and all"
bro where is jony dep??? helooo?
"Every time I see Timothée Chalamet in a movie, I see a young actor trying to play a character as opposed to someone embodying their character. I may be in the minority but there are far more talented young actors than him. He always comes off a bit too community theater."
Willy wonka
C'est un conte pour les Enfants 🤷‍♂️ attention à l'indigestion de Chocolat Wonka  🍫 🍫 🍫
Mr. Beast now laughing is corner: Sikeee.. I've already done that
June: It's chocolate...
who asked for this
oh? :]
Ugh he is so overrated
it's finally here and it looks amazing Timothee Chalamet is gonna do great in this and in Dune part two
crazehhhhhhhhhhh
The movie I never thought I needed
Call me crazy but this looks absolutely amazing
"When I saw that is was going to be directed by the same person for Paddington, I knew this movie was in good hands."
Wasn’t sure about this until the Chocolate Cartel just attempted to murder two people by drowning them in chocolate
They should've cast mr beast
best moment when Wonka Said '' its wonkaning time!'' and started wonkaning all over the place.
Stop the remakes
Mathew Baynton!
Acting looks overacting ngl over all is good
Nothing like Jhonny depp
"Nothing will event be as good as Johnny Depp version . This seems to Disneyed . The guy playing Wonka literally looks like your average boring white Vanilla bar … boring . Wonka is suppose to be weird , mad man , mix emotions , something magical not this boring white guy"
Is this the start of the Roald Dahl Cinematic Universe?
wowooowowowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwowwoowowowowowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i see mr bean im coming for this
"The Snowpiercer prequel, nice"
Cinema
Rowan Atkinson sold it for me.
I see where modern movie writers' creativity is going
New Cinematic Golden Age emerging?
this looks 4ss
"Since Mathew Baynton is in this film, and Simon Farnaby co-wrote the film, I wonder if any more Horrible Histories members will make a surprise appearance!"
Жопка
Snowpiercer is the sequel and now we have prequel
Feels like he's trying to mimic Depp's portrayal of Vonka. This light madness is visible in him
2023 is looking like a good year for movies
I didn't expect this coming!!! So excited!!!!!
"For some reason, I can't see Willy Wonka but only Timotheè in character. I hope the film is actually different, because its very important to separate a character from the actor. They could've done some makeup on him to change how he looked or done SOMETHING so he didn't look so Timmy. I guess it might be a good or a bad thing, will just have to wait and see."
"Imagine trying to do a role that was perfected by none-other than Johnny Depp. 
Willy Wonka would always be a masterpiece of Roald Dahl that would eternally remain in many of our generation ( 90s / early 2000s) generation.
Looks promising, hopefully Timothee & the team could deliver this art the way it’s supposed to be"
Can’t wait ❤
Is this the only actor available? Why is nepotism not working for the others and all the movies keep going to this same guy?
weird
Timothee chamalet or whatever he gonna kill this role
Okay this looks good.
Anyone else notice that Willy Wonka is almost always played by Americans in adaptations?
damn
"When creativity is lost, this is what happens..."
ah.. nostalgia hits hard..................... this time with thimothie....! let's hope it would be good
Definitely interesting but kind of ruins the mystery of gene wilders character in the original once you know his backstory
i love willy wonka so much dude!😎😍
"It seems like Charlie and the chocolate factory, doesn't it?"
"never thought that on my 30's , i'm gonna be so excited to watch MR. Willy Wonka once again.."
Been waiting for this for a long time
"The mad, manic genius of Gene Wilder will never be matched but you have to hand it to them here - it looks like they're really going for broke."
PERIOD STINKKKK
"This looks so whimsical, I absolutely love it. ❤
And having the director of Paddington makes it even better because those movies are awesome!"
this looks absolutely terrible
wtf r these botted comments
All these people saying its going to be great and I'm just thinking this looks awful.
The spice melange hitted Paul Atreides harder than spected this time!
MATHEW BAYNTON HELLO MY CHILDHOOD?1!:!!2?3!2
wow im in. This looks magical.
Nice! A prequel to Snowpiercer!
"Ah, why do we need this?"
Rowan Atkinson ?? nice ❤
This dune guy again? He missed the stage?
"Wonka: “I’ve spent the past 7 years traveling, perfecting my craft.” 

Me: *”So, you’ve been perfecting your craft… since you were 8?”*"
"I don’t like a love line. For what? We know, that he is lonely genius. She helped him with everything, believed from the begging …and to the Chocolate Factory story she left him? In a book his only one love was a factory. Always."
Leo tamil FANS🎉🎉🎉🎉CHOCLATE
I'VE BEEN WAITING THIS FOR SO LONG
Keegan-Michael Key is going to do great in this 💯
Is this a prequel to the 2005 movie?
the piccolo flute was an appreciated bust-out
You know  its been a Terrible  Run for Movies when they bring out These IP's .
"I had doubts but OMFG!!!!!!!!!!!
I am SOLD!!!"
A lot of these comments make my brain hurt
That was enjoyable.
Did we need a Wonka origin story?
Looks terrible.
Are we sure Chris Columbus didn’t direct this ? Cause this movie gives me Harry Potter 2001 vibes
Something that I didn't know I wanted and yet I never thought would've existed. Count me in for this Willy Wonka origin.
who up wonking they willy rn
Жоnka
Why????
I was iffy until the Oompa Loompa nostalgiad me back in time with that instrument and made me laugh.
"""Once we have started we can't stop...""😂😂"
Everything looks amazing except Tim's shallow performance....
"This might be hit or miss, but I’ll still check it out"
Just leave Roald Dahl alone.  He's given enough to our collective imaginations to have people who despise him continue to harvest his ideas and sully them with their insipid 'takes'.
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg .....................................................................................
Those reboots need to stop
Rowan Atkinson!!❤ nice this will be a hit for sure.
"1:41 bean?,"
Whait is that the actor of mr bean in this movie?
Was not expecting this film but it looks intriguing. Might check it out.
The original Oompa Loompa is back!!!!!!!
omggggg
shoutout to Matther Baynton from Horrible Histories 1:34
He's not Him!
"Color me interested, I actually watch the trailer via Cartoon Network Africa's Channel."
Timothy 🥺♥️🙌🏻
"Que hermoso la verdad, soy fan de la versión de Jhonny y esto es diferente y me gusta"
It's absolutely Glorious
"Wow, no way, this is now gonna be a movie?"
He will not be as good as Gene Wilder but I hope this movie is good
"Why would you possibly make this...

Two words: Gene Wilder. Leave the franchise alone."
"Stop the reboot, remake, prequel thing.

MAKE 🙌 NEW 🙌 STUFF!!!"
por que poner a gente color ?  por que ?  que necesidad
"Oh man this movie looks so much fun, looking forward to watch it"
1:02 Is that rowan atkinson? Damn I need to watch this
Can’t wait to see this movie because I like the other 2 Willy wonka movies and I think I might like this one as well
Жопка 👌
Willy Woke
"Ah, yes. So Willy Wonka has to take a stand against the evil German chocolate conglomerate and their evil german chocolates, because they are... German it seems. What a refreshing and totally new idea."
"Dune 2 in November. 
Wonka this Christmas. 
I see you Timothée."
this looks awful
Looks fun.  I will probably watch it.
Rowan atkinson!!
I thought he found the oompa loompas in a forest tribe place
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was not something I expected but I am gladly here for
жопка 🥰
i dont know how i fell bout this
"Since there's no Feastables, I ain't watchin'"
Yo
Daniel Thrasher is Willy Wonka?
"This looks so good but Timothee as Willy Wonka? Why the dead-faced twink, why?"
Honestly this looks better than what I thought
High Grant as an Oompa Loompa seems oddly perfect
Lily Rose-Depp must the only person in the world that can say that her dad and her ex are Willy Wonka
Those last few seconds killed me. 🤣😂🤣😂
Looks horrible
I'm absolutely obsessed with Hugh Grant's career choices these days! What a legend!
It’s a musical?
Cinema in 2023 is starting to be something else- best since 2014?
I may be in the minority on this but this looks absolutely insufferable
"It looks incredible, can't wait to see Timothée in a very different role !"
I wish we could see Johny here at least as a side character
1:41 its good to see Mr. Bean again
This looks so charming; I’m actually looking forward to this
"""The Chocolate Cartel""
I'm already in love with the movie"
"1:06 wait, is that?"
ROWAN ATKINSON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good but not to close johnney depp
"Paul Atreides: LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS!!!
Willy Wonka: Oh, don't be such a grump! Here, have some chocolate! Have you ever seen a FLYING spice worm?"
Another movie we didn't need
"Oh look, it's The Little Mermaid again."
"Love Timothée, but enough with the remakes, prequels and sequels! Lol"
omg paddington is one of my favorite movies ever so excited for this
0:54 is such an epic bone chilling reveal. The soundtrack is epic. Can't wait for the movie!
A prequel to the original 1971 classic and it’s coming out during the holiday season? Oh this is gonna be a delicious treat.
Spider-verse sequal lookin wild
They cant come up with new ideas they keep recycling old movies 😂
oh boy another dumb origin story by warner of course it is
"Sweet, unadulterated consumerism, just like Roald Dahl & Gene Wilder always dreamed! ..."
Woke
okay but im sure this will turn out amazing...but i still can't picture willy wonka being played by anyone except johnny 😩🖐
I'M SO EXCITED FOR THISSS
inget kan slå jonny deep tyvär
Is this a prequel to the old film or the 2005 film
"""Here we go, Momma."" 😥😢😭"
I didn't think I'd be interested in this at all but it honestly looks really good!
johnny depp better
"I really like the official trailer for Wonka and I am looking forward to seeing it on the big screen at the Cinema in December
#WonkaMovie"
I'm really sorry if I'm being negative but ANOTHER ONE?  SERIOUSLY? 💀
The movie no one asked for.
Why was I convinced the little guys were called Gronka Lonkas?
Now we'll  have to explain the REAL WONKA to kids  . Depp WONKA
Absolutely 💯 amazing
Not inclusive enough. Why is Hugh Grant playing an Oompa Loompa?
"So we have now Hugempa Groompa!! 😂

Looks pretty good! I assume this a prequel to the Depp Willy Wonka movie. I'll watch this!"
What?  Again?
2023 what are you!!?? A dream?? Omg❤
"Finally, a worthy competition to Johnny Depp!"
Mr Bean! 😯 1:03
I’ve literally been waiting for this movie for my whole life
"Wow, this looks terrible. Bad acting bad casting, Ripping off Tim Burton's style. Looks pretty dumbed down and safe for the masses so i get why people like it. Cue that colgate ad"
Really excited for this 🔥🔥
Ah another character ruined by the Hollywood shid machine
*@ **1:42* *Mr. Bean Is Spotted!*
Y Johny depp
It's gonna be a 6/10. I can just tell.
is this a prequel to the 70s one or the tim burton one or is its own thing?
Omfg!! Timothee as Wonka!!! 😂💓💓
Finally we get the Pennywise origin story we all wanted.
"I will spend money on a movie not owned by Disney, simply out of spite for Indiana Jones, Willow, Star Wars and the collapse of the MCU into CW trash."
2:08 OH NO YOU DIDNT 😆😆😆
"This Dune sequel is so colorful! After tasting chocolate, the spice isn't so important anymore huh."
That trailer was kinda wonky
"If you feel unloved, just know that Jesus loves you that he gave his life for you so that you may be saved! ❤ God truly loves and cares for you!
John 3:16"
I decided I was never going to see this but then I saw Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa
Is Wonka 2 going to focus on his descent into solitude and isolation prior to The Chocolate Factory? This looks good but doesn’t seem like the same Willie Wonka we’ve seen.
Timothy is one of the most skilled young actors. He has so much potential ♥️
"This just seems like a nice, colorful, imaginative movie with a talented cast having a lot of fun.  I hope it does well, I'm rooting for this one!"
Let see if this movie will make 500 million ❤
Talk about the range of Timothee 🔥🔥
am glad its not a sequel but a origin story
I love the part when he said it’s wonking time. Sent chills down my spine
Yikes
Finally a movie that feels like a movie
Is it just me or does like every remake/prequel just have the name of a character as it's movie title.
This looks cringe
#Leo Vijay Anna in an Alternate Universe😅

The Oompa Loompa dancing 😂
Something else blacked up and ruined.
Hopefully they address the historic 📜 exploitation of Africans 🌍 by Europeans 🗺️ in this chocolate 🍫 industry...
Wonka - The Gen Z Prequel
Wow
Oh dear
Ok I'm sold take my money
"Hollywood has officially run out of ideas, also the POC stick out like a sore thumb."
I think Timmy has found his true breakthrough role- this will be a big hit for WB at Christmas
This looks gorgeous! Can't wait
i'll check it. i wonder if its a musical like the original kind a was.
YOU LOSE!
1:01 promise? -a pinky promise 🤧
INTERESTING!
...this is gonna make me cry isn't it...
The cocoa must flow
Is Hugh Grant going to be the highlight as an Oompa Loompa??
I like how this is just acknowledging the craziness and is just having fun with it.
"""You know, I'm Something of a Scientist Myself"""

"I was expecting a prequel to the books, but not a prequel to the original movie ;u; when that orchestrated version of ""Pure Imagination"" came on...goosebumps."
Is this gonnna be a prequel?
Oh wow a hot Willy Wonka 🔥🍭🍬
This will be a musical right? ✨
"""no daydreaming"" is the worst law ever"
god that was awful...
only Wonka I know is Michael Scott
"It looks so nice. 
Expectations were created."
I CANNOT WAIT
"Thank God for a little originality, I just think Chalamet is just as overrated as Depp."
Well NOW he's in everything!
This looks absolutely awful if I'm being honest. Looking forward to watching Napoleon.
I am watching this movie for Neil Hannon’s work
"I dunno, on paper this sounded great, but this trailer gives me ‘trying too hard’ vibes just like Fantastic Beasts. So, right now I’m guessing good not great. We’ll see. Hugh looks amazing."
he isnt weird enough. was will poulter busy?
I'm in!
1:03 Mr.Bean is back!
not sure about this one...
all in.... a prequel is how you do it.
"Something feels bad about Timmy's performance. I think it's a miscast. His voice doesn't match Wonka's. Sounds like he's trying too hard, like he's cosplaying almost."
Im loving this camp era of cinema
I have several questions one of my biggest questions is why does mr. Wonka have a child assistant or little helper all of a sudden? And why does the Oompa Loompa look CGI
Жопка😅
"Looks pretty grand but I hope WW will still have a bit of a mean streak, Chalamet's version seems too much like a hero from this trailer. Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompah is inspired casting, Keegan Michael Key in a fat suit, Mr. Bean as a Priest!? I'm in"
Nah.
No hate but i can't be the only one who thinks he does not make a good Willy Wonka...
This looks AWFUL
1:03
"Still think they should've called it ""willy"" instead"
Why?
This movie is going to be a hot mess and I look forward to seeing it.
Didn’t think I would want to watch this. I was wrong lmao
trash
Ok did not know I needed Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa yet here we are😂
"“Scratch that, reverse!” I love that! Can’t wait for this to come out❤️"
Anyone going to come out with something original anytime soon or just stale talentless spin-offs?

what a terrible actor lmao
- count me in.
This looks genuinely funny
I....... I don't know how to feel about this..... but I'm smiling?
Yeah I’m hype to see this
थीसिस exciting
Why oh Why.
It's a no from me dawg.
Love Chalamet but he doesn't have this crazyness burning inside him that would make him a great Wonka
"So we are getting a origin story, and it only took 52 years and another 18 years for it to happen."
OH YAYYYY
Looks incredible 🎉
Ok if there was such a thing as a Daydream tax how many of y’all would go bankrupt
"no one talking about the on screen script at the start (if u put on captions it fills the whole screen)

Finally we got to see Willy Wonka origin story!! Timothee as Wonka is absolutely amazing.
unhappy thing.
You had me at Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa.
"That cast is stacked!!! Also, this has a magical vibe compared to the Tim Burton version that has a tinge of eeriness to it which is good too."
*_Timothy Chocolate🍫 !_*
"Go on then, looks magical silly fun 😀👍"
who wonking their willy rn
"Ew no, I hate Timothée Chalamet in the role. Something about his line delivery sounds like he's trying too hard"
Timothee doesnt feel right in this. He looks the part but his line delivery doesnt feel like wonka to me
I just started watching Downton Abbey so I just screamed 'Mr Carson!' 😂
The thirsty ones: can I have some chocolate 😏
Paul too high on that spice huh?
Does not fit the character poor casting
"Everything needs an ""origin"" these days."
Timothee looks great as wonka!! 🤩❤
The writing is absolutely terrible.
Thanks. I hate it.
This looks stunning
oh he ate
Looks ok they could have done  a better job on the casting
MAKE SOMETHING NEW
0:38 Cool
"wait, Chalamet is the new Johnny Depp?"
"Alright, consider me surprised!"
Idk Timothee Chalamet just doesn’t have that wacky charisma that’s associated with Willy Wonka
Wonderful 🎉
Paul King is the director? say no more!
The trailer we didn't ask for but desperately needed! Can't wait for this!!
He seems incredibly wooden and wrong for the role
OH NO HES HOT
sheesh
"When House Atreides was destroyed by the harkonnens, Paul decided to escape in a faraway planet to sell some chocolates."
"Ngl, this movie seems to childish, but i'll check it out when it releases"
this looks so amazing! definitely one ill be seeing in theaters.
"Please, no. Not another remake/reboot.
Nothing will ever be better than the 1971 film starting Gene Wilder"
"Man, I just love the soundtrack of in a world of your imagination. makes me want to look back on the first time I saw that Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory trailer and that was from a Pokémon the movie 3 VHS previews"
This looks amazing and hugh grant as a Oompa loompa is great
Is this the prequel of the one from the 70's?
Now we have know that the chocolate secret recipe is SPICE.
aww this kinda cute I cant wait to watch it on tiktok in 46 2min clips
Oh boy ... another reused idea ......
No
"I love the idea, but this looks like a huge miss to me.... starting with casting Chalamet as Wonka."
haha cant stop watching Hugh Grant at the end
Ugh. Completely missing the point of what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is.
I was iffy but seeing Hugh Grant as a oompa loompa really changed my mind
This looks really good!!
Mmmmnmn Pass… looks like fun but it can never be as good as the original
"When I saw this trailer, I was like thinking of saying if I were the subtitles of the previews saying of the story that brought you, Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory and Charlie and the chocolate factory brings you the story of the origin of Willy Wonka’s life"
not this CGI! cheap
i cant imagine anyone other than johny depp as willy wonka....but this looks good
i just don’t think timothee is meant to be willy wonka
"""YOU LOSE!!.....GOOOOOD DAY SIR!!"""
It looks like an incredible adventure but I always think back to the original movie and laugh XD This provides a whole new perspective on the man's character.
Oh!
This looks positively annoying
"i will never forget the moment my heart stopped reading ""the miracle"" WOW"
"I gotta be honest, not was I was expecting. I was expecting a retelling of the classic Charlie story, but another origin story is cool I guess."
"you bastards went casted hugh grant as an oompa loompa, that's dastardly and vile, I know where I'm going to be on december 15"
This is DISNEY movie?😅
Way to cover up the historically neglected Oompa Loompa slavery that contributed so much
It would be great to see how he spiraled into the creepy yet charming looney unhinged guy that he became. I want this movie to scar me or at least make me bawl in tears.
Did anyone else smile when that particular tune came from the flute of the Oompa-Loompa?
Well looking forward to it. Its a family friendly adventure movie so yeah.
"Finally, a movie that actually might have some real majestic in it."
The Oompa Loompa CGI looks worse than Sanic. Hope they fix it
Anything's better than that awful Johnny Depp Wonka attempt.
🆗
Spasibo... Thank You ..
Hugh Grant will be great in this!
his performance seems kinda hollow.. idk. im not sold on this
Hugh Grant a Oompa Loompa........you have my attention
"Wow, this looks like trash. I'll stick to the original."
Hugh Grant!? As an Oompa Loompa?!
Great casting... but it's got that same 'on a soundstage' feel as the Nutcracker or these live action Disney remakes like Mary Poppins...
"Wait, Mr. Bean became a priest and can talk now? Wow 😮"
Let's give it a chance.
I hope this will be better than the one of Johnny Depp. Because I like the prequel of the one of Gene Wilder.
Chocolate 🍫🍫🍫🍫 0:16
What a surprise 🎉.. Can't wait to watch it in Theater
I’m sooo excited I use love Willy wonka when I was younger 😊😊😊❤❤
Hope post credit scene maybe five main children characters born
"Got to watch some of this get filmed since it was in my city, interested to see if I can tell which scenes I witnessed when the whole film happens haha"
This feels more like a Disney movie than any Disney movie in the last few years
Mr Bean as a priest 👌🏽
wow!
this is terrible
So is this a biopic on a fictional character…? Extra points for thinking outside the box at least
"I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary. But I gotta admit, this looks quite good. And Timothee is very talented!"
"what.. on earth, i don't know whether to be happy or sad lmao"
"Okay first Warner Bros made the Barbie movie trailers and took over the world, now they’re dropping this?? Step aside Disney I think Warner is coming for your spot"
How many times we gonna re-do wonka?
Not everyone gets how talented Timotheé is.
lesssgooooooooooooo

A Willy wonka movie…how original
"THIS IS LOVELY ON SO MANY LEVELS, CAN'T WAIT TO PARK IT IN THE CINEMA 4 CHRISTMAS"
"This is the Gene Wilder Prequel, not Johnny Depp right?"
MATHEW BAYNTON !!!!!!!!!
"I heard about this film some time ago, but now watching the trailer is interesting me in how the film will turn out"
Roald Dahl would be proud
Жопка...
C'est d'la merde.
"Timothée is the perfect mix of Gene Wilder & Johnny Depp. 

Wonka seems as whimsical as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. As dark & poignant as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. & has hints of The Greatest Showman & Paddington.

I’m far more excited for this than Dune p2."
"If Hallywood wants to pay ransom to black people and make half of the actors black, it is better to pay attention to the fact that the people of other countries, where there is not even a black person among them, do not have to tolerate them"
So are they going for the Gene Wilder Wonka or Johnny Depp Wonka?
He's like a combination of Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder :O
FINALLY!!!!
No
Having to 'Big Up' the producer in the trailer is never a good sign for a good movie (just the amount of money that's gone into it).
tbh I can't wait to see Hugh Grants scenes in the movie!
nice to see rowan atkinson back
This is gonna be so good. 😭🙌🏽
Bring back jonny Depp
"Are all of these comments paid for? Not saying this looks bad per se, but who's the audience for this?"
Timothy is such an arrogant actor. He seems really full of himself.
First dune 2 and now willy wonka??? 2023 can't get any better
New movie to be hyped about😁
"Timothee Chalamet can nail any role. Even tho I am not a fan of prequels, I can see this has potential."
So this Willie Wonka is essentialy Daniel Thrasher in a hat
hot
This looks dead inside. And timothee does not due whimsical very well.
This is going to be great and just absolutely magical! Cannot wait to see Timmy as Wonka.
I was very unsure about this at first but now this looks alot better than I thought definitely seeing this great nod at the end to the gene wilder wonka with the oompaloompa
Directed and written by the man who made paddington? It's gonna be a masterpiece.
"the hugh grant oompa loompa is so unserious, i support it"
Wah its finally  back charlie and the chocolate factory when I was born in 2005 and now when I'm 18 Wonka.....😂  I love it .........
I'm not feeling it T_T
Timothée Chalamet?
again another one
I dont think i dont wanna hear that too late
This looks really good.
y augustoclub?
That actually looks good.. I had my doubts not gonna lie
"Having only seen Timothee take on serious roles, it's kinda weird yet incredibly refreshing to see him take on boyish and whimsy roles instead. I'd def watch this for Christmas."
"The original film is a classic, and I feel that I enjoy Depp's version more than most. But even with that said, I have to wonder what else can be done with this character 🤔"
"I like how he’s more similar to the original Wonka portrayed by Gene Wilder. Depp’s version was creepy, while Wilder’s was charming and whimsical. You can tell that’s what the director was going for, as the Oompa Loompa is the 1971 version."
This looks good. Even though I have never watched ANY Wonka movies.
Who up willying they wonka rn?
The cast oh my god
From the director of Paddington 😍 and the producers of Harry Potter 🥶🥶
this looks like my bloody stool
"Wonka :- “I am something of a magician”

Norman :- ur parents must be proud"
It looks terrible and anyone older than 13 knows it.
Looks pretty good
"If this movie were directed by anyone else but Paul King, it'd look really hokey. But this movie looks so delightful and fun. Can't wait to hear the songs."
Timothée Chalamet 🤎
Oh…ok
Should’ve had wonka from TikTok play willy wonka
Never thought I'd see Timothee Chalomet and Rowan Atkinson in one movie. Can we acknowledge how much Tim has grown as an actor though.
This really looks good except one thing. It's visible quite clearly that Timothee Chamalet is not upto the job and is phoning his performance in. It's all the more jarring considering how good Johnny Depp was in the Tim Burton adaptation was. Everything else looks awesome but I think Timothee's poor performance may break this movie for those of us who grew up on Johny Depp or any adult who notices Bad acting.
Can't be worse than the Tim  Burton one. Hopefully.
early
🤨😱 :D
Discover the became 12.15.23 in IMAX & dolby cinema
I’ll sure see it. The start of a world of pure imagination. ❤ ✨ 🍫🍫🍫
"If someone saw Rowan Atkinson at the trailer, please give me the timestamp, thank you."
Oh no.....😧😨
Would have preferred Paddington 3 but it’ll be worth keeping an eye on merely for director Paul King. Not entirely convinced by the CG Hugh Grant Oompa Loompah but it’s definitely got more charm than a dozen Disney remakes …
"I like how it's now lore that the oompa loopmas have to finish the song and dance once they start. Like its built into their instincts, more than something they like to do"
"This shows how chamaleonic timmy can be, I love this!"
This looks terrible...
Trasshhhhhh 😂😂😂😂
Charles the second is that you???
"I enjoyed the ""Paddington"" movies!!  Since the ""Paddington"" director is making this, this could be good!!"
"Hate to be so negative 
but honestly the CGI doesn’t look that appealing 
and Timothee Chalamet ONLY by the trailer isn’t that convincing 
ill be the minority but I think he is overrated 
Amazing in “call me by your name”
and mediocre with the rest
Sorry 😕"
Ok you have my attention as this does look better than I expected it to be
johnny should attend the wonka premiere
I like the part where he enslaves an entire species lmfao😂
Spotted some huge musical numbers there
I like that the Ooompa Loompas stay true to the original movie's version.
will be a hit
Please don’t butcher it again…
This looks absolutely stunning! Is anyone else getting greatest showman vibes from this?
"Hugh Grant is oompa loompa , I'm dying🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣💀"
Ahsoka and Wonka trailers dropping at the same time wasn't on my bingo card for the year but here we are
Wonder if Tim Burton gets involved in this movie
Miss you Jhonny Depp. 🥺
Not Hugh Grant as oompa loompa!
Im so glad they oompa loompa right!! I like Johnny Depp version but nothing beats the classics!!!
This turned out better than i expected.
This film looks like an EXPERIENCE.
LETS GOOOO
This looks promising
Why does this need to exist?? Who was asking for this?? 😕
Hard Pass
"Wait wtf, why does this look amazing?? 

It’s like a youthful Wilder plus a not-annoying Depp. Why is this doing it for me?!"
Somehow I remember Michael Scott from The Office
There better be a series of Wonka candy tie ins for this movie.
17 MINS AGO DJJSHSGS
Is that Johnson from Peep Show? What a legend
"Wow that's wow my childhood movie, can't waitt!!!"
2023 will be remembered as Timotheé's year🤍
I don't know Rick looks decent but somethings telling me Im gonna hear the Rock Dwayne Johnson sayin his meme phrase after the release😂 --->🐕💩👻
ehh
Yo this looks hype!
Hugh grant???????????
why this movie feels like 10 years old
Like a sad parody
I thought this was darker version but no...
"I hope this can live up to Depp's Wonka and even compliment it. I'm confident in it doing so because Timothée Chalamet is a phenomenal actor, one of the greatest of this time and his generation. 🙏"
"My favorite scene was when Willy Wonka said ""May thy chocolate chip and shatter."" Truly one of the Wonka moments of all time."
The Hughmpa Lumpa
I love how this is closer to Gene Wilder's Wonka than the Burton film. Especially with the perfect mix of both Oompa Loompas.
"Wait the chocolate guy’s getting a movie? And the short, masked, wears underwear as a costume guy doesn’t have one? 😢"
I JUST WONKED!!!🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥
"This looks like it could be the most accurate-looking Willy Wonka movie ever made, I mean it fuses perfectly the Gene Wilder film with a more Roald Dahl / Quentin Blake zany style so I just love this with every single cell in my body"
Going for a last-name title sounds like it’s gonna be super gritty. But I’m intrigued by what I see!
"Damn, Oppenheimer, Napoleon, and now wonka? What a year for movies"
he just doesn't look crazy enough
Looks like we're finally going to get another great live action kids film... I hope.
Wonka was a Black Transgender She-man!!! This is blasphemy!!!
Será? Pelo menos eu não me impressionou
Another remake?
Finally! They’re showing us some footage of this new origin story of Wonka!
Movie looks good but I think Chalamet feels forced in this role.
So... fatigued.
Looks funs and whimsical as it should be
im seated
"The story behind the great Willy Wonka before the mighty chocolate factory, Genius!"
Token black actress
Am impressed
Oh I’ve been waiting for this one
I can't wait!!!!!
Mrbeast version of Willy Wonka is better than this
meh
This looks pretty good
We don't get much whimsical children fantasy movies anymore. It's almost refreshing.
SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
I never expect to see Hugh Grant. What a treat ❤️
Love this ❤🥰🥰🥰😍😍😍😍😍
It looks so good

Why does the oompa loompa look like lord farquaad

I'm so excited!
Johnny depp is best willy wonka
"Director of Paddington

Alright im on board"
Timotheé is truly the icon of this generation. I was waiting for him to showcase his campy side. Will be front row on premiere night!
Looking forward to this one!
NO!!!
"He’s good, Timmy Tim. He’s gorgeous"
I'm shocked that Willy Wonka is white  in this movie.
amazing (:
"I seriously wasn't expecting too much. I went from a curious click to ""Oh snap, I'll go see that for sure!"""
Can't lie: Willy Wonka needs to be at least slightly psychotic
Is it just me or I still find willy wonka as lowkey scary?🙃
"Diversity police: ""Too many white people. Give him a random minority sidekick."" ✍️"
why can't we make new videos instead of making worse versions of a good movie
Screaming crying throwing up
"The goat rowan atkinson , the mr bean itself it is in the movie!!!"
The chocolate cartel lol
These dune lore are getting out of hand
He ain’t Johnny Depp…
already saw it Dave
"As the trailer went on I actually started to think it didn't look half bad! It's kind of funny though how we already kind of got a prequel in Charlie with Johnny Depp's version. I'm wondering if this will be completely different or if he will still have issues with his father. Also I thought I heard a bit of pure imagination in theusic but if I am mistaken, it definitely needs to be in the final movie."
Can't wait😢😢😢
Willy wonka is getting a prequel.
God this looks PERFECT??? No surprise it's from the director of Paddington
Woahhhhh. Breathtaking. Timmy's first Oscar?
DID ANYONE SEE MATTHEW BAYTON OMG
That Oompa Loompa caught me off guard and is sending me 😂
again?
Wow I’m actually really excited for this
Aaaa I can’t wait to see it!!!!
This looks absolutely charming and delightful!! A breath of fresh air in a time where movies are often SOOO serious...
Amazing 👏👏👏🍫🍫🍫🍬🍬🍬
"Isso vai ser muito nostálgico de ver!!!

I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good
I am so excited I can't handle it ❤❤
I have never felt so much wonder and magic from a trailer like this one my eyes opened wide and I was overwhelmed with delight and imagination and I started tearing up this is going to be something special can’t wait
There’s nothing better in cinema than a prequel / origin story. 📖
I hope its not too late for me to be an oompa loompa

"I’ve always wanted to watch a movie with two of my favorites, Timothee Chalamet and chocolate!!!"
"Box Office Predictions?:

Paul Atreides hasnt been the same since Dune

Whoa… this looks exciting!

Willy Wonka Is Back
Finally something different in narrative🔥
wonka dating kylie jenner is crazy
There should be a Wonka Chocolate Factory theme park
Eh...not really feeling it.
A wonka origin story is exactly what I needed.
"okay, but whoever picked timothee deserves a raise"
Timothy Chalmette is really trying to be the next Johnny Depp and I gotta say it's working of course he is not there yet
"my favorite part was when Wonka said ""Scratch that, reverse it, ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup I"""

GOD
I wasn’t onboard for another remake… but a prequel is different! Stoked!
"Must admit, i really looked forward to the movie, but i didnt like this ""Mary Poppins"" style and the ""wizarding world magic"" from the candy. Only thing that saved the trailer for me, was the end with Hugh Grant as an Oompa loompa."
I never knew a Willy Wonka prequel is what we needed 😭
Never thought I’d see the movie where Timothee Chalamet’s role is allowed to be happy 😭😭😭
Can't wait for this one!! What a year for movies ❤
I already know that Hugh Grant is gonna be my favorite part of the movie.
Didnt they just make a Wonka remake
"This looks like a CGI dumpster fire. In the immortal words of Lindsay Ellis: ""Thanks, I hate it."""
"Timothee Chalamet is a fantastic actor…, probably the best one from his generation…"
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Timothee Chamalamadingdong should stick to dune
Just imagine Wonka boning miss Kylie Jenner 💀💀💀😭
Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa 👌🏽
WOW!  I'm sold!  This looks like a fun movie for the family!
How woke is this movie.
not the biggest fan of Chalomet but maybe ill give this a chance
"I heard that Tom Holland auditioned for the role of Willy Wonka, but I know, Timothee will do great too. R.I.P. to Gene Wilder who originally played Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka and the  Chocolate Factory.

Johnny Depp was a great Willy Wonka too.

Can’t wait to see this movie though.

Also at 0:14, it was so nice to see Warner Bros & Village Roadshow Pictures working together again"
This looks sooo awesome!

"I dunno. Doesn't look like it's going to have the disturbing edginess of the original. It looks like every other PC kid's movie they make these days. Hopefully I'm wrong. And I still don't really know why Willy Wonka gave his chocolate factory away to Charlie, while he was still in his prime. Was he dying?!"
It's damn good.....
Vocal
Damn can they come up with any other concepts??? So tired of them remaking the same movies
This will be sweet.
Why is Timmy talking like Alyssa Edwards?❤😂
Vocal
High grant as an oompaloompa sold it for me
"Ok you got me... I'm looking forward to this.

Even though I more prefer Burton's movie cuz it adapts the book better, i still enjoy the Gene Wilder one and this one is like a mix of both 👏🏼"
this is gonna be amazing!
I did not expect this
Sometimes I wish Hollywood can leave classics alone
"Wow, Wonka movie looks like a lot of fun and awesomeness rolled into one! So can't wait!"
This doesn't look too bad. I did like the previous 2 Willy Wonka films with Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp and the MrBeast video that he did last year. I'll watch it.
"Should've called it ""Willy"""
I’m not sure what everyone thinks looks good about this. Please explain for me and I’m going to rewatch the original and read the book again to see why this looks good. I’m assuming these are the bots.
Seems so good i just want Jhonny depth in a scene
"I think this looks good, i like the different variations of Willy Wonka, Gene Wilder was more self aware and sarcastic, Johnny Depp was more needed and a strange. and now Timothy. 
Looks good, cant wait"
Christmas is gonna be the best month for Wonka ever 🎄🎁
Love so much❤
So many good movies this year looks great 🔥
"Was really hoping for a little snippet of Timmy singing. Oh well, maybe next trailer?"
TIMMYYYY I MISSED YOU
I Wasn't That Hyped For This At All But.. After Seeing This Trailer I'm All In For A Willy Wonka Prequel  Now And Can't Wait To See It Unfold 😁
Жопка❤
Johnny Depp was the best Willy Wonka ever.
SHAKING
"The movie looks amazing, I can't wait for it to be released in theaters <3"
i'm pretty sure that Timotheé is the most handsome man in the world.💜
Once Again I somehow predicted a trailer.
Why did it have to have the fantasy flying element…. Hmmmm
nah. we didn’t need this.
Look at the magical
Timothee Chalamet will OWN the role!
Is that Mr. Mosby from Suite Life?
Willy Wonka's origin a perfect prequel
"I think they just cast the oompa loompa just right.
He cracks me up."
Finally another willy wonka🥰
"Oh, this is gonna be a huge success. Millions will wanna see this just to see Timothée and another millions just so they can experiencing childlike wonderment again. And I'm here for both."
"Depp: Timothee, ur acting so natural"
Wonka but in his earliest life looks interesting!
Who up wonking their Willy  rn
"Hugh Grant and the 'scratch that' line are kinda witty, the rest looks very ordinary, very sub-Potter"
Why Paul Muaddib Atreides here...
I’m definitely watching this movie 🤩
What Charlie imagined as Grandpa Joe told him Wonka's story:
"timothee’s versatility is crazy, we’ll be the johnny depp for the new generation"
Checked out as soon as Keagan Michael Key showed up 🥱🙄
CAN DECEMBER COME FASTER ALREADY???????
I love Timmy and Wonka and together ahhhhh ❤
"I literally cannot wait for this! Like I used to watch the old Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder like every year, and now we have a prequel that looks just as good, if not better to me."
I NEED MY GOLDEN TICKET
"Wonka, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, what’s next on the Hype list?"
Жопка
Epic! What a classic!
He just plays himself in every movie
Looks so good! Timothy is such a skilled actor...he can play anything and makes it look effortless! Can't wait!
🪭
"Another Oscar is ready to Timothee! One of the greatest movies of the year, maybe the only one in this year! I can't wait!!!  Amazing, fascinating and breathtaking!!!! Well done!!!"
Crispin Glover should play Wonka. He was great in Epic Movie
Hugh Grant threw me off at the end  😂
Anotha one
OH MY GODDDD
it's giving Paddington vibes
Why?
I’m in. It’s different enough and his acting is so nuanced.
It looks great🍡🍭🍬
And perfect movie for Christmas 😊
Man I love his Gene Wilder energy.
I love it. People! The variety our Timothée can present us with.  🙏💚
DUNEの時とはガラリと印象変わるw
"a bit disappointing, i thought it was more about willy wonka's adventures in search of the ingredients"
huh ! anyway its going to be a flop 😪
oh this one is going down on history books!!
i really hope that the 5 winners make a appearance in this movie!!
Who up Wonkin they Willy rn.
0:13-0:15 Nice to see Warner Bros. & Village Roadshow Pictures teaming up again.
I'M SO READY
MR. BEAN'S BACK!! I honestly more excited to see him
Trailer 2 Please!
Surprised they didn't make Willy a half black quarter indian quarter chinese transexual hermaphrodite with how the world is these days. Maybe in the sequel.
Hugh Grant as an Oompa loompa is GENIUS casting...!!!
Looks pretty good!!
A story of how Willy wonka became a the greatest chocolate maker of all the world!
This looks surprisingly good! The musical numbers look fun
I saw that the director from Paddington was directing…I’m sold
Looks really good tbh
HUGH GRANT IS AN OOMPA LOOMPA!!! I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE
"""LONG LIVE THE OOMPAS!"""

"I thought that this wasn't connected to either of the movies that came before, but the character designs definitely make it seem like a prequel to the OG Gene Wilder movie.

Those are big shoes to fill, but I hope they can pull it off."
8 minuet...I've never been this early....
OH MY GOD HES SO FIT
Epic
Who else wonking up their willy
Cant wait!!!
Hi
OH MY GOD?!?!!!? HE IS SO PERFECT FOR THIS ROLE!!! I AM SO EXCITED
Wow! This looks interesting and beautiful! 🤩
First time seeing Timotheé take on a fantasy and musical role?!! Boy be expanding his acting profile! Can’t wait!
Why that actor tho 😡
"Wait, this is prequel to original Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder. Don’t get me wrong, that movie is good, but Charlie and Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp is closer to book. I thought it was going to be prequel to that movie."
johnny cameo must be included
Wow
so is this like a prequel to the 2005 Johnny Depp film?
a talking oompa loompa ^^ that's nice ^^
"Looks cute, something for the kids to enjoy at Christmastime."
Charming
He needs his Willy
I still think Michael Bay would have been a better fit for this.
Looks amazing 👍
Hugh F**king Grant as the Umpaloopas
Não me empolguei.
Oh god! If Roald Dahl was alive he'd probably hate it
Wait this looks good
The cocoa must flow.
Many people have come here to sell chocolate but theyve all been crushed by the government Sugar tax
Lets hope this movie gets the numbers it deserves🙏🙏
I can't wait to watch this! It looks wonderful!
Finally Jonka
This is the best birthday gift ever. Thank you for this.
LOL This looks bad.   WB scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas.
Did anyone notice Rowan Atkinson????
"He is no Johnny Depp that is for sure.
But the black representation with the little girl and Willy wonk will hopefully repair the problem the book had."
Ngl this looks amazing and I need it. And I want chocolate now.
Surprisingly on time. can't wait.
Actually looks charming
Pleeeease let it be good. I went to see the Charlie & the chocolate factory theatre production this year & it had been mutilated by wokery. Don't let this be the same 🙏
Breaking Bad : Chocolate Edition
This brings johnny kind of memories😢❤this Will be epic
Is that Mr Mosby
Michael Key!! 😂😂😂
Why the weird accents mish mash?  Looks good though.
We makin it out of Oompa Loompa Land with this one
love that they brought back the og oompa loompas
I will watch the s**t out of this movie 🍫🍬🍭
Who saw our legend?
i want Timothée Chalamet to turn me into a blueberry
Im guessing this will be the origin of Gene's version and not Depps.
"i’ve always wanted to know how he became wonka, guess i’m gonna find out when it releases at cinema, looks amazing!"
"Not only did this answer my question, this is a prequel to the gene wilder Willy Wonka, but it will be bloody magnificent"
This looks beautiful!
Gee this is wonkus😉
ITS WONKA TIME
"I thought it would be more like Dep's version, darker. This is the kid's version 😢"
"It gonna be kinda funny to watch Warner Bros compete with themselves this Christmas with this, Aquaman 2, and The Color Purple."
Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa. I’m Sold!
"Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Doo, I’ve got another prequel for you."
TIMMY I WILL BE YOUR OOMPA LOOMPA
1:41 IS he rowan Atkinson ?
I think Warner Bros is healing
looks like a supervillain origin
"Looks so adorable, but i don't know"
TIMOTHEE HAS DONE IT AGAIN 🔥
"The director of Paddington , I am absolutely INVESTED"
Timothee dances. Take my money 💰
Glad its not a reboot really...
TIMOTHEE IS A MASTERPIECE!
I have a feeling that this film might get nominated at the different movie awards since this had potential on being surprisingly good
tehe me and baba hashtag hyped
i'll catch it on streaming. and then probably skip thru it
Where’s the part about when Wonka realizes how much fun he would have killing misbehaved children
Paul king is back after Paddington 2. Excited for this one
"That ""no daydreaming"" rule made me chuckle for some reason"
*We at some point we would get a Willy wonka solo movie… AND WE ARE! Looks dope ngl.*
This actually looks really good 😳
"Typical Hollywood,instead of hiring a dwarf to play a Oompa Loompa,they had to digitally cgi a normal size man to play one."
I’m so hyped I love Willy
A 2 minute trailer already gave Willy Wonka a better origin than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory did
"You had me at from the director of Paddington. Also, never in a million years would I have thought Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was something that I needed in my life but here we are."
This looks... so...boring
I don't know if you can hate on this one after watching the trailer. It looks great!
timmy is eatin this year
This seems like a completely different movie but it’s surprisingly still set within the Willy wonks world
I Can't wait to see the prequel film before Charlie Bucket in the early 1970s classic movie ever to be created.
2005 Wonka (Johnny Depp): Too much chemistry 😎
uh he’s not very good lol
Huh..neat
"Kinda don’t like his Wonka acting, comes out a bit unnatural in a wrong way, will need to wait till the movie comes. Love timothee, just need to see more.. Cinematography looks amazing tho 👀"
MR BEANNN
Hugh Grant is going to be the best umpa lumpa I've ever seen.
Chocolaaaaaaate
We will be watching
This might become my favourite Timothee Character
Paul Atreides from worm rider and prophesied Messiah to candy factory owner.
Mr Bean in this film! Let’s go it’s about to Epic!
MR BEAANNNNN ❤❤❤❤
Magical 😍😍
“Try some more. ...
🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣 I love it!!!!!!!
I love the original movie and I know I going to love this prequel
"OMG I love Timothee as Wonka, so looking forward to seeing this movie"
жопка))
"Ah yes, a Willy Wonka manifesto before he started murdering children."
Ok it looks good but the title of the movie is so lame lol
This looks incredible
Imm going to be there opening day.😂
Timothee Chalamet looks perfect as Wonka
I never knew I needed Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa
НЕГРЫ!!!

Oonka Loompa!

Nice to see that the Oompa Loompas will have more a personality than just being singing bots lol.
Looks great wow
dull
alright im in
This looks really good! Chocolate Cartel😂
This cast is so incredible 🙌🍫
Cool
Timothe seems very charismatic. This doesn’t look too bad. I’m not a huge Wonka fan. But I’ll watch because I like a good musical.
"yeah, I cant see Timothy as Willy Wonka, ill pass"
Seems promising!
Beautiful. I’m in tears already.
Little Joel should be glad they didn’t forget the oompa loompas
"Damn this movie takes me back, got the exact feel of the mid 2000 movies I used to watch as a kid"
Cinema.
I never tought it'd happen..wow!
"here we go, mama 😢"
Beautiful 😍😍
I likes!
This is definitely gonna be a hit! Cant wait
Senti a energia de Harry Potter! Poderiam transformar numa saga mágica
This looks like a wonderful world of pure imagination.

Was hoping this would be a horror movie like the original but this also looks good
I see future in timothee

"I love you Timothee, Wonka, & Gene Wilder ❤"
"Omg, Timothée Chalamet! Our new Willy Wonka. ❤"
Gold ticket 🗿
Wah ada Mr. Bean
"Johnny Depp made such a convincing Wonka in my eyes, now everyone else who tries it just looks like they are cosplaying depp"
Timothee is winning an Oscar
Time to take a trip through a World of Pure Imagination

No way they made a movie about the Mr Beast’s video  😱😱
IM SO EXCITED
Wonka's origins
Excited
Missing Oompa Loompas 😢
Timothee is PERFECT for this role!
Wow
I have mixed feelings about this
"Horrible CGI, just look at 0:25 or at the oompa loompas, seriously horribly made cgi"
Looks really good
That looked great!
His acting is so bad and unbelievable wtf....
"Wonka is Жопка on russian , it's a as$. This words look simply for russian community"
excited to see this!
Im gonna watch this just for Rowan Atkinson
My eyes rolled so hard they fell right out of my head.
Omg
Hope this movie helps restore the old charm of Hollywood movies..🔥
"“However small the chance might be of striking lucky, the chance was there.”"
Please let this be good. 🙏🏾
Omg 🎉
Of course there’s a black person

Timothy really has been killing it these past few years
❤
"This brings me back to my childhood memories!!! I love the trailer, it’s going to be a great movie. ❤️"
"This December, we finally learn the origin of the worlds greatest chocolatier.🍫"
The oompa loompas looks so beautiful
Ooooh yess
"A new Movie for the Holidays, love it"
Now Paul Atreides is going to traffic in The Spice Melange?
68% rotten tomatoes. Calling it.
Beautiful.
Interesting
Looks like something Disney would make…recently that’s not a good thing
Director of Paddington sign me up
"The entire point of Willy Wonka's character is how enigmatic he is that it leaves you asking so many questions about him... do we really need an origin story for the character?

In addition, I'm still waiting for that Coyote vs. Acme trailer."
The Story about the creation of the best chocolate shop of all fiction
The prequel how it all began
Its wonderful 🤗❤️
"It's whimsical, let's go"
And Tim said Wonka! 👀
I ❤ timothée chalamet
Timothée looks so good in this!!
😮🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥

Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
"Uh, cool I guess"
I'm obsessed already 🍫🍬🍭
never thought i’d hear the words “chocolate cartel” taken so seriously
So far the trailer peeks my interest also Rowan Atkinson is always amazing to see
"Looks quite imaginative and might be good, I mean it is by Paul King so I’ll definitely give it a watch!"
I did not think I'd like this... but it looks amazing.
IS THAT MR BEAN
is that timothee?
"I still think Gene Wilder is the definitive Willy Wonka but may he rest in peace, I'll give this movie a chance"
This looks interesting
Timothee looks great as Wonka!!! So excited for this movie!!!
2nd
This the magic session
"Timothee proves himself once again to be a versatile actor that has so much to offer. 

He’s not this generation’s Johnny Deep or Leo. 

He’s the one and only Timothee Chalamet!"
Cannot wait!!!
