This was so good actually personally the songs as well my god
gene was better
There is a lot of politics in this movie  But there is a nice message in it 
"Black people 13 of US population
Also black people 50 of every modern movie including ones about Victorian England Lmao Laughable"
Willy Wonka and the little chocalate girl

I watched it last night and I cried 3 times on the movie The acting is really good and heartfelt  solid 10010 
Wonka  um dos melhores filmes de 2023 uma grande surpresa Um filme lindo emocionante e muito cativante seja pelos cenrios figurinos e atores  Timothe Chalamet est incrvel ele consegue transpor muito bem toda a essncia do Willy um jovem chocolateiro ingnuo e sonhador que busca ter espao no monoplio do chocolate E  lindo ver toda essa jornada dele eu amei esse filme 
They figured out how to give a black woman a starring role in even this story  And she taught the guy how to read no less   Thank you sub Saharan Africa for Willie 
That guywilly Wonka is from little princess movie also
The movie was better than i thought it would be ngl
The lisan alikiba as wonka dont work
In this movie i was get confused because in first movie Willie say he first time eat chocolate was with his father and he living with them when he was child but here in new movie is that he is with mom and she give him first chocolate taste so i little bit confused there  I am alone with that or not
Ngl this movie was a massive disappointment
What a load a boring crapola As usual Been there done that
Yeah KATYA was right This is Alyssa Edwards
Um lixo
A child playing Willy Wonka is stupid Im not looking forward to seeing this but feel I have to to give it a chance Love live Gene Wilder  the real Willy Wonka
WOKA
I dont know what to make of this
Ompalommpa doopadu doo I got a bad feeling about you
I hope you change the name of the movie since it is not related to charlie and the chocolate factory The back story of wonka in the charlie of the chocolate factory is different to this story The movie is good but if you expect that it is the back story of wonka it is not

Dont want to spoil but the ending was edited very weak I could of cried really hard but they pusd out Crying is kind of a guilty pleasure so what a let down
""
So instead of creating something original they remake a remake I have an idea Lets do a remake
wonka what country is that
oh
Can we just have something new
Its a diverse cast for sure
Who up Wonking they Willy
Uuuuum where is Charlie 
Dont know a single person who has watched this
Theyll probably start making the real wonka bars again after this movie
All the big movies are movies I have already seen I think Hollywood  Disney are not capable of originality Popular culture has become boring over this past generation
Meh
My favorite part is when Wonka added a little too much spice and started dreaming about leading a group of desert folks to paradise 
Um i think i saw the woman from Paddington bear 
I like my chocolate absolutely insane  This movie is just what the chocolatier order
Halfway through the trailer I said  ok this has to be a must watch asap
Wonka Kay Jhonny deep
Anyone who wants to watch this is brain dead
The songs arent very good at all They arent magical and they are way overproduced sounding The movie itself and the story are wonderful but the songs ruin it for me
I just made an original song called WONK give it a listen if you like the franchise 
The Spice must flow
ohh 
this nostalgia show returned to my brainMad Respect
Willy Wokea lol Hollywood just cannot help themselves anymore SMH
What a garbage movie this was xD
I like the movie but I expected more for a storylinethe storyline was really weak
What a stupid movie
No matter how many times you remake or revisit this None will be better than the one with Gene Wilder
ok gzel beendim arayz ok iyi
Ooooooo
Enfes bir film ok zevk aldm izlerken

It is the metaphoric version of a drug dealer Will Wonka  Walter White  notice the WW name resemblence trying to beat all the other drug cartels in the town and own the whole marketplace with his amazingly purified crystal meth  chocolate candies You dont believe me Well just think about it  wink wink
who tf hired mark rober
Can we see a little creativity in the film industry Maybe not a remake of a film that was perfect

Imagine absolutely nobody asking for a remake and then bam it comes out Make a new movie you absolute dead brained pathetic childish writers I can get absolutely plastered and propose WiLlY wOnKa ReMaKe take your parents money and use it else where if you want to rinse and repeat another movie and make a creative twist that literally isnt anything
No day dreaming

5 min in and the cringe was too much Couldnt do it
why cant these writers stop stealing other peoples originals why cant they be imaginative and think for themselves and do their own work all their doing is getting credit by being a copy cat that aint being successful People already seen the story we dont need to see it 30282992 more ways leave the classics alone and create your own
May thy chocolate chip and shatter
I watched this today I think it is a very good Movie made in a classic tradition I encourage true Movie Fans to watch it  I found it very enjoyable
WONKA  This was GREAT  The lead actor Timothy has charisma makes the movie great  Love him Great casting Great storylineWONKA is greatWorth seeingI just watched it 03172024
Wonka have chocolate like kit kat
I love wanka
I love it when the trailer is better than the movie itself
"DEI in every scene  Nothing looks natural   Forced mind control from the woke left
What an awful movie   Amazing how every scene in every movie these days  looks like a NYC Subway at morning rush hour   
Such embarrassing nonsense hollywood keeps putting out  Woke woke woke woke woke poison"
When I first saw the trailer I thought he wasnt the right actor but then I saw the movie he was amazing
This was awesome and the music was fantastic My kids and I enjoyed it so much I would love to finally see a familyfriendly Charlie and the Chocolate Factory not a dark creepy one  with Timothe and the same lighthearted hilarious magical fun from this movie
Show me a video where the man is wearing his mask in public while he is wearing his glasses
The opening musical score in the movie brought back such a fond memory of Gene Wilder that I never thought existed in my mind
And thats how we got the meme
the movie is highly overrated it is 50 musical with great graphics but scenes being poorly directed The best part of the movie is the Oompa Loompas song
Timmy ATE
Kong has the best look ever and Scar king is epic
Im 35 and I get excited for movies very rarely I went into this with very low expectations I still have deepseated trauma from seeing the last remake of this movie But this Delivered on all fronts Original story adorable and memorable characters and probably most importantly for a musical new songs that are actually good songs And this is coming from a guy who would probably rather watch predator for the 200th time rather than a musical reboot ew gross  My childhood has been robbed from me enough thank you very much Disney This is a solid movie I actually think Timothe Chalamet can be a little bit one dimensional at times but I respect him for this because he took a risk I mean hes not actually a very good singer and its obvious before anyone gets mad no Im no better of a singer  But thats what I appreciate about him he read a great screenplay and he put his heart and soul into this role  This whimsical silly roll for a serious actor is such a risk and he took it And in doing so totally proved the doubters and haters wrong Im not a hater I dont have the energy for that but I was a doubter This again With this guy Yeah good luck I bet this is garbage I love being proven wrong This is a solid movie
as good as the movie isits not good enough without jhonny depp may be its just me but the new guyisnt jhonny and without jhonny its not wonka
I see thousands of fanatical legions of Oompa Loompas making chocolate in my fathers name
Its my favorite movie i it
Needs more johny dep
150 she from paddington
Definitely prefer This movie over Charlie chocolate factory Now we just need to see a movie about the factory spies
Timthee is a great actor
ima have to stick wit Johnny depp sorry 
This film was amazing
Ngl the only reason I gave this a go was because Paul King directed it and after Paddington 1 and 2 Id trust him with my life This was such a sweet delight and Im glad I didnt go into it cynically It was just a heartwarming romp 3
I just watched this movie with my partner and his parents tonight it was amazing I was told it was good and I love it With a hit movie like Wonka its going to head to Broadway 
Timothe Chalamet as Wonka is the most graceful thing to exist 
Im a 30 year old metal head musicals have never been my thing Theres a few I find entertaining enough to sit through FORRRR A MOMENTTTTT LIFE DOESNT SEEM QUITE SOOOO BADDDDD  and lets not get me started on WELLL THERES CHOCOLATE AND THERES CHOCOLATE Side note his moms chocolate bar hit home for me my mother wasnt really present during my childhood Not because she was a bad parent just circumstances I have a wonka bar she gave me as a kid and now since Ive bored you with a cliche lemme just SCRUBBB SCRUBBB this comment 
Bad movie
Whats with all the black people
Woka
I need to watch a movie now I have to watch a movie Dance Moms
Watching this solidified my desire to commit suicide in the chocolate river
It was ok def nothing special
Rowan Atkinson the best 
This movie was awful Woke Garbage
In our English book there is a chapter the invention of vitawonk from charlie and the great glass elevator
I saw Rowan Atkinson here This movie must be very good
Its soooo fun to watch Absolutely loved it
Whats going on This movie is a fukin musical  The original was better as always  Its like people are getting more n more fruity af Trash movie
Im extremly dissapointed I had so much excitement for this and to say the least its boring Im half way throigh and im forcing myseld to finish lol
Andrew Garfield best male actresswish see him in this movie
This looks absolutely shizer
Wolper rock on candy peter is 80s flashback rocker g5nationtonation
 Timothy hit this outa the park Had me singing laughing and crying back to back  instant classic
Rip Gene Wilder WillyWonkaAlways
This movie made me miss Gene Wilder even more This was bad
Such a disappointment
Watched about 15 minutes of this movie and its a total joke just another movie remake that they destroyed horrible what they do to old classics what a shame
Surprised they didnt make him black like all the other characters theyre race swapping these days
This was apart from Oppenheimer the most boring film i have ever seen I fell asleep and thanked god i woke up at the end My niece loudly said mummy can i play on your phone halfway through and the whole theatre laughed to bits as we all felt the same
"Lame  stupid movie that has no connection to the original 
Inclusion is a great thing but seriously this is an assault on the mind"
Its magical Ive watched it about twelve times I just love it
Loved it  
movie was trash af dont recommend anybody watch it
I was lowkey hating on this movie at first as I really love the other films However I just watched it on HBO Max and I looooved it Timothee did a great job
Its an ok movie on its own but dont attach Willy Wonka to it I think the only way to do Willy Wonka is to remake it same thing but with different actors shot differently more of a real feel to it maybe I think most people like the original it because its nostalgic
I am pretty sure he put LSD to his chocolate after watching movie
MuadDib really seems to have turned a new leaf
I all forgot one think that I did not say when wonka shows the video of him when he was a kid when he tried chocolate from his mother
In 2025 January the 2nd
I Hope you make a new Wonko movie called Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory  where it has all the same people from the Wonka people and the same Willy Wonka from the Wonka movie the same kids from the Wonka and the chocolate factory but this time its different its like after the Wonka movie where its like the wonko movie mixed with the Wonka and the chocolate factory were The grandfather the child and Wonka went in the flying elevator were the kid see the town that he lives in and the ending has him when wonka showed his mother but only the picture and  show the people who lost in the chocolate factory and the child gets the giant chocolate and shows his old chocolate factory where it was burnt
I really enjoyed this movie Its worth a look see
I love the movie 
This movie really sucks
Please make another wonka we need it cuz this was a masterpiece please
Love this movie and that they used the old songs
Why am I just now finding out about this What rock have I been under
Wow I truly enjoyed every thing about this beautiful master piece the music the actors absolutely a phenomenal movie for the whole family 
"interesting  story  idea  great  music
a bit odd  but I enjoyed the chosen actors
much better  than previous  version"
Gaslighting musical goofy movie yes the original was a musical but actually had good story that made the songs almost an after thought
Just watched downtown Abbey so weird seeing mister Carson like this 
Paul atreides after resigning as an emperror
is this guy Charlie in WIlly Wonka OMG IS COOL
I watched thus movie today in the cinema Just fabulous 
Boring woke drivel
This was an excellent theatrical production I mean that literally It wasnt cinematic It was a theatrical musical Between story song and dance it was charming poignant and cute I dare to say it will be a classic I remember hearing it bombed at the box office No matter It might take 5 years streaming It will be so
They checked a couple boxes Not for me Sucks bc it looks cool
3rd best movie from timothee chamelon
None of the Wonka films have been good at all  Why do you guys always make it so bad 
Is this geared towards adults
i love this movie but no one is beating Johnny Depps Willy Wonka
He is not Willy He is grown up Charlie 
Flacid really At times it perks up but overall a snoozefest that wont be revisited
Watch out for the chocolate sandworms
Worst bit of Woke garbage I have ever  paid 5 minutes to Disney just sucks anymore
American accent is so wrong for this 
They should have casted Megan thee stallion instead of that girl
who wonkin they willy rn
This movie does not star Timothee Chalamet It stars Timothy Motherfuking Chalamet Thats the first reason I want to see this Two anytime the little guy sticks it to the big man is a win in my book even if its a prequel of a remake of an adaptation of a book And number three I really want to know how this man turns into a child kidnapper Plus Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is something I didnt know I needed in my life
would have been a decent film if ye old England werent made black and woke
Abysmal acting as usual from Timothy

Es un musical mas que nada
Seems fun seems like a movie with an old soul And I dont just say that because of the setting I mean it seems like the movie just wants me to enjoy the movie
Im sitting in the theatre right now all by myself getting ready to watch it Hopefully it will be good
Took my son to see this and thought I was gonna fall asleepnope I enjoyed it more than he did probably lol 
I dont understand why we needed this movie we already had two before it Sure one was in the 80s and showing its age but the other was as Modern as it could get and wasnt showing its age in the slightest so I guess we have three Charlie and the chocolate factory movies and still ZERO glass elevator movies sequel why has god forsaken us
Now this made me happy and cry at the sametime Joy  i cant wait to see this movie 
I watched this flim and its azming But what Id love most about the ompa loompa is the very time he met He reminded him he is always in debt
The film industrys woke virtue signaling is ruining everything And why the fk choose a little boy to play wonker total bs
This is what would happen if paul straight up snorted the spice
i  reley  want  to  watch  it
Wrong casting
This movie looks so catgacating
WHAT IS THAT ITS NOT THE UNKNOWN
I want to watch Wonka but my brother brought me to watch a different movie just now but the guy in the movie looks like Wonka
Why do a lot of movies have this vibe of cringe
I give it 5 bags of popcorn
Need a refund because I only came to watch The Unknown
No other race whine about their race not being on the filmsave for the blacks for some reason This movie forcefully replaced the main characters to amature black actors Just not a movie for me I dont like movies that race swap for no good reason
Sat through the whole thing waiting for the scene with The Unknownhe isnt even in it
garbage shite
Didnt have The Unknown 010
Still better than Glasgow
Willy before Wonka
My favorite scene in this movie is when Willy fights The Unknown and sucks him into a vacuum
You would never know it by the trailer but THE NEWEST WONKA MOVIE IS MOSTLY A MUSICAL If you dont like a lot of singing in a movie youll probably not appreciate this movie
Musicals movie

"comment movie
 blast boat a lay down   "
I want a factory that produces spice
"This story is before Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The film is based on a novel Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The movie tells the story about Charlies childhood so we can know why Charlie is obsessed with chocolate
I love the acting music and graphic in this film Timothee Chalamet plays the role of Willy Wonka My favorite character is Willy Wonka because he is very bright and creative In addition music and graphic in this movie was so amazing I was moved with songs and graphic was definitely beautiful
I think this is a great film for people who like fantasy movie and Timothee Chalamet It makes Timothee Chalamet more charming The story is a little bit sad but positive and exciting
Ill give Wonka five stars I want to watch one more"
How did Willy Wonkas eyes end up turning blue and his hair going blonde Maybe hell look more like Gene Wilder in part 2 3 4 or 5 
Wonka meme
Love the new wonky film 
I like Timothe but he aint no Johnny Depp Johnny gave a perfect unsettling creepy vibe to Wonka that Tim is missing also Johnnys character was actually faithful to the book this new movie completely missed the point and vibe of the book or any of the messages and lessons of it this isnt suppose to be some colourful happy go lucky fantasy fairytale

Rowan Atkinson
025 is this the GROS HORLOGE of Rouen
Aardman  Ambiln Entertainment  Jim Henson  Dreamworks  IlluminationThe Santas Claruz 2048 Official Trailer 2
Holy cow does that movie look good
Nice Trailer
"Entertaining to say the least but not worth the hype  good enough to pass sometime lots of continuity with the original movie but are we not somewhat cheated over the stage set designed in front of us to say this is the movie you dont get to see  the factory why it closed down and then one day why smoke started coming out of its chimneys and it reopened with great mystery 

Why we stick to a stage set that reminds me of the Harry Potter sweet shop with puking pastels alongside a magical luggage case that expands into a mini chocolate factory is why Fantastic Beasts also gets a reminder alongside start up businesses with the cake shop 

The film seems to get stuck between the hotel location and shop to a point that as a musical based on the umpa lumpas being musical people its more in line with a west end staged production good if your a huge fan of that sort of thing Then theres the over use of HD optics that take away the flicker of the big screen and magic of moving pictures Its all rather too clinical to feel like a movie IMO and you"
so where did the green midgets come from
If it aint Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder I dont want it
this movie is so fun
Awful please do yourself a favor and dont watch this cringe fest
this sucked brutally thanks again for ruining  another childs beloved fave  but then again anymore I go in expecting it to be bad and ruined so as to not be let down and shocked if its any good
Beyond stupid The worst movie ever Its pathetic
We watched it today  I loved it And my kids 58 years old loved it so much 
Its been a while since I watched what I consider a childs movie What I can say is good actors great scenes and actually enjoyable Production  and the little black actress is very talented  I guess Ill think about it twice when I see childrens movies
Wow ive never seen this many positive reviews I thought this movie will never be as good as Johnny Depps Willy Wonka but I guess well have to find out shall we there are alot of amazing actors though so I wont doubt the movie quality acting and the CGI
That actor is very overrated He def cant play Wonka
This one is good to be honest even the best as both wonka movies
"Talopaska
Kaisopomase"
When I think of whimsical this actor is the last person I think of Terrible actor for Dune as well
"Disappointing DEI horrible rendition of the original  Bring back the original with Gene Wilder  Willy Wonka was NOT a magician performing a magical fantasy  The original used real mechanical genius in his chocolate factory with oompa loompa workmen  The dog was fake most of the time  Story pushes the woke narrative to hate white men with one of the bad guys looking like a pale white Hitler  The white laundry couple with indentured slaves are the evil ones  Cops are corrupt and all the forced races everywhere is obvious wheres the white kid who wins the Golden ticket  And the Church and Christians are sinners

This is why I search back decades to watch movies and TV Ive missed that were written without ruining it by the cultural wars of today  All movies TV series streaming and entertainment is trash now due to this wokeness disease and why they have massive losses and layoffs we see today  Disney even admitted it this year in their earnings report  Skip this wokism and watch the original Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder 1971"
So Willy Wonka was a sane person from the startehm
It was a pretty darn good movie
dont be a hero but u r hero wb
Just came back from Vue Cinema and I went there to see Wonka and OMG it was the best movie I have ever seen PLS MAKE A DVD 
movie looks like it sucks
Honestly this is a good movie even when others seem to dislike it Its cute and it explains the way he is in the original and why he acts the way he does towards Charlie
Soooooooooo good Put your hand into your Pockolate get yourself some lovely Chocolate
"Every one after wonka came out its so   magical and great

Every one before oompa loompa doopity doo i got a baaaaaaaad feeling of you"
Every good thing in this world started with a dream so you hold on to yours This really touched me
Ppl who saw mrbean
"What a Wonkar Excellent acting and performances but the story was plain boring
"
I Actually Watched This Movie Today And It Was Amazing The Songs Are Literally Stuck Inside My Head
Is that mr bean
Run judgment is here Lol
Nothing will ever be as close to my heart as Johnny Depp playing Willy Wonka 
Should have been named Willy Woke Such an insult and theft of the work of Gene Wilders artful masterpiece
Your scarf is belong to Uzbeks tradition and products
This looks terrible
I didnt like it  I think the old one was better  But thats my opinion
Loved this movie Great for kids and adults
Yeah I love Willy Wonka
As an auditor I felt so connected with some plots in this film Only thing different is in the film the chartered accountant is virtuous and conscientious but in real life very often theyre part of the horrendous incriminating game Whats more appalling is since theyre conversant with auditing and accounting standards and related laws and regulations theyre adept at conducting misdeeds and getting benefits from it in a lawful fashion
This forced diversity is getting so annoying Isnt this movie supposed to take place in Europe Realistically there should only be white people in the cast

Hey there is Mr Bean Rowan Atikinson
                      
I liked Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka from 20 YEARS AGO better
Im going to see this in theaters tomorrow Im so excited  
She Wonka on my Willy till I chocolate bar
i thought it would charlie would be run the new wonka factory
will 4 year olds like this
Oh the symbolism IYKYK
Oliver Twist  Les Miserables  Boxtrolls  Charlie and The Chocolate Factory  Wonka
hugh grant oompa loompa was very yawn inducing but paterson joseph made a terrific villain and timothee chalamet is almost always fun to watch onscreen i dont think we need these remakes and i long for the day the studio system notices us tiring of them but this one wasnt the worst offender at all bonus points for panto olivia colman
Wait AMC has 5 movies every day They arent new releases but they have them
Hey Timothe Chalamet  Who cares about Wonka WTF happened to Dune  
Thats not the real Willie Wonka
I love it wonka trailer but still my favorite movie is charlie and the chocolate factory  such a speaking is true old is gold 
YES THERE IS ROWAN MY CHILDHOOD
lol
How embarrassing
"This was the second best version of Roald Dahls Wonka Character 
The first one was Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory 
I didnt care for the Johnny Depp version"
There is only one WWonka and it is Johny Depp
You had to be really high or really drunk if you said this movie was actually good Seems expectations for this movie was just too high First movie is 1010 but this movie some how managed to be 210 This is impossible if you consider that this is a wonka movie and could have been so much more This movie trys so hard to be a disney movie but fails in everyway Nothing but a money maker DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS GARBAGE
Its hard to believe that this Wonka is the same as Chocolate Factory Wonka This Wonka is very lively cheerful and so much positive energy If its gonna be a sequel please dont end it like JD Wonka
Is this film good for 8 year old
Went to see the movie today and much better than the last 2
Was a great great watch
WOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT PLACE TO START AND TO LEARN 
yall are making another one
Hi Willie wonka Im a big fan You can do me a favour  but im from
I miss how un excessive movies used to be
The kid Im babysitting is gonna watch the wonka movie
A pure joy and inspiration Never stop to imagine create and share with others  thats the message
Taking my kids For the kids  Typical Looks over Diversified And CGI through the roof
sorry but this looks horriblewhy do they bother making these classics over and over Dude is just not quite right to have the lead I dont think I would be able to get through it
Way better than I thought it would be Easily tramples all over that terrible 70s movie that spat on the source material easily on par with the 06 film

Keep them safe from harm all day long as much as you can 

By his presentation and his mannerisms
Do anything for him because hes a kind person"
Looks stupid
Hollywood is repeating itself with bad movies because making money is all they care about they can no longer develop or deliver decent content to the screen Im sick and weary of Willy Wonka Superman Batman the Avengers and everything
The new Wonka movie had outstanding actors and sets But it really had a poor script If youre going to make a movie based off an outstanding original it had better be sooo goooood I was bored through most of the movie until the last song The movie just wasnt magical at all It was like people trying to force a laugh
Willy Woke Wonka 
this movie was amazing in the theaters
I dont even like musicals but this movie was great Well written well directed and wholesome without even an ounce of wokeness This film is what Disney wishes it could produce Well done Warner Brothers 
Nice video
Watched it last night funny and very well edited designed
"This is sad
A tradie trying to score off a pro"
Tbh I like this movie a lot but i like johnny depps acting better it has a lot of humour in it and plot twists
Today I watched it and omg its so good and sad
"Is this a prequel
His back story seems different
The Johnny depp version hes a child of dermatologist
But in here hes just a peasant child
"
Watch this No political bullcrap and its actually a really good movie
Oompa Loompa Dupitt he do Ive got a tragic tale for you
Oompa Loompa Dupitt he do youve got a tragic tale for me
I cried like a baby in the For a moment sequence BEAUTIFUL film 
Hahaha his name is WILLY 
Great acting directing and yes Hugh Grant was the best  Fun movie 
Rowan Atkinsons Run Away A nod to Monty Python perhaps Please someone let me know
of course theres gonna be a black female sidekick
Thats a awesome
Great trailer
Boring movie I left theater after 30 minutes
Vou assistir por causa do namorado de kylie jenner
I really did not like the movie
Load of work nonsense
Kocham mog nawet by w tym filmie nadaje si
"Well I bought this thinking it would be good Turns out its absolutely packed full of musical renditions Its a bloody MUSICAL but nowhere in the trailers does it say this Theres rarely more than five minutes between one song finishing and the next one starting

If you dont like musicals BEWARE of this film"
Usually dont like remakes but I think this has potential

I Like Willy Wonka
Soooo good

 Wonka

Absolutely incredible
i dont care what critics and haters says I loved every single bit of this movie 3
The Visual effects in the movie were beautiful but the dialogue and everything else was terrible Sorry  the movie is not worth viewing even if the tickets were free
Is it just me or do one of the characters look like Hitler

Just watched at last and 2 things yes same dress as Gene Wilder storyline similar great to see actors like Rowan Atkinson the butler from downtown Abbey and a couple of others ommpa loompa man as I surprised the original loompa man already passed but still enjoyed it 
Just saw this movie and its one of the best movie theatre experiences I have enjoyed since Top Gun Maverick No woke agendas just great filmmaking and storytelling
It was a great movie 
We need Johnny depp
Hes so frickimg hot
this sucks
My little daughter and i enjoyed this movie  would watch it again  very cute and funny made We loved it
Nobody compares to Willy Wonka I would pay a limb to speak to him Entire cites would burst into song from his pure passion He made chocolate with utter sincerity and even an innocence Its restored the life in me Every piece of chocolate he made was a banger Wonka chocolatier connoisseur  cutie3
Timothe Chalamet is so charming in this movie those eyes I like the fact that they made Wonka less crazy but still not too serious Hugh Grant is perfect for an OompaLoompa lol Entertaining movie I love the message against corruption and the cartels of this world
Where can i watch it
I saw this movie In the Ceneplex cenimas and i HAD TO WATCH IT 10000001000000 best movie i ever WATCHED
Ugh nooo I was skeptical at the johnny depp remake but was pleasantly surprised can we just leave it at that and stop milking it
"Calah Lanes acting was atrocious

And the music was garbage If youre going to have a musical the music needs to be good This was just forgettable filler Reminded me of the lousy music in Mary Poppins 2 that was crammed inOverall 310"
Good movie
ok gzell
Im going on a date with myself to watch it a second time because I just loved this movie so much the first time
20mins in and Im good never asked for a musical
Super unexpectedly good wasnt rushed or forced like most modern movies everything was perfect loved the details from the original it left Made me full of creativity and hopeful like when I was younger
Movie sucked 05 out of ten
The little girl is a horrible cast she cant actpoker face 
Why are we continuing to ruin classic movies
Harika 
Very nice

I thought say she is a short wonka and his hair color is green 
Im glad the trailer gives away 90 of the movie
good movie i just didnt expect it to be so musicalafter the high standards of charlie and the chocolate factory
Good but cant beat Johny depp
bro the trailers have the best scenes
Beautiful movie we loved it 
I was quite skeptical but decided to give this movie a try Im glad I did It was good Great job with the story actors and actresses
144
IM ONLY WATCHING THIS MOVIE FOR TIMOTHE CHALAMET
what a load of wonk
I love this movie I watched and its amazing such a masterpiece
Just watched it It was such a fun movie but way too much singing and all the songs were pretty bad I know its a musical but this is too much 70 of the movie is filled with singing
The songs were very entertaining I loved scrub scrub
Oompa Loompa dont dibe do I got a bad feeling about you
chocopocalypse lol

Well I wouldnt want to have to fill Johnny Depps shoes either Cute movie for children though
  LA DODGERS  
This role was made for Michael Jackson
This trailer doesnt do it justice This movie is surprisingly good Of course if I knew it was a musical I probably wouldnt have watched it But boy am I glad that I did This movie is thousand times better than that Tim Burton stinker of a remake
A prequel that we didnt want but we loved 
"The Chocolate
Is a Metaphor
For Poetry
WOW 
"
I want a sequel
"Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant KeeganMicheal Key
Now thats a cast you wouldnt wanna miss"
The movie was actually a bit dark Way dark for a childrens movie

why tf this is musical
oompa loompa dobatedo i got at ragic tales for you
Its a good movie
Did I just see MrBeans
Why tf is he married to a diversity h1re Movies are ruined wake me up when we go back to reality
I loved it
I actually found it bad Sadly
This was a good film
I watched your show at the movie diesel Cause I begged my mom and jose yes
Easily top 5 of 2023 films
Literally had no idea this was a musical It was such a shame because I love a good musical but I just didnt think any of the songs were memorable
Why so much hate on this movie its actually beautiful
too young john goodman or keith david
I just loved the ending a pure homage to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory it was just brilliant and so colourful A modern take on the waterfall room in the original movie Just loved the whole movie and to repeat whats been said Hugh Grant a lovely and just brilliant Oompa Loompa No wonder it made so much money at the box office
Anyone seen the movie
"No Johnny Depp
Nah"
"OOMPA LOOMPA DUPADI DOO

I went to the movies yesterday and dang it I loved ittt 
Kkekskekekekkd
This is just a prequel
I was sooo skeptical with TRULY low expectations for this movie but it is So GOOD So fun Expectations blown out of the water
"People shited on the trailer but this movie is cute and cool
Like a feel good movie"
004 was a good scheme
Im finna go to  the movie theater to watch this 227
Hindi Dubbing plz upload 
A little bit of a dead trailer to be honest
Is this movie already out
Cool movie
Nothing can replace Johnny Depp wonkas movie
9 Highest Grossing film of all time 
Ok
I called my wife an Oompa Loompa she wont talk to me now
"Timothe Chalamet surprised me with his beautiful voice and charm this role suits him so well we even see glimpses of Johnny Depps Wonka in his mannerism he has a childlike spark in his eyes and his outfit is beautiful especially his coat 

Never thought Id see Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa but it was the most hilarious part of the movie and the song and dance really get stuck in your head 

Loved all the cast each one in their own unique way

The script was clever

The story was heartwarming

The musical numbers were so colorful and held the story together The songs also are easy to sing along to and memorable 

Sure there was much more cgi than practical sets which we miss seeing in the movies nowadays but nevertheless it was mesmerizing to see

You will also definitely crave chocolate after seeing it and someone should count how many times the word chocolate is said in the movie 

My IMBD rating is 910"
Cool The characters do look alikeSo is this supposed to be the story of how Wonka became the famous Wonka
Mr bbbbbbbbeeeeeaaaaannnnnnnnn
No johnny depp then movie is bulshit
Just saw it  Underwhelming
l   love   wanka    so    much
Watch it yesterdayand realize I should have tried to watch this movie in December  My god loved loved loved  What was your favorite scene  Mines was the balloons so magical 
Oompa loompa i dont know dude i got a bad felling about you
can we get a jonny deep 
Camilla the only fans girl is an inbred and smelly down there
The kids
I think the old people from the original movie
I would like if Johnny Depp did that role again I think it would just be somewhat amazing to the viewers
"Dear Casting department
This is NO Willy Wonka
This is like Billy Wonka a joke"
Too bad the trailer doesnt say anything about this movie being a musical but it was enjoyable to watch
Ruby gillman in Roblox Water park movie
Congratulations kid youve got a job based on your colour not cos of your talent Box ticking
Finally A movie about the history of diabetes and cancer This should be educational
This was actually a very good movie
I watched Charlie  the chocolate factory long time back now Im here 
I freeked out when I saw theword harry potter
Is that rowan atkinsonmr bean at 102
I never thought that I would be so excited watching this movie It seems that I became a child again my inner child had opened Its worth watching this movie especially when you watch it concurrently with your family
I like it
I like it
Saw this film today This definitely needs a sequel
I like the remake with Johnny Depp better
ok atleast this one doesnt look like it would traumatize a kid or a 11 year old
i wanted more focus on the ompa lompas
Way Lami
Why
This movie was sooo goooddo my word
I SAW MR BEAN
woow the trailer alone is a pain to go through imagine watching the entire movie
I couldnt even get through the trailer because of the bad cgi
Excuse me is it available on DVD BLU RAY  UHD 4K please
i started to watch this online on a movie site i hate going to the theaters its not that bad of a movie
They just ruined this whole movie for me
Please tell me Im not the only one who is blatantly pissed off that he says SCRATCH that instead of STRIKE that
I finally watched amazing 
IG as long as the normies are impressed jingles keys there you go
This is one of the few prequel movies that didnt make me dissapointed
ah finally got a disney movie from WB bros
I cried at the end not because of a happy ending but because Ive been watching Willy Wonka movie about aa hundred times and this sequel reminded me of my childhood
This was apart of all are lives now we get this  amazing and Im 30 and a male lol
"Telugu people feel proud after hearing the telugu film songs in Hollywood films

1 Wonka Chocolate above film"
Flop movid
""
the movie is too diverse i agree with that too much blackness  other than that is was really good
Disliked it left 20 mins into show 
This will either be absolutely fantastic or absolutely terrible I hope its the first one
 
And this is the origin of how Wonka chocolate factory
just watched this W movie
I got used to Johnny Depps version of Willy Wonka 
Is it available on DVD BLU RAY  UHD 4K please
It also works exactly like hotel in Willy Wonka
Dude was just phoning in wasnt even trying
Was that Mr bean
L MOVIE SUCKS
Nothing is better then the first one so good
I watched this with my wife and we really enjoyed it
no else noticed mr bean 140  143
Abc if u love love willy       by me a 9 year oldwonka and oompa looompas
The girl is black because shes a chocolate girl
Now this is how you do an film anniversary
Johnny better
It would be truly original if they pictured Wonka as the colonizer that exploited cocoa from the tropics and then boasts himself for making the best chocolate in the world
Why does the music at the start sound like a disney star wars movie
I saw your movie before where we Wonka
This film is shite worst film this year first 1 best ever Ive got a golden ticket
I wish I could have seen this
Such a shame that the film maker couldnt resist the clamour for nonsensical wokery
"Wasnt Wonka a serial killer 
Also how many Wonkas do we need This is the 3rd face already"
this movie was better than I expected dare I say best movie for the past year I have seen
Film was as bad as i thought
Just watched the opening of the film and now want to stab myself in the eyes with forks what utter rubbish who wrote the utterly rubbish songs the disney channel sorry cant put myself through this 
I think this is a future classic kids watching it now will grow up with this version of Willy Wonka and these new songs in their hearts Everyone involved did a fantastic job and its right up there with the best family films
So joyful to watch  I watched it with a big smile on my face made me so happy AND Im definitely craving chocolate
This smacks right dab in the middle of the other two movies with the original being on top of course but its still no small feat to surpass charlie and the chocolate factory The songs and jokes are also great extremely catchy and come with many different connotative meanings behind them Overall 8510
""
Yeet skirt is now doing a Wonka musical movie He came a long way LOL
This movie was great Im glad this actor guy got a role that he was perfectly suited for as I kind of hated him for Dune And it was super fun to see an origins story for this character Really wasnt expecting it to be this good usually when theyre milking established characters and making prequels and that kind of thing its terrible but they did a really good job here Could have had some slightly darker undertones to really drive it home but overall this was fantastic really enjoyable
Part 1 is KING
Saw the movie And WB has failed again Awful
A children movie with no LGBTQ 
"The begining  was nice the rest more like so so 80  of the scenes where much  too dark
Mr Bean appears there for 3 seconds just like in thie trailer Its not worth the money"
The trailer I viewed is fantastic Looks like an amazing watch From the costume to special effects set ect Beautiful  absolutely BEAUTIFUL How funn 227
So Tim youre afraid to put straight white guys aged 3050 who arent stupid Well then Tim Well were boycotting your next movies Tim Love Tim
This should be Johny Deep movie they had no rights to remove actors from film industry and affect billions of peopleswhat kind of stupid pathetic punishment is thatThey are pathetic
more diversity garbage
People who watched Charlie and the chocolate factory 
Somebody told me the movie wasnt that good it was strange out here
Fell asleep half way through please dont waste your time watching this if you like the Johnny Depp version this is a complete barf show make new movies please stop remaking classics and completely ruin it for people who actually enjoy real acting
I just saw Mr Bean
Woke
I just booked for Tuesday to go to Willy Wonka too
just watched the movie today and i absolutely loved it so very much  its officially in my top 3 fav movies of all time along with the matrix and it remake  what a magical experience they really did capture the essence of what it means to pursue your dreams and make them come true  it reminded me very much of my childhood self and the dreams ive held on to all this time and just how important it is to keep trying u just might change the world
Another woke disaster No thanks
there are websites that tells you if a movie is woke or not and why not watching this garbage
The movie is more Disney than Disney itself
Trash
I was totally disappointed after watching this movie 2 out of 10 
The worst movie DOH should step up to ban this movie It promotes unhealthy habits Look at  that one guy it become obsessed  
Really enjoyed this movie and Timothee and Hughs performance 
Just finished watching it And what can I say but I am inlove with this movie I now love Timothee Chalamet
His so hot
Huh I wasnt moved Cute but rediculous
To be honest its a great movie for Adults I just saw it and tbh it open my mind of thinking outside the box Best recommend movie to watch if you want to have ur own business or put it this way a Entrepreneur 
This is beautiful 1010 I could taste the mood the movie give wonderful  this  is amazing beautiful thank you to the creator yall just sparked my imagination 
honestly it looks pretty bad
Wonka I put my thing down flip it and reverse it
charle chocalate factory
the new Characters is willy Wonka 
This kids good after Dune Ill watch anything hes in
Loved it 
A dazzling array of perverts grotesques gluttons and miscreants An allegory for the filth of capitalism drowning the world in sewage and the delusions of liberals who believe they can tame this monstrosity The horror is real and visceral
"yawnermwhich part of the book is this 
smh"
Has any one noticed that most rising stars in Hollywood are of one religious group Has anyone noticed that all they do is help each other and work against everyone who is not part of their group Its amazing to me that while millions are struggling to enter this industry its the ones who are part of this group who are given an advantage This needs to stop were all just letting it happen I never understood till I realized that Timothee Chalamet Dune Wonka etc is part of that group
An insult to Gene Wilder
Jonny depp this already much better
stupid musical I was so looking forward to this but the musical side of it ruins the whole atmosphere of being magical the old movie is much better and no stupid singing
Should of been Johnny Depp
Wait is this Musical
Not a good movie  Unsatisfied 
The plot is a giant mess and this is easily the worst portrayal of Willy Wonka Chalamets worst job yet I thought the songs  everything technical besides the special effects and lip syncing were good though
I feel like Im supposed to like this but tbh the trailer bores me
Chocolate maker Chocolatier is what you meant
good movie
Lets replace the chocolate in this movie with drugs and everything starts to make sense
Ill be honest this movie looks horrible Im just now finding out this was a new movie too 
Boring
doesnt look as good as the last one
looks dumb
So incredibly ghaaaaaaaay
"I didit
It didin work"
I saw mr bean 
Beyond awful
I give it a 2 out of 10 Great actor Definitely captured the heart of a dreamer and he was the only wonderment of the whole thing The storyline of the scrub lady and the other chocolatiers ruined the movie It was the main focus and that was a huge problem for me No memorable songs The big reveal of the factory was too digitalized and nothing wow Hugh Jackman was funny I feel like any true fans of Wonka could have written a better storyline I was beyond disappointed in Charlie and the chocolate factory because even though Johnny Depp is my absolute favorite his character was forcibly awkward Definitely showed how it was more like the book though and the scary aspect shined through but his character was more annoying if anything and didnt capture the real dark ess it should have This prequel to how the factory came to be should have been better The songs should have been more magical and powerful I mean its about the build up to pure imagination All the magic came from Timothee Chalamet yes but they should have focused more on him Not the scrub lady and other chocolatiers trying to ruin him That should have been a one and done and on to the next Wont watch again
i thought the other remake was bad but this is horrid
No asians or Hispanics why only add blacks to white movies
Are all these comments fake They are all the same Saw this movie yesterday blah blah blah
Bad
My childhood 0
THAT LOOKS SO STUPID
This guy is a Zionist that supports genocide
There is only one wonka Johnny deep
The number of fake good reviews in this comment section is insane
This looks like its going to be terrible
It was very good I wached it 
I DIDNT EVEN KNOW THE WONKA MOVIE EVER EXISTED
aaaaaaa
141 Mr bean

Is that mrbean as a pope
"006 and Im something of a crushersimp
006 and Im something like a crushersimp"
Wi  be making it to the theatres with this one
Just saw this movie yesterday and it was fantastic There was more singing that I thought thered be but it was seamlessly integrated and never took you out of the story The effects and references were perfect and truly made for an excellent origin story of Wonka An absolute joy to watch especially for chocoholics
MR BEAAAN
Gross Timothy is just playing himself whilst saying the lines garbage movie idea
millennial humor the movie
A boring film to start with a surprisingly heart warming ending For an origin story it wasnt really that interesting  the acting was millennial though the best acting comes from the Ompa Lumpa Never a dull moment when the Ompa Lumpa was on screen Over all even with a heart warming ending I wasnt impressed would of rather scene a story involving Wonka and the Ompa Lumpa Save your money  watch the Ompa Lumpa scenes online
Wow you     are    the   Best 
Bold move to remake Willy Wonka in downtown Detroit
I saw the movie yesterday  Not bad just wish I knew it was a musical
This movie was absolutely wonderful So creative and respectful to the original film The dancing the music everything was fantastic
I saw it yesterday and I left the theater sobbing because it was so beautiful and sweet no pun intended
Shouldnt a musical be advertised as a musical
Love this movie
I just came here to see how many token black characters were now going to be forced into the movie
Loved it kids loved what a great movie
Im going to watch this in the theater today yay
his gf is Kylie Jenner In irl
OMG IS THAT ACTOR WHO I THINK IT IS
047 he looks so silly 
I really loved Timothee Chalamet in this movie he sang Pure Imagination really well

Gerekten mkemmel bir sezon tebrikler 
I saw this movie in theaters and it was AWSOME
"Nicely done but nothing better than Johnny Depp
Im sorry"
Thank you for destroying the original Willy Wonkas image I always had I never liked this fellow with the french name and now I like him even less
Mr bean
I love Charlie and the chocolate factory Tbh everything that Roald dhal has ever written is amazing And to see exactly how Willy became Wonka is amazing Its like a back story of the original yknow though this time it has nothing to do with Charlie
never realized half the uk were black in Victorian days
I have been to the 
"Timothy is such a natural actor he has a career for life My daughter adores his acting and loved Little Women as did I She could not stop talking about this film when she went to the Cinema with her Dad I am looking forward to seeing it at home Bravo
 "
Ahh hope this is more fuel for my favorite fan theory of wonkapiercer
"I didnt checked that this is a musical and I had a really hard time in the cinema absolutely hated this movie

U gotta be a reaaaally big musical fan to be able to enjoy this movie"
sorry but that was not good left a cinema after an hour or smth
It was necessary to make a new one
Hey laxybox how are you today Im sending you on Wednesday morning ayo new movie wonka its lit 
Trash
Not bad
Way too much dark chocolate in this movie Pass Shame it started off as something Id watch
yk the movies good when you come back to watch the trailer
Everything about this movie is perfect Only i think tim as wonka is too pretty 
I did not like the movie much however the trailer was EPIC
No one beat Johnny depp whatever actor comming this character only suits Johnny depp  Willy Wonka
These ommpa looks amazing the Johnny depp one was terrible colorful and this looks like a older time just like original
This one looks better then that Johnny one this 1 has nostalgia and looks older te
Why do this if ur going to do it so the glass elevator one the Johnny depp one was already creepy nothing like orofinal
So the title of the movie is Wonka which we all know is about his incredible Chocolate Factory but the factory opens halfway through the movie and then goes out of business all in the blink of an eye Then the movie goes off on a tangent about a little girl named Noodles who cannot find her mom but then does Another woke moviefailexcept for Hugh Grant who played the Oompa Loompa Well done Hugh
"Just saw it
What an awesome story and so well done
Deserves an Academy Award"
Ive watched the movie
""
in this movie it have best actress and it have amazing  funny moments at all i love this movie
The only problem I had w this film was casting Timothy as wonka His energy was off for this character
Watched this yesterday Was a Treat Triggered nostalgia 
Where can I watch this
Why does the actor that plays Willy Wonka look like Jacob Frye from Assassin Creed Syndicate
I saw this movie a few days ago and it was so good i especially loved Noodle and Willys bond
I loved this but his singing was so relaxing I kept dozing off bc I was so comfortable lol
what is the title of the background music i think its a classical music used in this trailer
Its like the perfect combination of Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder
he is cute
a giraffe is crazy
wheres Johnny Depp
Timothe Chalamet is my new fav actor
Here we go mama hits hard
No
Fantastic movie enjoyed by our entire family
I think it looks boring
Seen it not gonnna lie great movie really enjoyable family film 
Anyone else thinks the this is the handsomes Willy Wonka of all no just me
I thought the movie was pretty good  I was pleasantly surprised and it was enjoyable The singing isnt overdone and the numbers are short I liked the sets the costuming  the cast  and the imagination The CGI was fitting The story was entertaining  highlighted with some comedic elements It was nostalgic to watch a new movie about Wonka  I would rate it a 910   
No thanks
"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory where my two favorite movies growing up 
I actually got a bit emotional during the movie because it felt like i had the chance to see those movie i loved for the first time again"
imagine staring in a movie with TIMOTHEE CHALEMET
Its better than the Johnny Depp one but doesnt really have the pull Gene Wilder managed
ive not seen this its bad i hate it and it should stop because is say so 
Everything in this factory is edible just maybe stay away from whatever has peaches in it
this movie was so much better than i anticipated im ready to watch it again 
I LOVED HOW ITS WAS SAD BUT TURNED AWESOME AT THae END But why did you destroy his shop
"I watched it and it was way different than I thought I hate to say it but I kinda liked it 
Its not like the other Willy wonks movies"
Seen this today and i must say too much singing they had a song ever 10 mins other than the music it was fine though i would not recommend it
I find it baffling that pretty much the entire cast is British but doing american accents Why not just set it in England like the other wonka movies Would make more sense Unless it is but somehow they all have American accents anyway
this movie was so good but i kinda wish i didnt watch it bc now i have a crush that i cannot stop thinking about 
Kendall is happy
this was the best movie ive ever watched i really recommend it

I watched this in a movie theater its my FAVORITE MOVIE ITS SO GOOD BRO ITS TO GOOD
What a fine establishment
But why the guy from call me by your name
I love this movie so good
Tooo much singing overall great film The one line i love was once we sing itll get stuck in your head Yeah lets hot do that Too late once we start we cant stop
Wonkas Horrible Histories the Six Idiots and various other UK actors Worth it just to see Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson
Cheeseburger theres no cheeseburger only chocolate
So my Mandela effect is I swear the 70s version was called Charlie and the chocolate factory With the Jonny version being Wonkas chocolate factory 
"People say that the older version is better but it is a really bad comparison since both movies concentrate on different climaxes of Willys life If you loved the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder then you will absolutely love this version of the movie Though if you have mommy issues unfinished dreams you gave up on or feel as if you have no sense of direction to where your going in life this will make you bawl 

you have been warned"
 
Oompa lompas look like my brother
Congratulations Timoothe
Nostalgia movie but this is very amazing
"WOWZERS  With all the positive awesome comments I absolutely have to see this movie now Never really been into the musical thing  but from what everyone else is saying about the show I think its time I change my opinion on musicals and cant wait to see this 
Thanks everyone for the great comments youve all changed this guys mind lol"
Every 5 mins was a musical like show more of the movie
Wanka
I just watched the movie
I have been summoned

Welcome to the ChocoIndustrial Complex Kevin
I dont want to know Wonkas origin story Im good with Gene Wilders version
My review Take the o from wonka and throw it away as it is no longer needed Now take the a and put it in the place that the o has vacated To summarise I didnt like it 1 The 1 is for Hugh Grant as he was the only redeemable thing in this awful film
It was really cringe and had a painful soundtrack sad to see such a great opportunity waisted it had nothing related to the real Willy Wonka and the original story
Its a 1010 it has mr bean
what is this
Willy Wonka from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
"145 
Every Good thing in this world started with a dream So you hold onto yours

Here we go Momma"
is it in Netflix
"gOoD mOrNiNg StArShInE tHe WoRlD sAyS hElLo 
Willy Wonka Johnny Depp"
Any movie that comes out now is woke no more good movies its so disappointing what this world has become
please make a sequel with timontheill pay
Seriously the worse movie Ive seen in years
Im sure its better than the Johnny Depp version as that movie scked big time
Saw Wonka this evening with my family and to say we enjoyed every minute would be a understatement  This remake of has finally lived up to the original and I truly hope they make a sequel with Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka
Why are Wonkas childhood shown differently in the two films I mean why in Burtons film did he live with his father and here with his mother
It feels like he is imitating Johnny Depp a bit
      
Gonna watch this in the movies for my birthday Im so excited
Unpopular opinion this was one of the worst movies I have seen Then again it is a movie for children
Good
"Took the kids to see it over Christmas i was not expecting much and I was blown away Its so much fun i think we are going to go back and see it again tomorrow  

Would highly recommend it"
The trailer skips from clip to clip so quickly moves fast like a simulation curious why the new movies move so quickly check out the difference between this and the original movie
I just saw this movie with my thirteen year old daughter We both loved it Thank you Hollywood for keeping it family friendly No woke nonsense Best movie Ive seen for a long time It reminded me of the old Hollywood cinema excellence
Timothe was literally made for the role of Willy
EXCELLANT movie 
Watched this and absolutely loved it
Worst boring movie i have ever seen
this is my favorite movie now i watched it like 10 days after it came out and its absolutely AMAZING
this movie was really nice 455 i didnt know it was a musical but I loved it not the best fan of musicals
Doesnt look very good
The movie really sucked not for kids  To much singing No action I would think it would build to something but it didnt
Just not into the lead actor just doesnt have the PIZZAZZ
This was much better than I expected 910
This is my favorite movie ever when it comes out for streaming yall should be afraid of me
I got an idea
Hate the movie and hate the actor
Im so sad mr beast was corrupt 
Come with wonk and well wonk in a wonk of pure imagination take a wonk and youll wonk in a pure imagination
MR BEASTTT
"lmao blacks everywhere
They are so ugly stop it"
ooga booga
I just watched the full movie and its actually really good 
I watched this film last night it is magical I liked every bit of it a lot
Lame
this movie was so good
Hugh Grant Rowan Atkinson and Timothee Chalamet Done deal This movie was FANTASTIC magical and charming I went and saw it twice LOL
Brilliant film  Timothe Chalamet is fantastic as Wonka  Its such a colourful entertaining witty film packed full of great songs and performances  It definitely gave me classic musical vibes like Mary Poppins Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  Well worth watching  5 stars
This Willy Wonka doesnt seem traumatized enough Im sry Wont watch it 
A beautiful heart warming musical feel good movie for the whole family that I can only recommend and I will watch it again and again 
I hate wonk Wonk is so amazing I love wonk and i wonk to be his buddy
Why does Hollywood keep beating a dead horse
When wonk and wonk went to wonk factory I was sooooooo happy and when wonks dad sir wonk he was so hot
My favoruite part was when Wonka said its Wonking time and Wonked all over the place
Wonk
Wonk
"Come with me and youll be in a world of pure imagination
I just saw Wonka last night and I really enjoyed the film Had heart magic and Timothee Chalamet was perfectly cast as Willy Wonka
Cool to see the origins of the candy making genius and how he got his start"

I Just saw trailer wonka movies
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
Saw this in theatres yesterday let me tell you this is way better then the original Its more of a twist and olden time feelings The dancing singing setting and concept of the story is chefs kiss 
It was good but does anyone else think the other 2 are better
I saw it December 16th and I loved it something like 110 
Uhhh You guys are actually looking forward to this Ruined a classic
its like a Breaking Bad movie but in a more polite way
nothing to see here just a lot of people defying the laws of gravity
The trailer doesnt do this movie justice it is a MUST SEE
This movie was simply awful 010 dont go see it
Daniel Thrasher is playing as Willy Wonka now
"Just saw this film 
Its adorable and I hope lots of people go see it so we can have more films like this"
Here we go Mama 
Really great movie
I wrnt to see it today I was amazed how good this is so good give ir 10 out 10
Simpleton writing surface acting and a generic plot Whats the fuss about
What did they do to wonka why is he so silly and dumb this is meant to be a prequel so its important to do the character correctly  they didnt even get the quotes wrong
I Love it 
A absolutely love Paddington so have high hopes for this 
This film really exceeded my expectations it was just so sweet and heartwarming 
Timothee chalamet le da un toque muy hermosa a la pelcula
I Just Saw this MovieIt was Beautiful Perfectly writtenI grew up with the Original Charlie and the Chocolate factoryI GiveUp
i am going to see this because it has timothee chalamet
I saw this movie tonight it was garbage it wasnt that cool or good it was trash I wouldnt watch it again theres way way better movies to watch like sound of freedom john wick I love watching john wick because the action is good and john wick is a cool badass guy baba yaga john wick yeah yeah yeah 
MRBEANNNN
2022
Good movie too much singing
Literally nobody asked for this
I thought this was gonna be another remake of willy wonka the Original Movie but this is how willy wonka became Wonka I guess the  wonderful bizzare Candy company back in the 1900
Very cute movie with gorgeous scenes The acting is incredible Timothee plays a really good Wonka This movie had lots of heart and made me cry a few times I give this movie about a 7510 In my opinion I do like the original Gene Wilder the most its the best one for me And I also like the Johnny Depp one Of course I like this one But nothing can compare to the original one in my opinion
This movie was trash 
The plot was really boring in my opinion
I just saw the movie and it was genuinely one of the best Ive seen let alone a prequel to a many year old original
This movie looks amazing I cant wait
Great movie even greater message 
I watched today like a few hours ago in cinema and I love it
THEATRE FANS WHO WENT JUST TO SEE MILLIE IN THE 3 SECONDS SHE WAS IN IT
""
Thanks to the customers for such a      masterpiece 
It was good but which one was the best the first one with gene wilder or second one with Johnny depp or third one with Timothy chalamet
"perfect movie 
best musical movie i ever seen
timothee chalamet amazing perfomances
highly recommending this movie 
watch now"
I wish they would stop
"This movie was really good
The plot line was great 
The characters were funny
Just a little flaw was that the acting could be a little bit better
Than it would be perfect
But overall
Pretty good movie"
Will this be available on Netflix
I love Willy Wonka
I watched it today
Im so proud of Daniel Thrasher for finally having a major role on the big screen 
Saw Wonka today and it is excellent
In love with this movie
Someone should Sue this producer You dont make a third Willy wonka The second one already sucked the first 1 was the best Dont remake s a third time
100 thumbs down
"This Movie Is So TRASH compared to Johnny Depps 
Unbelievable how Depp can turn Any Role Out in front of him into An Iconic Character"
Is it only me who think he is cute 
Timothy is outstanding at theater acting he is also such a relaxed good actor
Its a very excellent movie just seen it super good
Ayo is that ma boi lil mabu
Looks boring
Wasnt expecting much yet it was amazing Loved every second
1995 to 2010 can only understand the feelings
not bad not great would specially recommand it
Timothy you bet not snitch in jail for what you did too KYE I got some latins in there on PayPal payroll n Im calling meechie Miko suavey
I saw this on Saturday it was beautiful 
Its like ennola holmes
So basically he goes from becoming a very nice and inspirational person who has a dream to make amazing chocolates to a cold and heartless person who doesnt care about family and stuff
Who else was surprised when the figured out it was a musical lol 
I miss johnny depp Bro timothee is kinda average acting in wonka  I dont like it
Didnt like it that much can never compare to Gene wilders version
Good thing they didnt use a little person for an oompaloompa Wouldnt want to employ one of those and have the dinklage rage
Good thing theres a female POC to help him out
Is that Daniel thrasher
Willy Wonka Im your biggest fan I love u Im your biggest fan 
Now with Africans dressed in English period clothing Lets just pretend they were a thing 
Willy Green and Weed Factory the sequel 
No bc  Lucas Jade Zumann would slay this role
Just saw it today   It was alright Meh   It looked like they couldnt decide if they wanted to do a Wonka backstory  or the next Bond film or a remake of Mary Poppins or a remake of Les Miserables then decided to just borrow from all of the above   They certainly didnt make a lot of effort on original music  The only memorable tunes were the melodies from the original 1971 film with Gene Wilder
I loved this movie so much 3 It was so sweet and I almost cried 3 times while watching it
This was so much better than we all expected
always have put black in there cant just leave things be
This movie is better than Disney movies all of them 
"When i heard this was coming out i couldnt believe theyd go from Johnny Depp to Timothee Johnny was made for the role of an eccentric Willy Wonka how could the downgrade like this 
But i was very impressed and genuinely loved this movie Timothee was perfect for a flowering Willy Wonka just beginning to grow into his oddball character "
Im gonna go see it today Im so excited aaaa
WONKA is a STONKA some people  well it seems a lot are easily pleased by this rubbish Terrible interpretation of a classica boring and unfunny with unmemorable songs  bad casting  apart from the Coleman and Grant I brought my friends three kids to see and they started shifting and yawning after 20 min Instead of exciting the senses this Movie numbed the senses It put me of going to Cinema and eating chocolate for a while
Next time we see a Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory sequel with Matin Short as the old Wonka 
Wonka was watched in theaters a second time this time with my Mom and my opinion remains the same
"Apparently Im the only one that didnt like the movie totally moved away from the original orgin story for wonka it just didnt have the magic of the older ones or maybe im just a grinch

Also character development wasnt the best I cant imagine this movie being rewachable"
I loved the movie it might even be my personal favorite of 2023 One thing I thought could be interesting is a Charlie and the Chocolate factory remake with Timothee Chalamet It could be with the charm and feel of the Gene Wilder movie but a more accurate adaptation Maybe some bits and pieces of the Johnny Depp movie but aside from being mostly accurate to the book it isnt very magical I liked it and was happy it was closer to the book but that movie was very weird But a mixture of all adaptations and the book itself starring Timothee would be an awesome movie
This was actually good
What is that Mr BEAN
This was such an amazing experience to see
This movie was such a delight I absolutely loved it and cant wait to see it again
The cameos 
He gets younger every movie
The film is great the main character was not great
Wonkas origin story  this looks lame asf
This movie is truly magical  enchanting   delightful  Its  an unexpected story  the trailer gives nothing away actually  brilliantly acted with great characters 
This is very bad
"Just saw it amazing work
Enjoyed it so much 
Thank to everyone who made this possible"
I was so excited to see this but sadly it was awful The songs werent good the storyline was terrible it wasnt a prequel to the willy Wonka movie Just a real disappointment
so well written heartwarming very beautiful
156 High kicks there
"Ive left the cinma  it was fantastic and exactly what I needed to feel good 
Timothee is a natural Wonka and Hugh Grant as Ompaa is funny than ever"
Pile of garbage     Bunch of fake comments on this trailer   lol look at all the fake names 
I loved this movie I really want to go back to the theater and watch it again soon
Insanely bad The plot is just poorly written and the dialogues are plane stupid Cant believe horrible movies like that make it to the public
I love the part of the movie where wonka deadpans I need your clothes your boots and your motorcycle
Espectacular Wonka pelcula clsica medieval de ilusin y fantasa x un sueo difcil de encontrar
Im all for it but kind of wish Willy Wonka was cast using Eddie Redmayne Rami Malek adam driver or tom holland
Best wonka movie ever I hate the 2005 with Johnny deep that was the worst
MR BEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
npi how many times are yall gonna remake the same movies over again by this time u guys should just do broad way spectacles
I remember the first one I saw at my school
Nahh I saw this movie gosh it was kinda good
Absolutely adore this movie Completely enchanting 1010
Good 
i saw this in the theater it was ABSOLUTELY AMAZING I LOVED IT and 1010 recommend you should see it
Ive watched this twice now in two days this side of 2023 I feel Ill watch it again in 2024 Its a brilliant funny lighthearted film and i think Gene Wilder would have loved it Best feel good movie so far 
The movie was just amazing
The actor support Zionis
Disney vibes
This movie was a complete let down I went against my better judgment even though deep down I already knew that if they werent even creative enough to write their own movie  then they are definitely incapable of even being on par with what they copied 010
lol
THEY RUINED WILLY WONKAHOW SAD
Hugh Grant was great as a Oompa loompa we needed more of him He was so funny Timothe Chalamet as Wonka was fine enough fairly zaney and quirky Olivia Coleman great as usual There was  some genuinely funny moments but just as I was getting into the story they broke out into a song about every 2 or 3 minutes   I wouldnt mind if it was Julie Andrews who carried great melody and some good songwriting backing it but the songs were bland apart from the Oompa loompa doompety doo song which Hugh Grant nailed Timothe Chalamet didnt have a nice voice so he butchered pure imagination he aint no Gene Wilder I think overall its a good fill and silly movie that most people will enjoy it just wasnt my cup of tea
Terrible movie Too much singing the acting was not good I only finished the movie because we paid 40 do not go see
I dont know but not like Jonny dep
This is my favorite movie
025 wtf lmao
Its not the same without jhonny depp
Just saw this yesterday Love it
Oh this movies my favorite Ive seen that movie into theaters
"Loved the movie Based on the trailer the only hint that its a musical are brief snippets of choreography Same with The Color Purple and Mean Girls 
I long for the days when musicals could be advertised as musicals"
This film is absolute trash DO NOT WATCH
"I never really cared for Timothee Chalomet and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is okay This looks good but it bothers me that he was recently in that cannibalistic movie Bones and All that had a trailer that would play on YouTube Maybe if I can forget about that Ill watch it 

I bet theaters love this movie because theyll sell lots of candy"
Where is the bob at
I loved Willy Wonka and was so happy to know this would be out Timothee played Willy so incredibly He brought the funny sweet and kind character too life
Looks like trash
This movie was a lovely surprise Really nailed the feeling of classic musicals oozing with whimsy and charm Sure the CGI was a bit rough at times but the overall package was much better than it had any right to be Clever writing with wordplay and callbacks catchy new songs and solid performances Definitely justified its existence and then some Bravo
He shouldve done the Wonka voice
They should do a sequels teaching teens and adults have to be wise like the original children
Actually looks like a sweet film Im a little happier with 2023 cinema
I just watched this movie and its pretty good
Hugh Grant stole the show
Simply beautiful
wokea
Wanka
Completed misleading
Poor throws up
Day dreaming penalty
Its nice to see that actors of paddington and the director of paddington came together in this movir to
Id like to know how the chocolate factory was moved from an ocean town to a town thats no where being near an ocean
no willy wonka song 
This was the movie we wanted and needed Something magical innocent and imaginative A world of pure imagination 
Timmy did wonderful Love the movie
Watched it today Perfect family movie 
How is it possible that a preHispanic drink from the cultures of Mesoamerica became so appreciated by Europeans
""
MR BEAN  MR BEAN MY FAVOURITE YAYAYYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYYAYAYAYAYAAAAAAAAAAAAa
Im a fan of new generation actors but when all the characters are getting by Shalomy is not right There are many actors who can also   play and recognized
This was an awesome movie to watch the music dancing and the special effects added to the story which is rare Usually movies need the special effects to enjoy the movie which is why they fail The main characters did a great job bringing this movie to life
lost me at musical
I watched this movie and it was amazing I almost felt like the zookeeper highly energetic and excited No way I cant hope for this to end up as a franchise
Saw this film yesterday in theaters and it was amazing  Its perhaps the best film I saw post 2020
Who knew Willie Wonka was so FINE 
"043 He looks exactly like Daniel Trasher in that moment
any way this movie is amazing I would say 910 points  I really recommend it"
atleast they used a dwarf nor like snow white and the seven dwafs remake
Going to see it today
Disliked
Fantastically Delicious Took my two boys to see it today and it was fantastic Timothee Chalamet definitely deserves an Oscar for his performance Gene Wilder would be proud
This was a fantastic movie in the middle of this sick society Take your kids and family
This movie is fun
So happy willy Wonka doesnt have  a phony English accent
Wtf in the original book Willy Wonka is Carribean Roald Dahl must be turning in his grave
Going to watch Wonka this afternoon at Cannock cinema in Staffordshire so fingers crossed its going to be good
Old version is better 
Let me save some people 2 hours The most boring film I have ever seen in my 35 years The film made no point whatsoever One of the worst remakes ever do not waste your time Hopefully I saved a few of you  and as for the lead wow Shocking casting
Disgustingly bad entrepreneurs Corruption in the police and a rapacious church You already know all this not only in Wonka 
If Willy was poor how could he afford to make such extravagant chocolate
I did not watch any trailers beforehand and I had no clue it was a musical
Does anyone think they did way too much with KeeganMichaels character
what different of willy wonka johny deep 2005 with wonka 2023
Does anyone else think they did way too much with Keegans character
I just saw this movie and I enjoyed it a lot
Just saw it today it was so good
Just got done seeing it honestly it was incredible Do not know why Timothee is getting hate He did great
Where in the hells our Wonka Bars Ferrara candy better have a good explanation of how they missed this golden opportunity
Look at all these bots commenting with the standard generic statements it was so good loved it amazing etc Absolutely zero depth and anyone with a properly functioning brain can see right through its transparency
Just watched it an hour ago was SO AWESOME 
Absolutely loved this movie 
Man everything these days needs to be so fastpaced and flashy Nothing like the original
I still wish they would make a sequel to the original where Charlie and his grandfather run the factory Maybe after his grandfather dies Charlie gets lonely and gives out golden tickets looking for an apprentice I feel like that would be more interesting than a Wonka origin story But hey ill give them props for not rebooting the original and showing some creativity
This looks interesting I still wish they would make a sequel to the original where Charlie and his grandfather run the factory Would Charlie be obessed with chocolate making like Wonka or would he run it a different way Maybe after his granfather dies Charlie becomes very lonely and decides to give out golden tickets But hey at least they didnt remake the same movie im glad theyre doing something different
Tim Chalamet isnt a very good actor
I seen Mr bean omg
I loved it but expected a little more nuts on this young Wonka
Is it good
Plastic
This IS New Right Like This Is Incredible OMG and de flowers are planting and de  water was water cream chocolate  This is still de best movie
There is a real bro Aaron 4ther is still worken inan motto
Utah weed was one of my famous not hot but cert
Id like to see Timothee as mrtumnus from narnia if there was a remake lol
Am I the only one who has a crush on the actor of Willy Wonka in this movie
Just saw this movie in theater yesterday it was AMAZING The music and the dancing mixed together really moved me and almost brought me to tears I have to say  It really felt out of this world
so disappointed the character of willy wonka is played by this talentless man
This is the type of must watch during school days after exam papers
There was a lot of singing in this movie Something I dont like in movies But this one was different I loved it
Movie was SO good
205 Lord Farquaad
The movie was great but every time I saw him I was reminded of his Hamas joke which greatly contrasted with the goodnatured Wonka that he played so I was less immersed
THE  FILM  IS  ABSOLUTELY  D E L I G H T F U L   I   SAW   IT  AT  THE  WEEKEND   AND  IT  IS   A  HEART WARMING  PLEASING  CHARMER  OF  A  MOVIE      The lead guy Timothy did a fabulous job in the role of Wonka    10
I just watched this today and it was spectacular I also went into this movie not knowing it was a musical it was a nice surprise
I loved everything about this movie
Really funny really enjoyable kind of magical I absolutely loved it
I just watched this movie and it was great Absolutely loved it
I am seeing this
Watched it last night Made me cried and smiled so wide when Pure Imagination came in What a perfect holiday movie so magical  heartwarming my innerchild is so so happy
The moment I read harry potter i just knew this will be good
And it sucked
Why does this trailer make zero hint at the fact that this is a musical
It was an awesome movie
At times the voice of Willy has an elevated tone which makes it difficult to understand There are some cross references in themes to other classical works Does anyone know is this a book I would love to read it
Well worth watching Has a lot of relevant lessons Has familiar secondary characters like Rowan Atkinson 
OMG MR BEAN IN IT TOO
Warning shittest movie of 2023 it was like high school musical but with a weird twist of Wonka 
142 Rowan Atkinson MrBean spotted 
Went and saw this movie its not great
Everyone should be aware the they are filtering criticism and any type of negative comments Dont bother with a company that cant even make a decent movie
This was a stupid movie Even my kids wanted to get out of the theatre It is a musical with I think 20 songs if you hate musicals dont watch it
Couldve been a different actor
Ill stick with the old wonka it went wrong very bad blow 100
What is Hollywoods endless fascination with this stupid movie
I grew up reading Roald Dahl books and loved the original movie so I was worried that I would be disappointed No reason to worry  This movie is magical
Movie is terrible so much singing its shockingly bad
I just saw this movie today and it is quite a fun and entertaining musical
I watched the movie today and it is probably one of the best movies i have watched i love all the cast choices and songs
I thought Id hate this movie I left in tears The ending was magical Amazing movie
Excellent production
amazing movie
If you have not seen this movie and want to watch it GO AND WATCH IT It was such a beautifully written story and the characters and cast was so amazing You will LOVE this movie It made mine and my familys Christmas Eve so special
Glad I watched the trailer before blindly going and seeing wouldve been a huge mistake
Wonka is my hero
One of the best movies Ive ever seen Going to see it again tomorrow
Im a simple girl I see reggie i watch the movie
Was that Mr Bean saying run away
never laughed so hard during a movie this movie was so funny
The dark white nutty absolutely insane part is so hot 
Mr bean reference
I LOVE THE MUSIC AND EVERY MOVIE WITH AMAZING MUSIC AND GIVES ME GOOSEBUMPS I ALWAYS WILL WANNA WATCH IT
Now i shall make edits of this movie
Rowan Atkinson
This movie is criminally overhated
I am tired of the representation matters thing
Loved this film from start to the end
Please oh please let there be no message Please dont destroy Wonka like snow white star wars and just about everything these days
Me and my wife saw this to see what the big fuss was about and how everyone raved about it Neither one of us cared for it which alot of are friends thought we were crazy While is was okI dont plan on watching it again anytime soonif ever
Freakin fantastic Loved every minute of it  Best movie Ive seen in years
"The new Young Willy Wonka seems more like a mixture of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depps Willy Wonkas than just being a specific one of them
For example Young Wonkas outfit seems more like Gene Wilders Wonka with the hat and the bright uniquely patterned shirt but the general colour scheme of his outfit such as his coat looks more like Johnny Depps Wonka
Timothe Chalamets Wonka also doesnt wear gloves This is similar to Gene Wilders Wonka but it could also be because when he got older he wore gloves to look more professional or perhaps to hide the injury scars he got in his chocolate factory
Timothe Chalamets Wonka has brown hair similar to Johnny Depps Wonka
Timothe Chalamets Wonkas hair is also curly he also has an optimistic charming smile and energy similar to Gene Wilders Wonka"
how many rember the movie the greatest showman hugh grant played in to im for sure ty 
Just saw it with my daughter and we loved it Very heartfelta great family film
You cant beat the original with Jean Wilder period its the best forever These remakes of movies are getting old and ruin the legacy in my opinion
too woke
012
In my theater
andhere we are still being exposed to these stories written by writers who were not exactly being sensitive to racial stereotypes and being celebrated for their use of tricks with words with their opaque meanings Dahl like Geisel Dr Seuss were very clever to use language to mask their racism and cast characters that were offensive and degradingreally whats an oompa loompa anyway  
Chocolate maker with a chocolate woman gotta love it
Shoutout to Daniel thrasher for slaying this role danielwonkaandthehoodiefactory
This movie is absolutely brilliant Captured the original film and Road Dahls essence
Mr bean
Film je realno teko sranje Pogledao sam ga jedino sto sam ocekivao nesto bolje od Bartonovog ostvarenja ali ovo je cisto gubljenje vremena
Lho appena visto e cantano in continuazione in pi non  come gli altri 2 che il protagonista  un bambino il protagonista  lui e non ha un passato DA SCHIFO
I just watched it Its a bit of a mess It COULD have been good but it needs alot of work to turn it into a good movie Hugh Grant was the best thing in it
I saw Mr Bean
You know what I liked it It was weird and magical
Original movie is way better 
Sensitivity readers have combed over the works of Dahl and smoothed over the edges of a notoriously sharp spiky author removing words and adding entire passages Augustus Gloop is no longer fat hes enormous still seems kind of mean but ok while Mrs Twit from The Twits is no longer ugly just beastly
"Sensitivity readers have combed over the works of Dahl and smoothed over the edges of a notoriously sharp spiky author removing words and adding entire passages Augustus Gloop is no longer fat hes enormous still seems kind of mean but ok while Mrs Twit from The Twits is no longer ugly just beastly

So well assume the sensitivity readers are fat ugly purplehaired cretins who never produced anything in their life that anyone will remember when they are gone"
Wow
I would have moved to see Johnny play in it again unfortunately hes probably still suffering from Ambers narcissistic life altering insanity she bestowed upon him

"Paul Kings movies restore my hope in humankind
The entire movie is coated in charm and imagination from every single shot performance set and song

Another heartwarming film that following the essence of Paddington makes you feel like watching a storybook come alive"
Gene wilder set the bar where it cant be reached 
Long time ago since watched a real magical american film 
that looks great
Theres a naked part in the movie I just forget when
Mr Bean
"Needed this on Christmas weekend  Awww unexpectedly lol interesting indeed
My 20 yr old kids and I went tonight remember to DREAM  Cant wait for the story of Willy to come
Namaste  Merry Christmas "
Whyyyyyy Stop touching classic films
"I walked out  The only 2nd movie in my life

The music wasnt memorable the lines were forced characters were two dimensional and the pacing was that of a bad Broadway show wanting to pack too much into the allotted time

It kinda felt like the movie version of The Producers  Great talent but horrible direction and pacing"
dark white nutty absolutely insane 
Wonka at first felt unnecessary to be made when I first saw the trailers but Im someone who grew up with both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilders portrayal of the character Im so happy to say this movie was fantastic Aside from some of the chocolate and the Oompa Loompa being CGI heavy Timothe Chalamet was a good Willy Wonka the songs were very catchy and I did feel that the magic and charm of the other films were in this
If youre thinking about seeing this this but not sure I RECOMMEND 100 IVE NEVER BEEN MORE INTERESTED IN A FILM IN MY LIFE If u like the funny sad musical kinda film its for you honestly I loved it so much
A really good movie and I dont even like musicals
Very wholesome movie
Looks pretty cringe lol
why are there so many black people
no thanks  nothing beats the original Wonka with Gene Wilder   This one looks sucky
If you have never watched the classic then it is an alright movie but if you have watched the classic Johnny Depp version then you will be disappointed The classic is just so full of chocolate Wonkas weirdness magic wonder and the storyline is extremely strong I really respect and appreciate the classic more now after watching this version
Esse verso ficou muito frozo manga rosa
It was an alright film
A life lesson with a  childhood memory very funny as well Excellent work to everybody
Good movie  recalling my childhood 
But he doesnt seem sadistic at all
HELP the songs and the dances are haunting me even in my dreams lol seriously Im one watch away from getting diabetes the movie just gets better and better every rewatch
Saw the movie today and it was incredible My favourite variation of the Willy Wonka movies An absolute gem
Boring
Loved this movie I watch anything that features Rowan Atkinson I also Woke up with the Oompa Lloompa song stuck in my head 
This is some Mr Beast knock off Wonka
This version of Willy Wonka feels like a MrBeast knock off
This movie cured my inner child
wanka
Yesterday i watch this in sm Clark movie it was amazing
Loved this movie
Looks cringe
we need to all of the recipes from the candy maker thing
Younger Johnny Depp could be probably better
This film was SO much better than I thought it would be Firstly its an obvious prequel to the Gene Wilder version aka the good version with some of the songs from the original and just some beautiful nostalgia sprinkled in But it doesnt depend on nostalgia It has a wonderfully unpredictable plot with humor emotional moments and surprising darkness and real threats and villains involving slavery poverty grief death etc all portrayed in a truthful but hopeful lens for children to see I thought it would be just whimsical and superficial but its not It has everything that Wish should have had Its the kind of childrens film with real threats and challenges that adults can feel engaged watching too This kind of musical seldom gets made anymore Its honestly very underrated considering its the best childrens film Ive seen in a long time
Film ok gzel kesinlikle izleyinbyleyici
Woke rubbish Wonka is meant to be an unsettling capitalist sociopath Im guessing this is a heartwarming feel good movie delight filled with modern movie making tricks that make you believe it was a movie of substance when in actuality it wasnt Nostalgia sells Bums in seats A safe movie for a safe executive profit Go see it people maybe Ryan Goseling will be in the next one
Definitely the best modern version to date Great actingplot and excellent characters Found myself having to stop myself fromclapping after some scenes and reminding myself I wasnt at the theatre Half the audience clapped at the end of the final scene Great for all ages young and old Definitely a classic 
Of course weve got a pinch of inclusivity A white boy had to be swapt for a black girl What a sad little world we live in
I have a Feeling this is going to be corny af
Watched this on the 16th id say it took the honor of best 2023 movie in my eyes 
There are so many black extras in Wonka they should have called it Wonkanda
Worst movie I have ever seen
when I first watched this I thought Willy wonka was Hayden  Christensen
Im now waiting for the sequel to the original  Want to see what Charlie did with the place once he took it over
103 Is that Mr Bean I see
I saw it today with my best friend  it was legendary
This film was so great I LOVE IT
"ompa lompa

I want jhonny deep
I hate musicals Butthis movie is great
Wow I love Timmys voice He has his charisma and fall in love with him
Im divided
Since childhood always tough about wonka have dark side and his chocolate factory kinda iceberg deep down we know we can make it dark version out of it
Johnny Depp is the best Wonka 
I hate musicals and was forced to go and watch it Im sad to say I actually loved it
Free Palestine 
Such a great movie Thanks WB
I love it
I just saw it today and sadly the theatre isnt full at all This is a magical movie and I really love it I wish they will make a sequel before wonka pass down the factory How noodles life have change after meeting her mom
I watched n i like it
Sorry for my self its really disappointing and boring movie
I love that Timothee Chalamet is playing wonka
im excited since theres rowan atkinson in it
102 mr bean tht lc sang y 
"I was very skeptical of this movie when I heard about it and even now while watching this trailer but the comments are starting to push me towards going to watch the movie

I really hope it can live up to the original  and the remake after the original that I grew up with"
The original Wonka was best this is sillysorrynot sorry
Who remembers all the hate this movie got because people thought it was another Hollywood remake But man this was absolutely NOTHING like the other Wonka movies Chalamet absolutely killed this role 
My two granddaughters saw this and hated it They wanted to leave before it was even over
My problem with this movie is how this fits in with the other two Like I am a big fan of both Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and its just hard for me to think of this movie as a prequel Its just completely different from anything said about Wonkas past in the two previous movies
looks so bad
Hmmmmm are all these comments from Bots that the Movie creators bought Not a single person talking about how terrible the movie was Every comment is talking about how they went and saw it yesterday and we must go see ithmmmmmhmmmmaybe Im a little skeptical but I think this isnt a real comment section or atleast half of the comments are bought bots
92K dislikes 
This movie is cuteand makes you tear up at the end
I just ate a dunkindonnuts chocolatemuffin it so good it has like sprinkle suger shape like salt and chocolate made like breed a soft bit bit crunchy first it so good 
221 is funny
This looks amazing I think Ill go see it with my friend
Is there no golden ticket and Willy Wonka
141 mr bean 
Very Good movie
I went to see the movie yesterday  I absolutely loved it I couldnt think of something else today Must watch 
I watched the movie Yesterday and Its great
This movie is much more tolerant than the old one Wowwhat a happiness
One of the worst movies i have ever seen more of a musical than a movie they targeted a 5 year old audience here just horrible
The commercial is very Misleading
your movie SUCKS its full of holes and you cant even get your own WOKE correct 
I absolutely adored this movie  Very heartwarming as well
I dont see the charm or quirkiness Visually looks dull with lots of browns and muted golds No psychedelia or absurdity Not sure what the point is for another remake of this story either Thematically it feels more wizardly than eccentric confectioner
johnny depp is still my favorite tho and more funnyy i heaed that its a musical movie more than the others but i still will watch it tomorrow at the cinema
Should watch this I rate910
he looks like he should have gotten the golden ticket
Is this a prequel to The 1971 or 2005 film
Great film great story Loved this one
Good movie definitely as iconic as the past 2
"Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa halirous I love it 
There was a period where the movie was very boring After that it was good"
I have watched it 3 times in my country Indonesia  this is an amazing film  I enjoyed every scene with a smile laughter and at the end tears the story was very touching  The chemistry between Wonka and the other characters is also very cool  all the soundtrack songs are very addictive  I will watch it again if I have free time
I LOVED IT Magical inspiring funny emotional and so uplifting  this role was truly made for Timothee Chalamet  a must watch movie 
To me when watching this trailer it appears as if the movie doesnt really go anywhere Im really disappointed in the outcome of this as 1 I dont believe young Wonka would have been wearing the same cape as his older Willie counterpart and 2 there doesnt seem to be any footage which focuses on the factory and how he got the factory designed and built If this part is not there at all then Im not sold on any kind of Wonka Reenvisioned kind of sequel Hard pass until maybe it comes on streaming tv
I read Charlie and the chocolate factory when i was in 5th grade as a kid  and now i am 25 and gone back to childhood after watching this trailer
Went with hubby and daughters and we had a great time my daughter doesnt like musicals but this is not the cheesy type and she loved it And I never thought I would see Hugh Grant in this type of role and it was fantastic I will never see him the same way again The scene after the zoo visit was amazing
They waited to create this trash so Gene could roll over in his grave Atleast they waited to make this garbage
I dont think so but it it 018
This film is amazing I want to go and see it again Magical
Timothe Chalamet was the perfect person for this role
This might be my favorite movie of all time
I seriously needed this movie in my life It has been a long time since I felt this way
Is it out
Ma  bellissimo
Saw it yesterday great movie Im sure Gene Wilder wouldve love it
Its good 
I thought Rowan died a few years ago Is this an old movie or did i just cry over nothing back then
1110 really awesome i cried so many times great storyline 
They just kill  this movie
""
It looks kinda mid but well see how ppl review it
Wow from Malaysia 
We are going to this movie tomorrow with my whole school im super excited
Absolutely terrible in every way
Missing Johnny Depp
My favorite movie and Im now obsessed with acting
Looks adorable but he just didnt read as wonka for some reason Depp and Wilder did it so well and wonky that this character was just a bit too straight laced and sane I guess  Look cute though
119 is so beautiful 
"Saw the film today and WOW it was absolutely wonderful  It truly captured the spirit of both the 1971 film and Roald Dahls book The film has the most fantastic set designs colors effects which looked magical on the big screen Holds so much nostalgia and will make you emotional A very quality touching storyline with an uplifting tone and brilliant acting Music is absolutely beautiful and fantastic 

Tip Youre definitely gonna need plenty of candy to snack on while watching it  "
Oh when House Atreides finds out about this they will not be happy
You had me until I saw the fuzzy wuzzy
Are they really afraid to make an all white movie these days
Awe its so good 
It was a great film
Oh how about the peach hahaha
Its sooo good 
Beautiful Magical The music was lovely  Timothe Chalamet was perfect Going again with more friends next week
What a beautiful film 
Not surprising that the director of Paddington bear ended up doing Wonka pretty well 8810
Has anyone found where we can watch the full thing online
The movie is so fun I love it
Im going to watch it today
Chocolate cartel Reminds of the episode on the boondocks 
Mr Bean saying run away got me laughing so hard
Im a 64 year old hardcore sailor and biker and this movie looks  AWESOME  I want to see it on the big screen at the theater
Best wonka movie ever
Im excited for this IMO they made Depp too much of a nut in Charlie  The Chocolate Factory
IDK why but I was dying of joy 
As someone who just watched the movie and loved it I must say this trailer is very well edited
I just hate it that theres no hint of it being a musical
a Carol of white people whit black
Someone needs to be really believing in a magic to play this innocent rolebut loved effects
Wonka is not a chocolatier he is mixing drugs
Omg they finally making good movies again Yes
Im going with my school to watch so excited 
Obviously grew up on the original charile and the chocolate factory came out when i was a teen this one is the best of the 3 as is Timothy as wonka The other ones didnt make me cry like this one and Paddington 2 did absolutely must watch no matter how old
I will always love Willy Wonka the original but this movie was so magical and beautiful Everything about this movie brought flashbacks to when I was a little girl watching the original movie with my dad Thank you for this movie 1010 recommend
No beautiful female actress boriiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiing
Is this movie a musical
THE MOVIE WAS SOOO GOOD
bleh
"Hes like the male version of mary poppins
But chocolatey"
Nahhh the johnny depp wonka is better
im gonna be wonkin my willy so hard to this
Loved the movie royalmovieboxx
I watched it Its super good
omg a normal movie people can watch without being indoctrinated by woke leftist agendas
About Tai Lung from the movie Kung Fu Panda Tai Lung is also a Dragon Warrior
I feel sorry for todays kids
Doesnt push woke makes money Movies that push woke go broke Anybody see a connection
Cant believe mr bean is in this what a God and a legend 
Poor  Hweahh
Excellent Timothee is extremely talented
Looks terrible
yo rs went wit my cousions for the popcorn shi was aigh like it felt like smth was gon happen first 30mins nth happend i fell asleep
Damn this movie hit hard in my heart
I just cant stand Timothee Chalamet Too bad Mightve been fun otherwise 
never overdo it with spice
looks terrible youd have to pay to watch this nowadays no good movies are being released
Yeet
Musical Damn
The original was much better 
Before he started killing and deforming kids 
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
No Just no Who makes these trailers
I watched it and I still want to repeatedly watch it again and again I dont basically like musical movie hard to understand for me but Willy Wonka made it crystal clear  the lyric is awesome
In memory of Gene Wilder 
This is the most watchable piece in 2023 Well done
This looks terrible Lets stop remaking already well done movies and come up with something new yall
Too much black people
best movie of 2023 didnt know wt to expect  from a huge success of the orginal chocolate factory but the world this movie built is so so good and magical  amazing songs full of houmour and just fun to watch
Good movie but not great Movie seemed to be a bit of a rush job singing not so great was borderline annoying at times The lead actor was good in parts of the movie and weak in others Thankfully it did not try to be much of a prequal to the original movie
TRASH
I really hate this BS hiding MUSICALS as just another movie THIS IS NOT if you are into musicals then go ahead
"The movie was a musical Plain and simple

They delivered the warm feelings at the end with the parents to kids but it was too late"
This movie really stunk Once again the writers were lazy and left the story underdeveloped It was a horrible mess and Hollywood should be ashamed
The amount of times I smiled and laughed during the film I also had several  moments where the caught timothee on just the right angle and he looked so much like Gene Wilder I think its his jawline Great film 
Bad lead actor Why is he speaking American
It was amazing
Timothe Chalamet Is one of my favorite actors
I find it interesting that Wonkas character sort of reminds you of a mix between Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp
This movie is phenomenal
That diversity hire ESG score approved
""
i watched the film its very good i recommend it its like a musical i enjoyed it really much
Highly recommend
""
Todo un ejemplo de meritocracia Ser una gran pelcula
THIS MOVIE IS ONLY FOR CHILDEN  THIS MOVIE WAS LITERALLY A MUSICALTHE SANG EVERY 5 MINUTES  BE SURE TO BRING A SLEEPING BAG BECAUSE YOU WILL FALL ASLEEP
Thank you Ive been waiting for this movie and it did not disappoint  even the villains are also funny haha Timothee as Willy Wonka was amazing I love this movie  1110 
I cried for this movie
The perfect family movie for any holiday
I just watched the movie in theaters today I LOVED IT
We love the movie sooo much
Theyre really changing the story
DIS MOVIE WAS DA BEST IN DA ENTIRE FRICKIN WORLD
This looks horrible
Just took the kids to see the movie It was awesome As good and fun as the firstIt took me back And the kids loved it too
WWWWWWWWWonka
I hope every person on this planet will take their inner child to see this movie Restore our belief in the power of our imagination I laughed I cried Im telling everyone I know to go see it
I had absolutely no idea This was a musical and I hated every bit of it
This is the worst movie i have watched in my life Why people like this Every second in the cinema was painful and boring Extremely dissapointed The plot is nonsense
Why always the same actors theres other actors with so much with potential
I was so skeptical at first because I loooove the old movie from the 1970s But OMG today I watched it and I was blown away This is such a great tribute to Gene Wilder I have no words absolutely magical 100 going to watch it again
I went to see this yesterday and its absolutely magical I love how instead of casting an older actress for Noodle and making her a love interest her and Wonka have a more big brotherlittle sister relationship it works so much better imo
Just saw it  despite the diversity its actually still quite good
Its not Johnny Depp
Warning supermariologan 2012
Nothing beats Depp as Wonka
I really love the trailer In fairness Timothe Chalamet had a lot of movie characters he portrayed in his career but this one as the iconic Willy Wonka is his most challenging role to date Best of all the entire cast in the movie are amazing Anyway Im excited to watch it 
""
Ya looks garbage
Another woke movie I will boycott
Just saw this movie on Friday Best movie that came out this year I absolutely loved it
Cant waittt tobwatch
I might actually watch it
Some people in these comments dont know the meaning of the word prequel and it is telling
"BEWARE ITS A MUSICAL
I have just wasted 2 hours of my life watching this rubbish"
Winli wonka i got flavour
Why not advertising it as a musical As the whole movie were songs
Knowing the true history of the Oompa Loompas 
Nah this finna be fire asf
He looks like a 19 years old boy  Gene was almost 40 when he played that character
Did AI write this My god its Johnny Deep in wonka Wait
I only watched charlie and the chocolate factory and in that movie wonka was a some kind of a psycho this wonka has a magical charm to it i absolutely how magical this trailer is and np wonder since its made by the director of Paddington and the producer of Harry Potter i am so excited to see the movie
Cant wait to see this  a classic i feel
Love the movie 
Oompa Loompas arent supposed to look like that
It doesnt look good and is all WOKE
Oh boy The woke version on Wonka No thank you
"A fantasy about a candy maker filmed in depressing brownish gray hues
No thanks"
I had literally no plans of ever watching Wonka but my mother wanted to go see a movie and I chanced upon Wonkas poster in my email the same morning I booked the tickets with not toohigh of hopes but I was surprised The movie was wonderfully warm My mother enjoyed it too although I had to translate some parts for her throughout the screening I am so happy today
"Nice movie 
But Johnny depp missing 
Only Johny depp can play wonka "
Johny Depp powinien w nim zagra obowizkowo bez Johna to nie to 
Mr bean 
New fave holiday movie saw it in the theater since I dont have a giant tv setup at home
Wow this is a great movie made me cry and laugh 
Obviously only watching it because Timothee chamlet is in it 
OOMPA LOOMPA
"Uhhhhh Nope  the original is best The Depp version acceptable and was good
And what i want to say about this one they havent been allowing others to post"
The next sequel is the chocolate factory which already aired ages ago with low quality work In hopes that remake will come again
Hard pass I liked the horror of the chocolate boat ride in the Original and little kids getting knocked off for being brats
Finally with no more woke BS Saw this movie in theaters and it was amazing
From the first minute to the last this film is a masterpiece The cast the setting and the costumes are amazing I knew Timmy as Wonka would be a good idea but the movie ended up being perfect Every detail deserves special attention because they are wonderful I recommend watching this film on the giant cinema screens the experience is wonderful And dont forget to eat chocolates
The movie was good and his songs were even better Crazy all the hate before it came out I think it was brilliant personally
Me and my niece enjoyed the movie 
what a bad choice for lead actor isnt he like 12
Someone see Mr bean
The police chief getting fatter was funny
Another woke adaptation
My fianc and I watched Wonka earlier today and it was really good It was a well written and entertaining origin story about 1 of the greatest characters ever Willy Wonka The film actually pulled back the curtain and showed us why he fell in love with making chocolate I recommend watching this film whether youre a fan of Willy Wonka or not especially if you have kids This is a great film for the whole family to enjoy In my opinion it wont ever top the 1971 Gene Wilder version But its a close second and the 2005 version with Johnny Depp was a little too weird for me Plus I dont feel as if Charlie and the Chocolate Factory paid homage to the original Wonka does that without taking away from its own identity Do yourselves a favor and go see this film
Saw it yesterday Really disappointed Wish I didnt waste the  honestly
In the first movie it showed Wonka getting braces as a kid When does that come into Wonkas life here tho hmmm
this was insanely good Such a fun movie
so sick of reboot after reboot after reboot
A shame they got an actor who looks 13 years old to play the main character That doesnt align with the novel nor the original movie Shame
This is the most epic Daniel Thrasher skit ever
Just watched it It was better than I thought it would be With how movie quality and writing is regressing I liked it Took my little ones Good times If you have a bad attitude you probably wont like it
I bet you I will stay far away from every theater ever while this is playing
This has zero feel of the classic and just a sad attempt to make something thats already epic epic again Except youre inauthentic and reaching for new age political  modernity instead of just writing a good movie
I see Hollywood is still out of ideas 
So private companies hoarded the chocolate and hated the poor and used the religious institutions to hide the chocolate and wouldnt let poor willy wonka make any chocolate by holding him down with regulations The corporation then used the hoarded and hid chocolate by the church to bribe law enforcement to do away with the competition Every child should see this movie and remember it for when they are an adult
I can hear the Mr Bean in Rowan Atkinson
I know its PG movie but sometimes PG movies you cant watch with young kids Anyone that watched it can you advice if ok to watch with my 7 yrs old Thanks in advance
Regular Movie
I saw the movie with my mom while dad stayed home I can only say this in short words It was Magical Musical and a truly was a world of Pure Imagination
The best thing of this movie is Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean 
YOUVE GOTTA BE KIDDING ME ANOTHER REMAKE WTF IS WRONG WITH YOU LAZY MOVIE PRODUCERS
hmm i will still watch it I will try to look past the acting of Willy Wonka
Looks woke and lame No thanks
Looks to be loads better than the Johnny Depp version
Very predictable and dragged on a LOT Boring really
Nobody wants this movie
Does Zelensky make a cameo
"  so lil Timmy Tim has nailed it once again ladies and gentlemen What an amazing actor you are This time you have proven that you are a great singer too The songs were such a treat to the soul Tears of joy 
Wonka Movie Its a magical adventure and you will indulge in this experience Totally justified all Willy Wonkas from the past No action no romance just pure bliss depicting innocent lives and their stories Big fan of your work man You never fail to amaze 
Children will love this For the first time ever my 8 year old said Great movie mom I loved it"
What a heartwarming movie 3
cringe trash
Disappointing  A good 23 of the movie taken was up by the trapped in the laundry plot   And what is the point or need to have all the oompa loompas being clones in the last 2 movies  Too much of a musical   It had it moments though  I think the Johnny Depp movie was better overall
Dom was really good impressed and Im a hard character to impress
Its not Wonka enough for me
The actor dont compare with the last Waka film pfff
Looks absolutely atrocious At least its not a remake
Didnt this movie come out like three years ago
the diversity killed it there i said it
every movie now has a token black
As long a its nothing like that Johnny Depp travesty
Gene wilder simply cant be matched Disney should have left it alone
I loved it Whimsical and funny I cried halfway through Im definitely going to take my friends sometime soon Go watch it
Seems horrible
Looks stupid So overdone This never beats the original classic
NOPE Nothing close to the actual movie This Producer needs to watch the original movie again
The wokesters made sure to have bIack people in every single scene of the trailer lol
Here we go momma
Best movies of Timothys for sure I smiled  laughed and cried at the same time everyone should go and see it  Oh my gosh he can sing
2023 UK is 3 bIack but apparently 100 or so years ago it was 60 bIack Interesting
Oh wow the acting really sucks in this trailer
IM READY TO WONK MY WILLY
Not gonna lie but the songs in this movie is lit and  addictive
Such a beautiful movie  watched it todayy 
Should have kept Johnny
Just looks boring and another 2020 movie that nobody asked for or wanted
No one can replace johnny depp
I love this movie Finally something worth watching for
Ive been waiting for so long for Wonka to be live on cinema but i hate it because Timothie talked in a disrespectful way about Palestine and underestimated the current situation in Gaza
This looks TERRIBLE
Wow lets black wash a classic for woke fools Another Hollywood failure
finally i found paul atradeis here
This was so needed
Loved the movie It was so heartfelt whimsical uplifting and funny
If you have not already watched this show  Its amazing how they made it
Not making me wanna see it
This is not based on the original Wonkas yet they used the original song We all know Wonka had a father who was a dentist but okay 
looks bad good luck
WHAT ARE WE GONNA ZOO WILLY
"This movie was absolutely amazing and breathtaking

It felt like I was watching a classic Disney animated film and the music was beautiful

It was just perfect in my eyes an absolute masterpiece"
Whos here after seeing the movie opening night in 4DX 
Cant leave well enough aloe I bet it is as stupid as the Johney Depp version
GO SEE WONKA  IT IS A AMAZING MOVIE
Jonny Depp is wonka 
Needs more CGI  
im not that type that are watching movies but all I could say after seeing this movie is that i ended up in tears genuinely an incredible movie i really really recommend watching it 
Here we go momma  
Im kinda concerned because it looks and sound like a Disney live action Is it good
I going to see it tomz
Worst movie ever dont wste your time
wtf is this trash
Tbh Timothee cant beat jhonny depp
what a fantastic movie best one of this year
Nobody beets Gene Wilder version
I watched it in cinema very nice 
One of the worst films I have ever seen
Did I hear him right the chocolate cartel aint no way 030 and 031
This movie is very nice our school take as to show  this movie
Wokea
"I didnt wait and I didnt expect anything great but what can I do if I really liked the movie And whats more this my second best picture of 2023 Simply pure magic movie
One of the greatest movies of all time
My favorite Wonka version
Huh Huh a double huh"
Its a musical
Boring
This movie looks trash they get worse
Why lol
"Its interesting that they are completely ignoring the 2005 version and this is more of a prequel to the one from 1971 although it has some differences 
It even has a remix of Pure Imagination and the actor who plays Wonka looks like a younger Gene Wilder"
125  THE MUSICC FROM HERE IS GREAT 
Spoiler Mr bean comes out good movie
Have our standers gotten so low we think this is good
What an amazing movie Just watched it in cinema and must say it went beyond my expectations 
CGI as always horrendous
0216 hahaha
I love grapes
di maganda yung movie 
Oh man  poor Timothy  You can never follow Gene Wilder
Looks amazing 
"Its the day today 
December 15 "
Good for kids But not in sync with the other Wonka movie that thus should happen in the future of this universe
Stop putting black Girls in all of the movies
Yeah Timothee knocks it out of the park with this As does Hugh Grant Hilarious and wholesome Need to suspend some disbelief but all in all a really fun movie 9810
Cant wait to watch the full movie
waaaaaaaaaaaaack
For the uneducated people calling this movie woke woke means to be aware of social injustice I see nothing wrong with this movie if it was truly woke then wonk would have been a Female
For he IS the Chocolate Haderach
Aww good old diversity Ruins everything
I just finished watching this movie and OMG This was indeed one of my favorite movies of all time This movie was an escape to all and everything that bad and horrible in this world I was laughing and smiling throughout this film I fell in love with all of the characters The word I can describe this movie is MAGICAL Timothee Chalamet needs to win some type of award for this masterpiece and the movie itself too I encourage everyone to see this movie I hope you enjoy the best time the same that I did 1010
WTF Who wants this garbage
Just watched it and it was awesome 
Never been so uninterested in a movie trailer 
They shouldve used an actor that looks like a young Gene Wilder
OKI just got back from watching the show and I actually thought it was pretty good person I went with thought it was fair and there was only a few people there so I dont know what that means maybe a lot of people just didnt want to go or they were still worked at the time all in all I think it was pretty worth it I wanted to see how it all started And I like that that was pretty good  Will there be a sequel My hopes fall You must stay until the end There is some hidden credits but nothing that actually says that theres gonna be a sequel or not I didnt stay for the whole thing past The end of credits just the scenes that they wanted you to see again like I said I like that  I give a thirteen out of thirteen skulls and I said check it out
Im not sure if Im watching Wonka or Harry Potter on chocolate
Lmao Mr beans actor  is there
THIS MOVIE IS BAD 210
Harry potter theme
Willy Woka is sure to be a hit
this looks bad lol
Hank likes this
Im not watching any new movies these stupid r3tards cant figure out how to MAKE NEW STUFF YOURE PATHETIC FAILURES
I am tired of seeing Timothee Chalamet in EVERYTHING  Like my brain is just tired of his face invading every narrative  It is nothing personal  he is a fine actor  But he is like corn  do we need corn in everything
"Just watch with 2 kids Very nice movie It has been a long time since i watched such a nice musical and positive storyline
All actors and actresses are fantastic all with very nice vocal "
So Hugh Grant stealing the scene very funny some nice effects and  meh Timothys lines appear a bit flat for a larger than life character Theres no edge like the Gene Wilder version I dont see any type of spark will check the next trailer for signs of life from the character
not good at all boring and plain nothing to the original  This prequel was disappointing
"There will never be Another remake better than the late   
Great and talented
Gene Wilder may he rest in Christ"
ALAN JOHNSON
Saw this last night  Its amazing 
watched it the other day and it was surprisingly good
But how does it explain why and how he gets his sadistic streak in Gene Wilders version This version seems too goody two shoes
The fact that they did the oompa loompas right makes this instantly better than the Johnny Depp one
finally a movie that feels long not just running in a fast pace
My Ultimate Crush Timothee Chalamet
Fantastic movie
Great movie just seen it today
I saw mr Bean waw
Thank you Warner Bros Team for making such type of feel good movies me and my sister really very obsessed with these The Shazam was also very great
Im surprised with how many great reviews its getting
Im watching this movie tonight
Am glad they found the perfect actor to play WW Yay Cant wait
saw it and it was great
Nope
El soldado chamam acta de Willy Wonka
This looks terrible
Saw it on cinema last night It was the best film Ive watched this 2023
One of THE BEST MOVIES 2023
niente questi sono capaci di fare un film su papa woetyla e farlo africano e sappiamo bene perch che cringiata schifosa GetWokeGoBroke
I think Chalamet wasnt the best choice
What is Mr Chalamets acting exactly
The end got me I was in tears
Tired of all the original movies being redone  My family is never going to watch this movie  Leave the originals alone please  
Im actually excited to see this well see if it lives up to gene wilder
piees
this movie sucks
Love that it feels like the original unlike the Depp version
Holy botted comments
Way to ruin an original
Im sorry but isnt willy wonka set in 1800s and its looks like 1800 britain and wasnt it mostly white rich people the 1971 movie all white people and same as 2005 so why is it now 
Did they seriously replace Charlie with a black female No hope left for movies
This version honestly does not seem interesting or entertaining Just by seeing the trailer I can already tell Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 2005 is much better Movies now a days are way too flashy which ruins the subject and story Tone it down
Looks shite
You just kill it every time The best Always
I love Timothee Chalamet but I always thought Rob Schneider would have played a perfect Wonka too
The actor who plays Wonka has no charisma or charm Wooden
flop
cringe they just hired timmy chamelet becuase hes popular to teen girls
Just watched the movie  heads off to the one of the best musicals after the first enchanted
I didnt read anything bout it so I was expecting a remake Pleasantly surprised to discover an origin story that was so well told One of the most magical  special experiences in cinema history up there with the best of musical comedy genre Gotta hand it to WB for allowing it to be made and for avoiding wokeism They just focused on magic hope creativity imagination friendship motherchild bond toughness and cruelty of the world out there overcoming adversity universal themes that people of any race can relate to
I saw the movie yesterday I hate musicals but that was the most wonderful musical movie Ive ever seen the acting of thimoth remembered me about hatter of Alice it was a good experience
Ahhhh yes nothing like not hiring a dwarf to play a oompa loompa but you can just CGI Hugh Grant  on a tiny body and thats totally fine wouldnt wanna offend anybody
watched it with my girlfriend and since its my first time watching in cinema its the best things Ive seen
In some days Im going to the cinema to wach it 
I honestly never thought I would ever see a remake close to my favourite childhood film with Gene Wilder but this is absolute delight the ending actually brought a tear to my eye and transformed me back to that kid Ive nearly forgot bravo
Great movie where my family enjoyed it The dancing scene on the roof after getting the milk the flamingo flying  the balloon etc shown a serious production that was worthy for cinema tickets Well done

"This looks so bad that people are remembering the Depp remake fondly and that remake was bad too 

Oh Hollywood"
"Ive always wanted to see Willy Wonka help a poor POC and I just wanted them to admit that willy wonkas chocolate factory was mostly built by a chocolate girl

NOOOOOOOOT NEXT"
Wonka look like Billie Joe Armstrong greenday
"Garbage
Next one"
Kapan kapan di tayangin di youtube yang fullnya biar banyak yang nonton
Hollywood is destroying movies by only adding one colour main characters these days Its ridiculous that the woke left have destroyed so many movies in the past few years
I CANT WAIT TO SEE IT
bloop
Terrible choice in casting this guy as willyKids is to wholesomeGene and Johnny perfect for the roleThis is woke willy and Ill pass
""
This has none of the charm camp or whimsy of the original Just another fantastic display of CGI and mediocre actors
Hollywood disappointing as always
The chocolate  Cartels 
Nothing will ever compare to the 1971 version nothing
There will only be one and Gene Wilder was the lead
i just watched the movie i love it it made me laugh and it made me cry
"Casting a Jew in the lead role this is not wonky but a movie about the UN diversity 

thats going to fill seats"
"Is it a musical Or just have multiple looking music numbers
Either way this is NOT WILLY WONKA"
I think I love the original to much to want to watch this  Even as an old adult he was still working on the fizzy lifting drink This young Wonka has way more confidence then the old Wonka
looks fantastically unappealing
I would love for them to eventually do a sequel with Charlie running it to see how it turned out
looks like a load of woke rubbish
Timothee supports Israel so we wont be watching
Is Willy wonka a graduate of hogwarts I need to known that Warner bros
Is Willy wonka a graduate of hogwarts
Wtf
Just watched absolutely brilliant a must see
How on earth did i never see this trailer for the passed 5 months  And its this month  Im sold
Then 30 years later he gives his factory to a child and his suspicious grandfather he knew for less then a day
107
Ha Wonderful casting The kid from Call Me by my Name Truly a beautiful man like the actor in Death in Venice
Finally an actual marvellous remake of a famous classic unlike some that just copy the entirety of the original in a horrible way
Forced and weakly derivative
Wonka looks like a normal person Not a creep
Johnny Depp was brilliant
Chalemet is too flat
I love the part where Wonka said Its wonking time and proceeded to Wonk all over the place
I have an idea   How about making a movie that hasnt been made before  Oh no that will take some ingenuity
Yawn Not
That part for his mom 
Nee dit is niet goed Het moet een mysterie blijven
This looks FIRE
Una  abrerracion pero la vere
im going to watch it on thursday with my school
Cant believe they recast an anxious fiery skinny little white boy with a fat cheeky little black girl
So many blacks ugh
The film was released here in Brazil and I admit it was the most beautiful film Ive ever seen  I never liked musicals but this one exceeded all my expectations I simply left the cinema crying influenced by its magic
Garbage
I honestly think this is going to be a bust It doesnt have the same feel cinematography or pizzaz the original movie or even the sequel had I dont think woke is the word but it looks far too song and dance or show boaty in a bad way Almost like its forced The original Wonka movie stayed in the realm of reality what could actually possibly be with few exceptions here and there relating to his inventions this is just outlandish
i watched this today and it was so so good considering seeing it again soon 
After his comments he made no thank you
He supports genocide no thank you
Ooh look diversity hires
Diversity Inclusion  Equity
Gran pelcula
Timothe Chalamet is perfect to play Wonka
Slugworth is not black
Exelente produccin muy interesante
Se mira una pelcula muy interesante con bastante historia y trama ya quiero ir a verla
Another cash grab by WB We dont need another Willy Wonka remake The Gene Wilder version was and always will be the definitive Willy Wonka
Mui buena

OK THIS LOOKS STUPID
Really sick of continual sequels  Stick with the originals  far far better
The story was ok The  constant singing every 5 minutes made this incredibly annoying
needs acting classes
Nele
Im glad they didnt spoil the Snow Piercer train in the trailer
This movie is amazing trust me Just watched it yesterday at the cinema
"Not my cup of tea I like the quirkyness of Johnny Depps Wonka

This one just seems like another musical movie And its not the greatest showman"
I was so ready to hate this movie Ive seen both movies as a kid more times than I could count read the book so many times But dang it I came out of this movie with a huge smile on my face the music was so much fun the choreography felt like a giant broadway show There are so many great surprises in this movie if you go in completely blind Id say this comes closer to Roal Dahls original text in spirit than the previous movies They had this weird sense of darkness that I attribute to the filmmakers the book had zany moments but never felt psycho This felt like  warm Christmas hug like an old VHS tape you discovered on the attic on a rainy afternoon
I hate oompa loopa design
Carryminati
It looks delightful Cant wait to see it
I love it 
Im from India this is the first English movie I watched in big screen  theatre this movie is so good I really like this movie
Fab feel good film not to be missed Loved it

When Frylok said We need to save the Umpas speechless
was looking forward to watching this at Christmas until I found out it was a musical
 
Again i mean why
He needs some puertorican food
This movie was amazingtoday I went to watch it
Johnny Depp was the best but I dont think this is bad
Its 999 useless singing and 01 story
Where is his dentist father
me
Looks utterly soulless and unimaginative Hollywood continues to mine nostalgia because they have no original ideas
So this is the story of Willy Wonka rather than how he gave the factory to Charlie YAY 
wtf happened to hollywood did they all quit cocaine at the same time
This is going to turn into a trilogy
Is Timothee Chalomet trying to set a record for number of times starring in the 3rd remake of a movie
Why not make Wonka black too 
My favourite Movie was Charlie and the chocolate factory  how jonny dep make the factory it was mystery for me now it willbe clear 
"Forgive me for this but
Why does the guy in the yellow suit looks like a British blonde version of Hitler"
Without Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp Will the Real Mystical Fantasy take One Into Illuminations of Imaginations and Beyond
The Gene Wilder original is a huge part of my childhood and I will always love it That said Im looking forward to this one Plan to go see it Christmas Day It looks delightful
This makes me so happy I never thought this role could be so perfect for timothee chalamet He is a really good actor Ive always love ww and the cf   And to think hugh grant and rowan a Makes this so much better i am watching it this week and i cant wait for it
The auto tune in the songs is serving on a whole new level
I watched this a few nights ago I wasnt impressed
"It looks like trash and has no charm
Tim Burtons version wasnt as good but its still a serviceable film
The original 1971 version still reigns supreme"
Ok so only just watched this film today and I have too say I was surprised with how good the movie is everyone is on point in this film
Could never be better than Johnny Depps Willy Wonka
This looks awful
Guarantee its going to be woke garbage Ill bet on it
Hmmm sorry Depp did it better
I watched this movie today its pretty good I cant wait for the squeal of it has one also the oompa loopas are the best
"The 3rd remake of a film You dont see that quite often 


It seems like they have totally changed the story of Willy wonka and its more about how he got started etc for the young ones it will be cool and magical For the older ones I feel like it ruins it and I will never beat the classics But imo it does look good"
Missing Johnnymissing umpha lumphamissing the whole factory
Watched this movie today it was magnificent
Where the f is Johnny depp
Napanood ko kanina sa cinema anganda nya sobra Nakakatawa sya tas maganda rin ung mga kanta great din ung acting  need ko irewatch 8510 kase di ko masyado kita ung screen malabo mata ko eh pero oks lng 910 final rate ko 5 minutes late kami kaya di namin napanood ung intro
Too many blacks as usual
Im used to seeing an older Willy wonka
Shank 
I really liked it 
Why What do they want to tell differently The old movie still make sense and looks good
The film was amazing
Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka for me 
Willie Wonkas kid got a dark suntan and  needs a haircut
I saw the movie and it was sick
"Done watching it Its so so so good  Best of all the movie I saw worth the price 
Super love all the song it makes me cry "
Im kind of glad this was a British telling American movies today have a way of creating a heavily editing flashy superficial spectacle which ultimately falls flat and is soulless the British are better storytellers with more nuances and romanticism in a movie like this
Willy Woka
"I just saw it it was great I didnt expect anything I just sat there and watched I left the cinema full of positivity and joy Dont compare and give this movie a chance 

PS Timmys a theater actor before he became a hollywood star Spoiler He did an incredible job "
Winter feel good filmgo see  I ignored the negative reviews and took the kidswe all were totally absorbed 
Cash grab for all the Chalamet thirsting fans 
Awesome
Hmmm well the shots look nice it seems whimsical and Timothe is hot Hoping its decent enough so I can enjoy the pretty scenery and ogle the leading lad 
Is this related to the Depp one I think the continuity is distorted Unless this is the wonkaverse
Just stop Nobody asked for this The original is a classic It does not need to be remade again with another half assed CGI slop fest
this looks horrible
This looks really dumb
Homunculus
No one can replace Jhonny Depp 
I will go to cinema monte carlo next days
Deeply political virtue signaling atrocity As if they hadnt ruined it enough with the Johnny Depp version Its propaganda at its worst
This movie is magic can make us happy
Just got back from seeing this with boyfriends kid and he asked to leave half way through so much singing Story line dragged But hugh grant as an oompa loompa redeemed it slightly but not enough for us to bother to stay til the end
Ill take the original with Gene Wilder any day and my mind will never change on this It might be old but its timeless for me Johnny Depp wasnt Willy Wonka enough and neither is Chalamet  sorry I think they cast Grant well though but wont be enough for me to see this film  sorry
Creatively bankrupt rehashed and unoriginal garbage
I rather take my kids to PORORO Star Adventure
This looks like trash hopefully its a big ol flop
The ompa lompa looks awful  I dunno if Id watch it I think Id be too bored
This movie looks truly terrible
Anyways Johnny depp mastered the witty  sarcastic wonka s character better  He was perfect 
Woke joke  All the oompa loompas are now non binary climate activists
Saw this yesterday  This is the family musical we all need  Very highly recommended for bonding with the kids  Will give everyone a great shot of joy this Holiday Season Truly a magical moment of Pure Imagination
I liked the part where he said its wonkering time and then wonkered all over augustus gloop
I will watch today at cinema Very curious about it 
ROWAN ATKINSON
I sounds bit odd Cuz chocolate fuctory was actually realistic in some way There were so many unreal things but based on the premises weired thingsnot not entirely impossible things existing whole things were sarcastically depicting the reality But this thig looks like magic involved Its more like watching Alice movies
just another loser pedo remake
Saw the ad on TV got keen Saw the trailer I probably wont watch this Seems too harry potter magical non sense The originalthe best feels much MUCH more authentic Almost like everything there is possible Gene Wilder didnt act as Willy Wonka he was Willy Wonka This kid doesnt have the same natural energy
Timothe is so sweet
Most would consider this movie unnecessary and a cash grab My sister mother and I absolutely loved this movie even if nobody asked for it to be made Highly recommend
I got an Italian ad so I thought its Italian until I realised that its this man lol
Saw it last night with my grand children all in total agreement Probably one of the worst films ever made The trouble was theyd watched the real 1971 film last year 
"Call me a psychopath







But Im actually looking forward to this movie"
Too late Ive started dancing now lol
Why did I randomly have a dream including Timothe Chalamet last night I hadnt even seen the trailer or knew who he was in delth Did they pay for this advertisin
Willy Wonka had a sinister side which was important to the story  There doesnt appear to exist that side in this version
Why they have to cast that stupid Chalamet seriously that pissy girly boys acting is soooooooooooooooo bad
Oh yay another woke pos from the sewage pile that is the collective hive mind of woke writers
Theres nothing original anymore
Did u know the actor of mr bean is there He is the priest for the church
BOOOOOOOOOOOO
Fun fact This would be the first movie to use the new WB onscreen logo
"PK



WONKA  Official Trailer"
I am here coz of Mr Bean Anyone 
Again the black society live off the back of white privilege they cant even come up with their own idea they have to use an English white classic to be part off
the movie was very funny 1010
See Warner brothers not selling out like Disney If this was a Disney film willy wonka would have been black
woke filth as usual
Literally Timothees worst movie and a genuinely bad overall movie
Oomph loompa
I feel like they remake this every few years wasnt there a film of this made only a few years ago with Johnny Depp And one before that with Gene Wilder which was great and didnt need a remake
Creatively bankrupt much This Wonka has zero charisma and wtf with all the black people Please tell me that an extremely advanced AI just spits these movies out nowadays
There werent so many blacks in Europe back then I guess Hollywood is not into making realistic movies anymore
Id say its gonna be shite
As a 90s baby Im upset with this lol 
i really wish this wasnt a thing Great actor mediocre idea
Nothing better than depp version
Wow this looks generic and completely different story to the original
Suddenly in 2023 all these black characters magically appear Funny how the comments are turned off the UK Ireland version of the trailer Seeing English period pieces with a bunch of black characters looks so fake and ridiculous
Was bit of a let down   but stil ok I spouse 6 out 10
That movie was soo boring I dont like the character that plays Wonka I dont feel that same excitement and thrill has the previous Willy Wonka movies
Looks woke Im out
I cant believe my uncle worked in this Hollywood movie 
Gene Wilder must be rolling in his ditch
With the Must have PC Thrown up  could be the Jammy Sours
Just saw the movie timothee blew my exoectations
"It looks as generic as a commercialised Xmas 
Zzzzzz
Just watch the original"
"Now I been slowly getting into Willy Wonka again watching both the 1971 and 2005 movies and like I will say that I am excited but also nervous because this has so much potential and I do like what I see in the trailer just afraid Hollywood has not learned their lesson of changing classic tales but I like to stay optimistic I feel like Chalamets performance is fine from what we see in the trailer and I feel like many are way to quick to jump to conclusions before the movie is even released I obviously dont think he can like past the acting that Gene wilder did but I mean since they seem to at least from a design standpoint mimic the 1971 version I can keep my hopes up that we get this more charming tone that Wilder Wonka has compared to Depp Wonka Feel like we should wait until the movie comes cause we are all a little too quick to jump to conclusions and while sure he doesnt appear as weird or quirky as Gene wilders portrayal guess its important to keep in mind that this is before Wonka closed his factory and isolated himself which I definitely feel like has a part in why the man appears like he is in his own head at times in all depictions really

So I am excited a little nervous but optimistic but best of all they did not give him the ugly bowl cut thing they gave Depp and that is the best thing of all"
i miss johnny deephe was my forever willi wonkathe best acting ever ever and forever
Please not another Wonka movie Why can writers nowadays not write new stories No imagination any more
How do you like your people darkwhite and nutty
It looks like a forced version of this story Gene Wilder movie was brilliant Tim Burtons was not bad but without the magic of the first film this one looks like the weakest version Chalamet is not prepared yet to be Willy Wonka
Doesnt look so good to me
This looks good Im wondering if Gene Wilder would have liked it RIP GW
I dont think Im interested
""
Bro what is this shite
The best Willy Wonka is Johnny Depp hands down still fresh in my head like it came out yesterday
They looks way better than that garbage remake with Tim Burton I wish they had a tribute to gene wilder
Did the country really need another wonka movie Hollywood is totally incapable of doing anything original these days
Did the country really need another wonka movie Hollywood is totally incapable of doing anything original these days

Cant wait to see his origin story and learn what drove him to sugar murder children for funsies 
You know what they should do put tickets for the movie theater in the chocolate bars
ONE WORD describes it in french LINGUEE
I thought this was a remake Its an origin story I like that
It is so difficult to top Willy Wonka 1971  A film like this one a remake can make or break an actor  I hope they were well paid just in case
Bro sounds like Mark Rover
What is this
This looks terrible 
Everywhere in the uk its dec 8
YUHHH SO GOOD
Boycott
Nope wont be going to see this version as it doesnt even come close to previous Wonka movies
what anembarrassment
Jonny depp 
They need to stop remaking stuff and have there own  imagination
Making funny of H4m4S  Sure this trash movie will be our Boycott list 
This is just awful Focusing on wonka also shows you didnt actually read any of the books
All we need is a wonka video game
Looks bad
Lol more woke garbage Lmao even
Im seeing this tomorrow looks great
im interested in how this movie will end tbh or i guess the 2nd half of the film i wonder if well see the change in Wonka from his seemingly optimistic self in this trailer to who he was in the original
"152 The delivery of that line is awesome I think this is gonna be a good movie
EDIT some friends and I went and watched it Let me say it was absolutely perfect It combined emotion and comedy perfectly It was hilarious SPOILER At the end when he started to sing the original song from the original movie it really just perfected the movie 1010"
Please tell me he sings it
Please dont be woke please dont be woke 
Looks woke  black girl and dwarfs out of the job again
Omg
this looks awful its supposed to be about horrible children not horrible adults
No
a trash movie with a trash leading actor
Imagine if they got Lip from shameless to be wonka Movie looks great but not a big fan of the main actor
Chocolate makes you happy but watching this movie making you free from all the problems
I cant I WONT accept him as Wonka It will always be Gene Wilder and then Johnny Depp No one else
141 anyone else hearing Mr Bean there
He reminds me of scott dissick
The resounding drums triumphant brass and sweeping strings of epic music inject movie trailers with a profoundly thrilling ambience This style of bold operatic composition brings an unmatched sense of grandeur The full symphonic sound washes over you instant goosebumps as that exhilarating melody unfurls No words are needed to feel the mood  whether tensions simmering into war cries or heroes rising against the odds to turn the tide The music amplifies the high stakes hinted onscreen into palpable excitement These epic anthems punctuate trailers with exclamation points ensuring the adventure ahead leaves an indelible impression whether it features clashing armies or characterdriven drama The marriage of epic musics unrelenting crescendo and carefully edited visuals forms a siren song drawing us right into imagined new worlds brimming with action emotion and spectacle Who can resist such powerful musical storytelling the ultimate appetizer promising grand purpose behind these tales We have those ingenious sound composers to thank for trailers that spark such strong senses of destiny through their triumphant symphonic suites alone  our hearts quicken and imaginations ignite
 142 Run awayyyyy fades idk why but that part got me
he seems a little too clean for a whimsical and brilliant yet crazed and unempathetic entrepreneur
Looks very inclusive
One detail this film gets wrong in the book when Willy Wonka first started his business he had ordinary human workers working in his factory Then his rival chocolate makers started hiring spies to work in his factory and then give the secrets of his special chocolates to them It was only after that happened that Wonka traveled to the land of the OompaLoompas and had them take their place as his new workers This movie is supposed to be about young Wonka when hes just starting out as a professional chocolate maker so this should be before he meets the OompaLoompas
y los Oompa Loompa
W gf 23 w t m o dkaa dkasad
Rowan Atkinson is going to be funny as always in the film
Its much easier to make a good trailer than a good movie If the trailer is this bad the movie will be worse than a combination root canal and colonoscopy
Gene Wilder was brilliant and charismatic Johnny Depp was creepy and seemed to be a pedophile This new guy is a little fruit
terrible
Of course there has to be a black kid
Dawg just watch the original
Why was this necessary Sighhhh
So before he became bitter and lonely and gave up the factory Yall just make anything
Its a story set in England before the third world invaded Why are there all these token people in this movie
o wow  the evil capitlists are preventing Willy Wonka from becoming a capitalist  the horror
Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa is wild
ya ampun its fcking timothy chalamet
Its so good that I want to watch second time
Boicott boicot zionist
I sure hope there are no shoehorned blacks overstating their welcome on the screen
It is a feelgood nostalgic yet refreshing film I watched it in theaters an hour ago and I love it  this deserves a lot more audience ESPECIALLY CHILDREN 
seru ga bang
wow that is just terrible
"warning contains spoilers
Spectacular production wonderful casting and a fantastic soundtrack to boot I was simply blown away by so many amazing original songs and performances and theres a good balance of comedy and drama that would appeal to the whole family Having only seen a movie poster of Wonka 2023 I did not have much to go on I was also a tad skeptical if I would enjoy it as much as I had enjoyed Johnny Depps and Gene Wilders performances of Willy Wonka prior to this movie  But its the holidays I had a day out with my niece and this was premiering so we got the tickets And I was not to be disappointed

spoiler
From the playful glint in his eyes to his quirky smiles and canetwirling sequences Timothee Chalamets whimsical performance gives nods to both Depps and Wilders earlier depictions of Wonka while still adding his own spin and spice and all things nice to the young Wonka he plays

There is a purity and crispness in Chalamets delivery of both script and song that encapsulates that sense of wonder a young Willy Wonka manages to hold on to through the formative years of his youth despite all the setbacks and hardships that befalls him And this is key because it carries over into his later years and it is the reimagining through this lens of childlike innocence that inspires audiences around the world to have hope and dare to dream again

Special mention to Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa who delivers his lines in perfect matteroffact British fashion My niece liked his performance so much she was singing Oompa Loompa all the way home while I tried to sway her to sing Pure Imagination instead 
spoiler

If there is one movie to catch this Christmas with your loved ones this should be it And would I watch it again Oh ABSOLUTELY"
Lund ki movie Chutiyon ke liye bani bas

Trash movies because the cast is so disgusting

Sally Hawkins what a treasure
Johny depp
Johnny Depp nailed it

"Timothe Chalamet isnt quirky enough to play Wonka even in the trailer all his lines are falling flat I know Depp is subject to a lot of controversy and say what you will but he was amazing at playing Wonka He nailed it 
And Gene Wilder is the master of weird of course so no need to point out that he did a great job"
Who is this movie for Yeah like People in 2023 really want to see a Willy wonka movie Another very out of touch move
"WB W0nka
Budget 125 M
1 hour 56 minutes

J0hnny was fired by WB fantastic beast Grindelwald"
"Ppl who saw Mr Bean
"
How can you not love Timothy Charlemagne he is my favorite actor
Woke bs
Timothe Chalamet isnt quite deadpan or awkward enough to portray Wonkahmmm
So is it going to be a thing that a little person wasnt used for whats traditionally a little person role or is them making  Hugh grant a little person through cgi going to be the thing Idk but something about it is going to be a thing
"127 
Hes good
Toooooooooooo goooooooooooooooood"
Another movie to be ruined by the wokies
I dont see any Asian Cast
Meh  except Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa 
I got optimistic for the Star wars movies and look how they turned out We shall see about this one

have to say from the trailers this looks to be good fun
"000 What was he looking at 
"
An American WIlly Wonka   Now I know the world is coming to an end
This guy is a terrible actor Hollywood must be having their way with him
Always have to ruin a good thing
should of just called it woka
Tim is such such such such SUCH a bad actor
Im not sure about this film Im sorry theres only one Willy Wonka to me and thats Gene Wilder Everytime they bring out a film it just doesnt compare to the original
No Johnny Depp Who greenlit this
Do you spot any similarity with King Charles III A popularity booster for the Monarch
"Social Engineering Propaganda The Future Will Be Chocolate
I say MORE MILK"
Everything about this movie from the concept to the team behind it is amazing except Chalamet Hes just not Wonka He seems more like an edgy teen wanting to put a vampire diaries spin on it
Omg they just keep ruining the classics because this looks awful
Please Dubbed the telugu language
No No No Leave it alone Let it go Smh

"Gene Wilder will forever be the best

This smells of Wokenka"
Yall just gotta keep ruining our classics huh Please Just stop 
I guess the best way to keep a classic alive for generations is to make it relevant I hope Timothee Chalamet can live up to the role
Oh look they needed an excuse to put a black kid in Willy Wonka 
Thanks for posting
This looks horrible
This is not the role for young master Timothee 
Yeah man I dont know
I like Chalamets version of the character he made Wonka jovial and likeable not a creepy weirdo like Johnny Depp did
i still think nothing will beat the original willy wonka Jean wilder
"Like we need ANOTHER movie of this subject Gene wilder nailed it the first time Depp creeped it out 
Yeesh"
When does that movie come out
These Wonka movies just get worsejust a few months ago Chalamet was a dressed up in a red backless outfit and now he is trying to play Wonka
Not gonna lie beating Gene Wilders Wonka is always going to be a steep uphill battle and this is no different Something about this Wonka doesnt feel right
What A black female main character in the cast How stunning brave and original Nobody has ever thought to remake a movie doing that
Good to see Snowpiercer has prequel now
I think I know what feels off That actor is too young lookingsounding Like its completely unbelievable I get that the premise of this movie is already unbelievable but this really adds to it and makes it feel like a student film or something
I noticed theres a European man still playing the lead Jaw hits ground
Yall that are hating a movie which isnt premiering in a couple of days are acting like children
I guess its a good film to stay at home watching the classics
Another sequel  Hollywood is basically saying youre stupid  Very few original ideas   Im boycotting hollywood indefinetly
Hope she knows shes a fetish and guys are saying what they think she wants to hear I love thick as long as there is a shape there Not if you look like the girl who turned into a blueberry in Willy wonka
I dont like the look of this too Magicky Harry Potterycgiey etc I like Chalamet and feel a more grounded storydriven less effects laden film would work really well Ita a shame because the young Wonka is such a good idea for a film
absolutely LOVED with a capital L this trailer 
Damn this cgi
Mr Bean
Look another box office flop origin story Hollywood is so creativity bankrupt all they can do is prey on established properties and destroy them in the process Gene Wilder was a treasure and to think some low charisma hack like chalamet can fill that top hatgood luck
Someone vote for Mr Bean 
Why dose sound like nardward
Hollywood is over 
No
In 101 mrbean is now in the Wonka movie
This wasnt in the book
His father was Saruman  Christopher Lee No wonder Wonka has some magic
I was 100 expecting to hear his British accent  
I really hope it will be good
""
Why are there so many over the top positive spanish comments How much did they pay for fake reviews 
Timothy Chalamet is the worst choice for this role  overhyped actor
Stop remaking these fukking movies u fuktards
WTf is this
Looks dreadful
should I watch it
The colors seem off and dark
This looks like The Polar Express as a live action I am so excited and the music score for the trailer literally brings tears to my eyes every time 
why is charlie a black girl what are they trying to prove
The issue for me is that I dont see Willy Wonka I see TImothee Chalamet just winging it and acting like himself
Wow Seems like a steaming pile of garbage
Is this Willy Wonka gone woke
Im sorry I dont like that actor he just feels too normal like you know its a person acting and you dont feel the character in dune same way everyone had accents he had a normal American accent like what
How about we get EHRMANTRAUT next year 
I still think the 2005 version is better
Looks fun
Immediate hate Wonderful Just gotta love the internet in not even getting a chance
Ebaaaaaaaaa meu Amorzo 
He has magic Does this movie include magic and sort anyone
Great cast but  Why cant they just leave a Classic alone Surprised that Wonker wasnt a diverse woman this time 
why there are black people  There were no black people in Europe at that time  looks like a boring movie
Most awaited movie cant wait for this movie release
I need to catch up on my sleep This movie looks perfect
I enjoy him as an actor but I always picture Jeremey Allen White aka Lip Gallagher playing this role even before this movie was thought of 
Yey
Looks like another bad take on a classic And its a starts with Timothy Chalamets bland monotone performance that is already apparent in the trailers Made for the box office to hopefully bring in millions and fade away but will never get close to the original in terms of classics
Chocolate movie
NOPE Cancel this immediately before it bombs
More like Willy Wokea
Twinky twonka
ruined a classic  lost the real feeling of movies
Why tell the same story again and again  We already know what happens
Too bad Gene Wilder isnt around anymore to make a cameo
That movie aint gonna hit i seen to many remakes of movies which proves that the studios making it arent coming up with with original ideas any more and making remaking the same movies with shoddy quality which removes what made the movie special in the first place and also wonka sounds alot like mark rober
St Albans changed into winter land for a few  days is my best memory and seeing actors in the morning drinkingcoffeec
Why the F are they remaking this yet again No one asked for it
Who needed this  If you didnt like Gene Wilder you had Johnny Depp  vice versa  Like we dont have enough woke trash remakes
Oh good another woke remake that destroys the original story  Yay
Shouldve left it at Johnny Depp because wtf 
"Hollywood New ideas Original stories
Get outta my office "
Love how everyone is banging on about the original being best without having seen this despite the fact it is not even a remake Lots of Brits in the cast will make this EPIC
Why does every movie that has come out in the last year have African Americans as co starts and supporting actors Im seeing a trend
It looks great
This looks so stupid
This looks horrible
Looks like a watchable film
This movie looks ok so far but dont even think about watching it unless youve seen the original 1971 Willy Wonka 
"With El0n telling Disney to feck off Wonder whatll happen to Warner Bros etc once Peezagate become common knowledge 

Happy to repost EACH time you delete this comment boobtube"
omfg i legit thought this was aidan ghallagher this whole time turns out it was the guy who played dune 
I think Chalamets great but Depp much like he did with Captain Jack Sparrow really brought a certain Je ne said quoi to the Willie Wonka role and thats gonna be hard to top
Boy cott
Rowan Atkinson should have played Wonka What a missed opportunityI have feeling he has a bit part and the rest is garbage
Will this movie not be released in Indian theatre in Hindi language  Because I am a big fan of Sir Rowan Atkinson  Timothe Chalamets acting

"What a woke load of nonsense 
I would be more worried about being robbed"
They Casted the most goodie too shoe person ever to play as wonka
This looks terrible Hollywood trying to extend the list of classic characters and IPs they destroy I see
Glad i watched this trailer otherwise wld be a waste of time Unoriginal n suprises that turned disappointmemt
This actually looks magical compared to a lot of new movies
Why do I feel like disney ruined it
this looks really really bad
Looks really good but Gene Wilder will forever be Willy Wonka 
Discover how Sherman became WONKA
Willy Wonka is only Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp
looks as creepy as the other 2 films Im sure woke as well Pass
Hugh Grant as a badly animated Oompa Lumpa is the worst most annoying thing Ive seen since the SheHulk trailer I want to vomit
This is the first Willy Wonka I find attractive
There is only one Willy Wonka and he is Gene Wilder RIP sorry bus this Chalamet guy is not goog enough for the role
Jesus another one Of course Im gonna watch at some point in my life Am i gonna watch it in theaters No Does it look bad Yes
Heard of new willy wonka movie and am very disappointed to see chalomet
Yay another woke piece of garbage
We need old Wonka back
This is how you destroy the wonka universe worst pick as main character worst script damn just sad
This lacks the contrast between the ordinary and the extraordinary Also this Wonka isnt wonky Pass
It looks like a Wonderful Fantasy Christmas movie  about time
Mr bean
GRACIAS A DIOS QUE DISNEY NO METIO SUS ASQUEROSAS MANOS WOKE EN ESTA OBRA POR RESPETO A LOS NIOS Y A LO ESTABLECIDO
I wonder where the Americans love of the Irish people is now the Irish way of life is in trouble again
Charlie and the chocolate factory was one of my favorites movies Rip to Both Grandpa  Grandma Joe  Josephine George  Georgina
This was filmed in WonkaVision
Willy wonka and black girl 
Hes got the structure but not the voice Its not his fault Its extremely hard to follow up the true original
They should have just stopped with the Johnny Depp Willy wonka 
I have never beem a fan of any Wonka movie but this preview reminds me of Mary Poppins It does not look bad  just the feel of the movie makes me feel this  Or maybe a Harry Potters movie but it reminds me of something from the past
Going to be highly cringeworthy
Isnt Timothees Wonka just Daniel Thrasher
Just played as him in Lies of P and now hes Wonka Its a good year
Looks nothing like the first movie Diversity trash
I dont think hes fit to play wonka tbh he seems dull
Wowjonny deep
Hes way too flat and buttoned up for this role Needs some crack head energy And the oompa loompa doesnt make any sense at all ugh this sucks
So quite up and listen down
None of them beat the original version
"Sorry it looks pants ticking all the politically correct boxeswell apart from not using a real person of short stature for the oompa lumpa
Willy looks about 10 "
Who  wants to go with me to the cinema and obviously to watch it
another knock off gene wilder is the only one for me

But does he sing
Woke version

I guarantee you theyre gonna make Wonka the twist villain
Wow how beautiful  Its great to see that the UK used to be so diverse in the olden days Good thing there are films like this to teach us about how things used to be and to remind us how hiorrible we have become in modern times where marginalized people have no freedom and women arent allowed to participate in society or something  go ESG sarcasm
If I were to watch a cinematic display of Wakanda I would no expect to see a bright person
I think the character is a little too whimsical Far removed from the man indifferent about children dying on his factory tour
This movie looks lit i am gonna watch it on Christmas
Looks like one that I dont need to see  Why does it look generic  This is what AI films will be someday  a bunch of CGI and a bucket load of random pieces of different movies patched together and shatt out 
The OLD the Best
Phoenix Buchanan from Paddington 2 AKA Hugh Grant being an Oompa loompa I cant wait for this 
141 Wait is that mr bean
Not my Wonka
"I Cant Wait
Born 1969 taking my Grandaughter to see this"
They casted the wrong person for this role Not buying Chalemet as Wonka
its that guy that cant get th orange stuff off his face
the main character of the bear would have made a better wonka
Example of a movie that literally no one asked for
Long live Gene Wilder The real Willy Wonka
More woke trash avoid
Another Willie Wonka movie
115 Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity
Gonna bring my Golden ticket to the movie theaters watching this 
"why is everyone so hyped up this movie looks so GARBAGE 
1 The oompa loompas arent suppose to talk only when someone messed up
2 Wheres the classic chocalate factory with all the creative candy looking designs
3 Wheres Charlie
4 Wheres the golden ticket
5 The actor looks like a homeless man
They ruined Willy wonka"
Bring back Johnny Depp
Waste of a movie
Holy mackerel I I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS
This looks AWFULNo thank youStick with the one and only worth seeing  Gene Wilder in 1971 Willy Wonk  the Chocolate Factory  No need for a prequel if its garbage and doesnt even remotely align with what is supposed to have been the followup original
Looks terrible
This looks bad lmao sorry but its true
Boycotting  Free Palestine 
More wokeness No thanks
Wonka s Jonhie Deep
Not woke enough All characters should be played by black people
Do we really need another remake of this  Gene Wilder must be rolling over in his grave
I feel sorry for this guyhe is no Johnny Depp
I need this on Amazon please 
Looks amazing credit to Warner Bros Shame Disney dont make movies like this anymore
Im seeing it
"Im an old guyhavent been to the theater in agesbut this is one I want to see

I know its going to be incredibly entertaining and visually spectacular on the big screen"
Come on lads Marvels all over again
I dont know about this one
Another woke production
Its amazing how bad movies can be these days
He took my idea of making a Wonka movie about the beginning with a young Willy
Nothing says old London like diversity equity and inclusion Good thing they didnt hire real struggling little people who need work huh I guess its inclusive to not include
Looks great   Glad to hear that Timothe Chalamet is a big fan of the previous films  So respectful  charming  The ideal Willy Wonka
why did no one tell me this is a musical
Lets ruin another franchise is it
Why did we need this
Meanwhile in real life Paul Atreides is drowning his sorrows in spice
Why oh why the American accents 
Another woke movie
This looks dreadful and anyone whos looking forward to it is a bot
LMFAO
This trailer attempts to give off that old school feel but its way too peppy Gene Wilder had the ability to be both dark and fun
Dunno if its just me but this Wonka feels like a combination of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depps Wonkas
This might be the best iteration of Willy Wonka we will ever see
All these movies are stupidThere will never be one like Gene WilderThey have to remake to satisfy black peopleEvery movie has to include them for their new historyLmaoI would never spend a dimeI grew up with these moviesim not white nor blackThank godMy family have never judged anyone by skin colorbut when u watch news on tvit sure isnt Asianwhite kids stealing at major storesthrowing people on train tracksbeating up elderlyrobbing cab driversOhone more thingNo such thing as black Santa ClausEvery f commercial is just lying to kidsI believed in Santa Claus he is from the North poleNo black folks hang out in snownorth poleSanta has beautiful marble blue eyesLovely white beardhair Merry xmas all
"That chamalet guy cant do it Hes utterly void of any human feelings Hes a mothers fantasy son A selfish mother
Mark my words it wont do 330M WW 
Not much more at least"
Wow this looks utterly shite Congrats WB
Once weve started dancing we cant stop 
No thanks Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka  Period
When are movie folks going to come up with anything original Stop rehashing great movies
yes bravo
I cant wait
Noooo Willy Wonka has to be British It looks good tho especially Mathew Baytown from Horrible Histories being in it
Sorry but a no for me cant beat the 1971 version
Im a simple man I see mathew baynton in a trailer and I run to the cinema
Blasphemy Dont go there But I might stream it GENE IS WONKA 
Popcorn soda  chocolate 
Pg Christmas movies
Assume
They shouldve done a different film where Charlies actor from the original gives up the factory to the next person akin to Gene Wilder
This has NOTHING to do with the Willy Wonka
acho que essa ser a primeira vez que criticarei o Timotinho 
this should be the movie celebrating one hundred anniversary of warner brothers
I dont like itWonka with Deep is real Wonka
Yall need to get help There are people like me who have wanted a new Wonka movie for years And here we are months before the movie even released yall talking about how bad it is So judgmental smh
Jesus loves you Read the Bible
Im not waiting 28 days for this
Im sorry i know its not a remake but it doesnt make sense to have a prequel since the Wonka from the past never told about his mother at any point so adding a totally different plot and i question you why besides Thimothe is beautiful and yes i think its an honor to play the role of Willy one of the classics but we have to agree that he doesnt have the essence of Wonka his strange and eccentric way he just says things which leaves it like that but the expressions are always the same lol anyway
There were no African Americans in the original Willy Wonka so there should be none in this one either The era did not have them
WOKE GARBAGE
Willy Woke Wonka
Theres only one willy wonka
Trash without johnny
Mygod mister beannnn
This is the 3rd Willy Wonka movie that I know of there can be more but Hollywood is really out of ideas Original movies r dead now
I am glad this isnt just another recreation of the OG story
Oh its a prequel well I can agree with that
All this is is Hollywood making another fantasy movie thats unrealistic and made to make you feel bad about yourself then
Is this a prequel or something I dont see Charlie in the trailer 
only watching cause mr bean
Im so game Im on it
i dont like this so much chocolate in the move need more white chocolate
Lets keep remaking the same 20 movies that we know will sell instead of taking a risk on an original story
This looks horrible
What are we gonna do Willy Got me dying 
I dont think Roald Dahl would have approved of this if he was alive He didnt like the 1971 film Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
This looks awful
This looks horrible
If jonny deph anit part of it i aint watching it 
It looks really good I havent been excited to see a movie in so long I almost forgot how it feels
No one can replace johnny depp NO ONE
Twobit Gene Wilder impression
Im cool with an origin story l  
141 Father Blackadder and the Crisis of Faith
This looks boring af
Woke Wonka Lolz
This looks terrible
This movie is better than the others also with timothees classic line 
It takes a special type to pull off the role of Willy Wonka Id say Wilder Depp and Chalamet are as a worthy a trio as any
I still think Wonka should have been portrayed by a black female actress This movie perpetuates the patriarchy
Timothe as Willy Wonka Never wouldve expected it but I love him so Im excited
Man they brought back the original OompaLoompas and Im happy
Jesus come up with an original idea for once
Please Remove this Movie  we didnt ask for it
And hes too much of a weep with beyond low self esteem to be willy wonka LMAO
FREE PALESTINE
Sooo cancelled he made fun of dying Palestines in the snl show SHAME ON UUU
I liked my own comment 
You will never beat the original
Wow no any ideas of new films
He said skywalker
Hhhhhh
Suprised Wonka isnt black lmao 
I really hope this is a real good movie to the Willy Wonka franchise
056
Oh man I seriously thought this was Daniel Thrasher
Call me weird but Timothee looks even hotter in this willy wonka costume
I think I speak for everybody when I say they shouldve made Rowan Atkinson Willy Wonka this wouldve been hilarious and quite frankly Im kind of shocked that he took a side roll
I heard one of the Oompah Loompahs is going to be transgender
Nope
Im so excited for this u dont get it
The Wonka in this trailer doesnt depict any of the allusions of darkness that Wonka had in either of the two previous films that hinted at the deviousness of his nature The sort of mad scientist teetering between genius and insanity Someone whose passion led to obsession This one just says weird words with none of that in the delivery You could say its a prequel so he hasnt become that yet but I would argue its still less interesting so why bother  Thats a rhetorical question I mean the movie could be great but this trailer isnt selling me on it
cant say willie wonka a dumb race cant say 2 words its to complicated
please stop raping the things i loved as a child
Destroying a perfect and magnificent classic  somethings can never be duplicated  replaced nor surpassed
Of coarse it had to be a black chick Wtf this is gonna be woke
They better not ruin this
Poppy
Why is Willy Wonka a 15 year old
Rowan Atkinson  love this man
Ill rent it on home rentals or wait for it to come out on cable Not theater worthy and theaters are done
Nobody asked for this
"Look we ALL love Chalamet But for Willy Wonka Nope Not when we have a real life Willy Wonka in Ezra Miller You wouldnt even need a big budget just give him a briefcase full of chocolate and a documentary crew made up of singing  dancing excons all with Growth Hormone Deficiency to be his documentary crew and follow him everywhere and VOILA 
Ezra and the GHD Dancers will make Chocolately Magic with minors and wards of the state all around the world"
I miss the old wonka
Im sorry but he doesnt have Mr Depp personality 
Its clearly a prequel to the classic Willy Wonka film we know and love
Slugworth is white not black I knew this was going to be woke
035 the building actually looks like Gringotts Bank
noooo why didnt they cast johny depp again
Wtf why did they showcase Wonkas pet monkey more than Rowan Atkinson
Give it up leave the original movie alone OK 
The look and feel of this reminds me of Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium Dustin Hoffman Natalie Portman and Justin Bateman 
I like the way you baked it
You got to love the heat 
Fairy buds remember me as I was
Why so many chocolate people
Hugh Grant from Love Actually to an Oomba LoombaOut of a womans diary to a Chocolate FactoryWow
Ngl that police uniform is 
Its very hard to believe that man when he says Im Willy Wonka Not a good role for Chalamet
Im going to pass on this but I wish everyone the best
No wonder they dont want to pay writers more They cant even come up with originals This the SECOND remake of Willy Wonka Not interested
The acting looks awful  Johnny Depp played the perfect Willy Wonka This guy doesnt portray him right
YeahI think Ill stick to my WB boycott
Yeah this is definitely from the producer of Harry Potter I thought this was a fantastic beasts installment
This isnt Willy Wonka or Wonka cant we just keep the film with the funny man and the funny hair and not have this trash
"This is not Roald Dahls vision
How can this be Charlie and the Chocolate Factory if its Wonkas origin  must have an abundance of black actresses Will not be paying to see your diversity WB How ever could wonka have done it without a black girl and no midgets"
This young wonka isent hitting the magic of older wonka
im watching this only for the oompa loompas
Oh man this movie is ganna be awesome Take my money  
Terrrible casting
The sequel to this will be a prequel about Hugh Grants character  It will be called Loompa
Nobody asked for this If this doesnt rank Ill be so surprised unless every kid wants to see it
Hollywood has been out of ideas for a long time
Wow Im seriously happy for Lil Mabu making his debut as Willy Wonka Genuinely happy for the squirt
So Pixie dust is in the Chocolate Did WANKA kidnap Tinkerbell
Remember when Hollywood writers went on strike because they feared that AI would replace them and they werent paid enough Who needs them when everything coming out of Hollywood is a remake with a woke twist
Why would anyone ever watch this
Why
The moment when Wonka looked straight into the camera and said Im the one who Loompas was the moment he truly became Heisenwonka  Vince Gilligan really is the genius of our time
"I think they should have followed the story line But its whatever I just hope its not a waste of time in my life watching this 

The kid in the movie willy wonka with johnny Depp had access to the whole factory AND his secret ingredients to making the chocolate after being the last child to win at the end 

And i think if he had grown up and wonka had died and he tried to handle everything on his own it would have been a great story Definitely if he had succeeded through troubles of trying to figure it out 

THIS is completely off the originals And its basically a coin toss for bad or good"
cant wait for mr bean to be in this movie
Predictionpain
That chocolate that made you fly thats an edible
Its adorable
Ofc its him
It looks fun but did they read the book though
Willy w
Terrible CGi and its way too heart warming Not for me
Im gonna definitely enjoy this
Im Exicited for This Movie
this actually looks really interesting THIS is how you reboot
It would be awsome if johnny depp could have his cameo as the grown up willy wonka
It would be awsome if johnny depp could have his cameo as the grown up willy wonka
Caramel
King I would like to smoke with you donot run fire
Its 2023 why isnt Wonka a black female
"The original quote is 
STRIKE THAT REVERSE IT 
I quess to strike would seem masculine toxicity"
Man Timothe Chalamet is a talented actor I hope he becomes one of the greats
why tf is charlie black tho
This looks Bad
Ompa loompa cgi looks so bad omg
"Chalamet as Wonka 
Common"
they got a little kid playing willy wonka how cute
Reddit the movie
CORNYyy
142 Mr BeanRowan in the house
i think the marketing team just made it seem worse than it is but it seems kinda good
Is it too late to cancel
I only watch WB trailers to find subliminal pedophile messages
Pretty much every comment here seem fake
Other than the floating candy this seems like it could be any other movie or even plot just exchange chocolatier and chocolate factory He does not have the charismatic eccentricity whether Wilder or Depp flavored
Where is Charlie
The lead actor performance is cringe worthy  What a let down from the Wilder and Depp
Oh no I knew they were gonna include diversity cast just for the sake of it in a time where it doesnt belong I was excited but now Im gonna have to pass on this one
They could have made Devine Brown an Oompa Loompa too
Time to go back to the movies this Christmas with my daughter Erika and her boyfriend
The original is always the best 
"WARNER BROS RAN OUT OF IDEAS  THE THIRD REMAKE  R U KIDDING ME  
GIVE US A BREAK"
This is disappointing Timothy ruins it for me
Stop with the God damn rehashed movies
They had to add a dose of Woke didnt they 
Nothing can top the original
Some serious nods to Gene Wilder and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Hopefully this film does it justice
What a shame
"He is too normal 
Worst cast "
This looks stupid gratuitous and retarded
prefer depps adaptation and the vibe was different too it had a somewhat disturbing tone to it with the crazy kids too this seems too innocent
Always a black and white thing Ruin another good memory
This is gonna be a great movie when I watch it
I dont think we needed this Why does Hollywood have the need to remake and destroy classics
My favorite part was when I stayed home and watched the original Willy Wonka movie
if they have rowan in it  ykits a banger
Is dat lil mabu
NOOO THEY TURNED LITTLE CHARLIE INTO A CHOCOLATE WOMAN
Oh I love this film already
Yet ANOTHER Willy Wonka movie This is exactly what audiences have been asking for How did they know we needed a 3rd Willy Wonka movie But this time lets delve into his back story
Disneys agenda checklist hard at work here Looks horrible
Looks stupid
Meh no
"Oh man its a prequel to the original WWATCF not the 2005 one
What a shame I aint gonna watch it"
Looks like hot garbage But on the plus side it looks like they got all the boxes checked off for equity and inclusion
I heard that the oopma loompa looks similar to the 1971 flim called Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory
The movie no one wants or cares about
Johnson from Peep Show Paterson Joseph is Slugworth I noticed him in a recent tetley ad on the radio too I dont think Ive ever seen him in a major movie It looks like a fun xmas family movie 87K dislikes so far however suggests fair criticism for a trailer At the moment youll have one half of social media screaming its too pc and the other screaming at Hugh Grant for potentially stealing a height challenged role Lol The only real disappointing thing is that its yet another remake in all honesty Its clearly largely a UK production given the majority of the cast Lets hope Rowan Atkinson has a Bean like role unlikely but you can always hope
Ill stick with the original like all the great movies 80s and before
A little on the WOKE side but no surprise here And the OscarBy regulation will not go to Willie Just saying What a wonderful world
mr bean in here too
MARY FROM PADDINGTON
Kids might like it
I loved the part where Willem Dafoes Norman Osborne said Im something of a chocolatier myself really made me understand his relationship to both Peter Parker and Willy Wonka 
The obligatory black female lead role is kinda whack
Looks more like Wakanda than 1930s England Wtf is this trash
Yes more black people inserted for no reason No thanks
"Didnt we already have the remake of this with depp 
That flopped 
How unimaginably original by Hollywood A film nobody asked for again"
""
a WOKE Wonka
Im a kid from the 80s No Willy Wonka will ever be as good as Gene Wilder That Willy Wonka movie will never be topped This looks fantastically terrible
MR BEAN
Are there any original ideas
You got Mr Bean in this movie
First Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory1971 then Charlie and the Chocolate Factory2005 and now Wonka2023
Nope Just nope  You can never beat Classic with Gene wilder This actually looks very Disney and thats a huge insult 
dont need another remake WB
why do they have to keep redoing these masterpieces
Im glad they always replenishing the Walmart discount bins with new variety 
Woke 
I love that little easter egg at 150 Mary from Paddington
I dont remember africans all over the place in the first wonka African cops in Victorian england SUREEE OK what planet is this move set in Its not earth
Willy Woke
"Its a woke version Checking all the boxes of that virtual signaling  propaganda So how many indigenous people where successful in 1930s England 
Why is it so important to fake history Embrace what it was and for Gods sake tell the truth For once"
Ew
Even the trailer has a stolen joke  Thats not a good sign
Tf was that
New movie
We didnt need a 3rd movie
Wonka in the reichstag
Hes no gene wilder
Wait  Charlie is now a Black girl
This has nothing to do with the actual story  He doesnt fit the look  He still resembles a child  SMH He had issues with his father and abandonment He found family NOT LOVE This is all wrong 
Hugh grant is oompa loompa  Oooo I will see it I want to see an oompa loompa with British accent
This looks like hot trash from a dumpster fire They shouldve called it Willy Wokea
Ya know what made the 60s version great A fantastical shop situated in a grim semirealistic world Here the real world is already fantastical so whats the conflict Bahhhh who cares itll be a fun thing to watch with the fam

They ruined another classic
25 stars Maybe
141 MrBeaaannnn
Please god dont be Willy Woman and the Woke Factory please 
Whats the point Its impossible to improve on Gene Wilder and the charm and real special effects in the original
From Gene Wilder to this Sad times
"first we had Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory movie  1971  then we had Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 2005
now were getting a new movie  called Wonka 2023


im shocked to know its the movie that shows Wonkas eary days before the Factory and on how he came to be"
A Willy Wonka origins movie were beyond scraping the barrel at this point Were licking the timber
Gene Wilder is the only Willy Wonka
""
Yup I absolutely wont be watching this Originality is dead
In the current era of movies I could honestly do with some whimsy from a childhood classic IP Looking forward to it
As soon as I heard jarvis speak as the ompa lompa D I smiled
What a shame Its almost like Hollywood has no clue what made the first movie great
Finally a Snowpiercer prequel
CGI massacre
Blacksuns GEEA  WONKA
Idk about his acting on this Im not sold on the wackyness seems held back
Its too late Ive started dancing now 
Will it be a musical movie Like disney
I feel like its a nerdy kids saying coll phrases making him seem weird or trying too hard to fit in I dont like it
Who asked for this
Marilyn Manson needs to be MrWonka This looks really Lame
""
"437K versus 87K The fact one in five are dislikes is kind of telling Forced diversity hires are easy to spot and Timothe Chalamet as Willie isnt exactly what I had in mind Hugh as a Loompa is perfect casting however 
Kinda sad were now at the point where after several reimaginings of the same book were now making a prequel of it Cant we do anything original anymore
Ill wait until its blown over wait for proper reviews before throwing money at this"
Woke Wanka Cant Wait
Jhonny Deep es irremplazablesorry Timoteo
Another flop
Looks Weird not buying his acting at all for playing Willy Wonka Looks like hes trying to hard to be someone hes not Hard Pass
ESG DEI WOKE MADNESS
Why havent I heard of this until just now And it was only because I got a notification from my local theater
Chalamets lack of acting ability really shines here
BOYCOTTTT Filthy Zionist 
Wow Looks pure poo
We really didnt need this
Wonka goes woke
Meh
Come on 
Love Hugh Grant in this role
Its not the same without gene wilder he is the real Willy wonka
""
Wow cant wait to see this amazing movie
Love it when Uncle Ben says with Great White Chocolate come Great White Chocolate Power
Ill just watch the old ones
I really hope the movie is better then the trailer This looks terrible the acting looks  horrific But it is just a trailer
Why
I cant wait to see this movie  the cast sounds brilliant 
Miss you Johny depp
102 Hold up is that Rowan Atkinson
I can not wait to see it
Should have been called Woka
Rowan attinkson 103
This dude plays a HORRIBLE wonka what were they thinking
The new willy wonka 
This doesnt look interesting but I hope it is interesting
Iv always liked Willy Wonka because hes a cannibal
Dissapointed
Youll never surpass the charm of the first movie So why try
I dont think anyone wanted a Wonka origins story Oh well
Now He looks like Wonka
How many times does this movie need to be remade  LOL
The chalamet dude as wonka just feels wrong tbh
anyone came from him that vid of timothee promoting it 
Skip it and watch the original  Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka  No one else
this this movie has magic
"My sisters just told me about this film What a sweet surprise I cant wait to see it
Thanks 
Oompa loompa doompadeedoo "
I wonder how it would be like to see Wonka meet the Doctor from Doctor Who Miss Frizzle James Bond and Mary Poppins
Yes please
Jhonny Depp 
No one can beat gene
chalamet wonka
free palestane
Any chance Hollywood could greenlight a new idea
102 Mr bean 141 afraid Mr bean
18 years after 2005
Kinda cringe no one beats Johnny
Another great classic gets the woke treatment Roald Dahl must be turning in his grave
I got chills when he said here we go  momma
I love the idea of this and look forward to watch this but I do also believe that the lines were delivered a bit flatly The previous Wonkas were more crazy if thats the right word whereas this one seems more normal
Roald Dahl didnt even approve of the original movie He must be rolling in his grave right now
Did not spark my interest 
 j
From my view the plot is amazing as I love willy wonka films  but not all of this film is good  I belive that  the special efects are very  simple to be in 2023 but it has also good things like the setting  From my poin t of view the film is  recrated in the good timeThere are not many things to say abaut the soundtrack  is good althought I think that is the sama in all scenes  It is a good film I recommend it
If you look closely at the girl during the huh scene you can see her looking at the script to see her next line bruh
I cant wait to not watch this junk
Looking forward
""
Everything is a damn remake these days Make something new thats a classic for once ffs
Think Ill stick with the original that wasnt concerned with quotas in films
I didnt even recognise Keegan at first LMAO
Loved the book Loved the original film Cant wait
No thanks Theres only one Wonka
i am not feeling this version at all What made the first one the best is the sarcasmThis movie doesnt have it Plus this movie is too magical The first one was simple and right to the point This one is too bubbly I am just not feeling it
"I love it the film is very gripping because is a film that is isnt predictable
In my view the especial effects are fantastic and the characters too the plot is believable and the soundtrack the best
I love the film Is the best film ever is very interesting and funny too
The best is that is suitable for very age"
"From my point of view the trailer is not something that attract attention
I dont see the relationship with the original film  Its  looks like a slow and boring movie the only thing I can talk well is about the actor who interprets Willy Wonka they made a good choice in the actor The plot wasnt interesting and the soundtrackanything special but the special effects wasnt bad but too basic for this charming movie "
I like this trailer because take about Chocolateis incredible becasuse it has may special effects and that makes it attrac more atention
"From my point of view the film is very fascinating it is slowly and charming film but I think the plot is too disappointing the soundtrack is pleasant and the special effects are normal
I like the character of Wily Wonka because he is very charming I love this film 
I saw this movie many times when I was little"
Wow from Johnny Depp to Timothee Chalamet Super love
I Cant Wait
This looks amazing
The fact that he says Scratch That Reverse it and not Strike That Reverse It already make this a classic
Lets Gooooooooo
Anyone can do Wonka better than Depp that was just awful
he reminds me so much of bernard the elf
The fact that Danny devito isnt the Oompa Loompa hurts my very soul
215 I have a feeling that will transition into a musical number in the movie
Looks promising but Wonka is a hard character to play I dont see it
"The trailer got me so bored  
Pass"
"127 Hes good 
Too good"
Another sugar coated movie Sell outs
This is meh but Ill watch it for Olivia Colman
Fantastic
I love this trailer Really this trailer has all comedy actionIt is the Best trailer I could seeThe soundtrack is surprising the characters are interesting and so funny my favorite is WonkaThe custome designer is wonderful It is so elegantThe plot is thrilling and the special effects are fascinatingReally I recommend this film if You like fiction movies
"Hi everyone
I think that the trailer is really goodthe soundtrack is too loud for me but I guess my ears are the sensitive oneshaha
AnywaysI feel like the plot is really interestingthrilling and hilarious lol 
The characters are amusing but the Oompa Loompa is quite interestingI guess
I meanits funnybut it reminds me of a tomato or a watermelonLMAO 
Its also quite surprising to see his size my nephew is taller than the Oompa Loompa and hes only 8 years oldHAHAHAHAHA
Anywayshave a good day and thanks for riding this "
I love this film In my opinion that the soundtrack is perfect to the film becouse sounds like magic There are some amazing  specials effects that comes you to other magic world From my point of view the characters are fantastic and the oufits are so good
In my opinion the Wonka trailer is very good because it has a very good soundtrack a good plot it is science fiction but it does not have many special effects and the characters are different than the first movie but they are good
Nope too politically correct for me not true to the time period of the film typical of these days 
This looks stupid
I want to see the movie since it is a mix of Christmas and magic and you might know more about the story
In my view it is very interesting and  fascinating The character are the best because he si very funny The soundtrack is surprising
In my humble opinion this is one of the most surprising movies I have ever seen Is gripping because Willy Wonka has a charming personality I believe that It has a spectacular special effects and a predecible soundtrack because is the same that the first film of Willy Wonka In conclusion  Im looking forward to seeing this movie
I believe the plot is interesting surprising and it thought provoking because leaves you with intrigue From my point of view the characters are gripping because they speak with ellipses and they ate curious I feel the soundtrack is surprising because is noisy and suddenly is silence and it is little disgusting My point in special effects is pleasant and good
From my point of view the trailer is amazingthe plot is very grippingthe soundtrack is slowthe character is suprising because there are a lot of typeand the special effect is fascinantingI want to wacht this film
I love this trailer because Im mad about chocolate From my point of view the characters are very cheerful and crazy I think the plot is very surprising and special effects are fascinating Beside the soundtrack is wonderful
Its literally insane how ALL THEY HAD TO DO was not cast Timothee Chalamet
Why
The Key phrase  Every Good thing in this world started with dream which is the soul of this movie
Hes just not wonka enough idk Wilder and Depp set the bar too high imo this has tv movie vibe like abc family 
Flop
Something original for the love of god
So Roald Dahl DIDNT write a prequel to Willie Wonka  Someone else has written it and decided for him what his characters origin story is  Wonderful  not
In my opinion the trailer is really cool I love the costumes and the decorations The plot seems really interesting The characters are very different and there are a lot From my point of view the soundtrack isnt something really remarkable but Im not saying that its bad at all The special effects are so real impressive I think they look so real
I loved the original Willy Wonka but I think this looks pretty good 
They forgot to add in his dad being the dentist 
Looks 
Im not feeling it  Gene Wilder will always be the real Willy Wonka
Looks absolutely pathetic
Tarea 17
Missed chance to make his origin story into a horror
The dude in the thumbnail looks like the dude from Lies of P
dark white nutty absolutely insane is one of the most cringeinducing deliveries of a line Ive ever seen
What happened to house atreides
This is so dumb
Looks as stupid as the Johnny Depp disaster
I love that part in 1971 but kinda cool 
Most uncharismatic Willy Wonka
Well chocolate was discovered by the Mayans in Mexico I hope GenZ wont believe this movie as real history
Genial

Timothee Chalamet channeling his inner Gene Wilder  Johnny Depp 
Woka and the equity factory
Ive not been this excited over a films release for a good few years especially when I found out Simon Farnaby and Paul King were behind it Cant wait
More Chocolate People please
nice to see peep show carrying the casting
Bring back the original cast is amazing from jhonny deep one is amazing
Perfecta me gusta
that aint willy wonka thats jilly jonka
152 me after I put my moms house as collateral for the 27leg parlay I just made
mr beannnnnn
I loved the part where chamalet  Just chamaleted
whatever that actor is the age is not appropriate for the role thus this movie is instanly irrelevant
"No matter how good the movie is wont be the same without Johnny Depp
Something still missing"
Yaaawn WB ruins a timeless classic Cant wait to see Netflix blow them out the water
well thats a first seeing a run away giraffe in this new willy wonka movie
Me gusta
The actress who acted as the mother of charlie and the chocolate factory is in this movie
Fk your remake
No
I personally liked the original 1970s movie the best and at 152  just that 2 seconds made me so incredibly happy I hope they sing pure imagination or at least the theme Oh man 
Timothee acting in this trailer is a lot more like peter parker then Willy wonka
Totally nostalgic Totally magical I always miss story Anyway cant they make a sequel after the prequel
So what happens that there are no longer people of Color later in the storytimeline
Little people should be getting these roles Its crazy they call it pc however they are taking jobs from people I will be boycotting this movie just like Snow White I hope they start giving these people their roles back
Woke garbage
"Again another complete waste of time and money making a trashRubbish garbage remake of a classic
Ths is definitely taken it to far
Again leave the Originals Alone  as you cant change them and give only what the originals have that makes them special 
Its been done many times and failed very badly 
There will be those many who will love this remake for whatever lack of very bad knowledge understanding only the Originals are always the real true classic Best
It was exactly the same with the Remake of Annie and the Remake of Witches
Leave the originals alone as no matter how many times a remake with changes just doesnt have that same feeling as the originals 
How anyone would like this i wont ever know or understand 
Remakes are a waste of time money and are only TrashRubbish Garbage for the Litter trash rubbish garbage Bin"
Looks awful 
I cant wait to see this because Timmy has a way of making everything great
i love the part where will wonk setup a puppet government in Mogadishu to get the exclusive rights to the Cacao tree
Im sorry but timothee as Wonka is so random and honestly its kinda bad performance for willy wonka
yeah no
"Runawayyyy
0141"
A Trilogy This is my hopethis film Charlie and the Chocolate factory for part 2 then finished up with The Great Glass Elevatorps if this wasnt the film companys original ideaI will take royalties
Total garbage Horrible casting and acting I love the two books and the original movie Roald Dahl is spinning in his grave
"BLACKWASH
BOYCOTT THE BLACKWASH"

There are WAY too many chcocolate people in my chocolate man movie Race hire quotas EVERYWHERE  its better without the chocolate people Chocolate is always sweeter with less diversity
what does kylie jenner feels about this i wonder
Looks like any cringe Junior High first year stage play And of course forced dIvErSiTy Mr Bean deserved better
Willy WOKE opss Wonka  BLACK 
And still no real life Legendary Wonka Bar  F you 
205
I dunno its hard to hold a candle to Genes whirlwind performance but an origin story is cool Hugh on the other hand was an awesome choice
To everyone who thinks Chalamet is not fit to play Willy Wonka thats nonsense Hes a great actor whom I think really fits the character of Willy Wonka He also looks similar to Gene Wilder
154
Gerekten harika bir senaryo ve mkemmel bir hayal gc sabrszlkla bekliyorum
ok gzel harika
Is this a sequel or a prequel
The trailer made me cry already before the actual movie did 
Is this a musical movie
One name Gene wilder no matter how many times you remake it its never going to be better than the first one
I just want to see the sword he keeps hidden in the cane
Interesante y entretenida pelcula no se la pierda

Very good entertainment movie for the whole family
Espero que llene las taquillas en el estreno y tengo varios premios
"Esta es una pelcula obligatoria de ver si o si me gust mucho la trama
La recomiendo a todos"
Se ve que estar buena y es la tercera en el reparto
Excelente pelcula
Super atrapante
Me encanto desde el principio la mejor  que e visto
It will be interesting to know the life of Willy Wonka
Me encanta te atrapa desde el inicio excelente produccin
Genial
Perfecta pelcula 
Willy Woka What kind of Wonkas came up with this idea
i hope the chartel wins
Ngl from the thumbnail I thought they made willy Wonka black
Breathtakingly bad 
Why do they discriminate agains little people actors This is basically black face Do better hollywood
Looks horrible
Cant they make any NEW movies
This looks truly awful
"George Weasley is Willy Wonka
Change my mind"
i love you daddy Willy
I wish it had been played by Jhonny Depp 
Mehhh
Wheres the space exploration
Can someone tell me why chocolate maker isnt played by black or brown 
Chalamet looks forgettable in this
KAR DO
This is my inspiration for tending my portfolio brand right noowww
Why not cast actual little ppl as oompa loompas like the OG Willy Wanka and the chocolate factory They were great
Guys Im only here bc ok Katys impression of Alyssa Edwards as Willy Wonka
"Ill give it a shot it looks charming
Lets see what this can be"
Woke Wonka  Culturally appropriating another classic  Glad to see the writers are still on strike
Might see it just for Keegan Michael Key Hes funny af in every role
Why is no one talking about how Mathew Baynton is in this movie
cant wait to watch this while eating lots of chocolates
Looks extremely uninteresting They have to stop rebooting what was already perfect
Watching Dune 2 and then watching this will be crazy
Literally couldnt even get through the trailer its so cringe  Damn
People cant make anything original anymore
"Thanks but its an absolutely not from me
"
So Mr Wonka weve examined your loan application and I just have one question for you Are you a pathetic worthless punk
Wonka is getting younger and younger
Once againchanging the story
ALYSSA EDWARDS REALNESS
I love how deliciously whimsical a chocolate cartel sounds Genuinely looking forward to the spider reviews to follow
Not that this is a huge deal but this movie has retconned the Oompa Loompa origin in the book and the Tim Burton movie Willy Wonka only met the Oompa Loompa in a tribe It doesnt matter much but it is cool to spot a retcon for myself
Warner Bros THANK YOU FOR REMAKE WILLY WONKA AS MY HISTORY MARK Im still SELLING EXPENSIVE FOOD SALE CHEAP PRICE FOR THE POOR BY MY SECRET LINE OF BUSINESS
every good thing started with a dream Hitler fades in
go timothee give us absolutely nothing with that line delivery
we ready
This genuinely looks horrible
Please dont make it woke Warner Bros
Willy Wonka and the CHOCOLATE  factory  sit this one out Shame Thats becoming a trend
They shouldve had him as Charlie bucket since at the end of the original Charlie and the chocolate factory movie ending Charlie got the factory
I love the part where Timothy said no scratch that reverse it and scratched that and reversed it all around Truly a must watch movie
"Come with me to a world of pure imagination

 Gene Wilder Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory"
Lisan al Gaib
Trailers
"Look at all the BoT comments
"
How did he gain the ability to be casually snarky and subtly creepy as he got older The character is too clean and bright I dont feel like this is the kinda of person willing to take risks and seek out the unique
ook gzell
Its not bashing as a fan of the old and remake movie i feel like Timothee is not that good at delivering lines and his facial expression is not convincing But I do hope its only in the trailer
Mr Bean Omg my mom would have loved this movie makes me sad she passed in 2011 I was watching The Voice and forwarded thru the commercial thinking this was just another remake but came here to watch the Trailer and wow Looks fantastic Wish you were here mom 
Hollywood couldnt come up with an original idea if its greasy depraved life depended on it Pitiful
Just came here for Rowan Atkinson
The beginning is a jumpscare
This looks terrible
Looks good
Another
Skip and watch the original
I cant wait to see this movie
Looks absolutely idiotic
HughmpaGrantmpa is actually amazing I hate his guts but he seems actually hilarious in the role He was born to play an oompaloompa
They should have hired Johny Depp
So is the black girl playing the role of charlie Interesting 
Im sorry but no
I would love if the connect a Paddington cameo
Hollywood just when I thought  I was out you bring me back in with this masterpiece
Willie Woka
Gene Wilder said the other remake was an insult I believe this one is too You cant overcome the greatness of the first one Its too beautiful and unique No one can top it They should stop messing with this movie
He spent the past seven years searching for and enslaving Pygmies to make his chocolate
I think Im going to barf
Is this the Daniel thrasher movie
I like how they made this like a new movie and not a remake of the original that would have ruined it for me now I might actually watch it
Why does he talk like he has autism like an anime kid  YOU SEE IM SOMETHING OF A MAGICIAN  Jfc just stop
I really like the part where they took the skeleton of a masterpiece and reworked it into marvelquipping trash
Chalamet was nooooot the move
Why did they have to put Rowan Atkinson as a priest in this movie Laughing at ones religion is not fine but Roman Catholics somehow are an exception
PLLLLS do not ruim my Will wonka and the chocolate factory memories
eff off with all the contrived diversity its our european heritage they are crapping on
This has Mr Bean in it Why not just lead with that
Yall can shove Timothy up yours Not watching this washed and rewashed trash
byk bi sabrszlkla bekliyorum
MR BEAN TT
this is cringe worthy
Wonka is a great movie
His face like Charlie Puth
awful looks absolutely awful
Waiting thala 
The lines feel too normal hes supposed to be an oddball I really like Johnny Depps version cause we was clearly a wacko But this is just not strange enough
Im 52 years old  I can not WAIT  WOOOOOOOOOOOO
omg the trailer gives me goosebumps cant wait to see it
""
Seems a little tacky
Absolutely ridiculous Leave the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka alone you CANNOT improve on perfection Please stop trying And this is freaking bazaar 
Fun Fact all the smart people dont realize this is a origin movie instead theyre busy screaming Remake
Only thing weird is how they took this in a more magical direction Even adult Wonka hadnt perfected Fizzy lifting drink and all of his inventions had strange side effects This younger Wonka seems too perfect
This is a complete disgrace and bastardization of dahls work   More like Wokea     This negrophilia is absolutely insane  Is Mike TV a transvestite
Do we need this We already have to versions of the movie
Lil Mabu making chocolate instead of bread now
Too bad Timothee Chalamet is in it Worst actor ever
I hate this so much 
Not enought insanity for me I like my wonka unhinged
How dumb The original wasnt diverse enough and had too many midgets
The new generation cant make anything of their own they have to keep rehashing what my generation grew up with Pretty lazy and lame
The best trailer ive ever seen this yearthis movie definitely worth to wait 
Of course they have to put tokens in the movie
Another garbage remake
No thanks WB has proven they support abusers and punish victims I will not support them in any way ever again Also stop remaking wonderful movies into garbage Come up with something original for once
"aw Sorry Im Going to pass this Movie who Really behind it somebody will Be deep angered Who touched the Hll this Remake
GO BACK and CRITICISM alike Movie Sonic way and fired this New whiter shouldnt Needed ban them has No Excuse touching a New
Journey by this Movie 
what a Psych move is That"
Wonka is white and not black Is the world finally healing Thank God
Iy br kno sper 10 Nomura 5 yuldz
This trailer is just to much tries way to hard
No 
Where did these blacks come from I didnt see any in the original
"ANOTHER ONE

Stop remaking classics and MAKE NEW MOVIES WITH FRESH IDEAS

THAT ARENT WOKE"
Johnny Depp was so incredibly amazing in this role that even great actors like Timothy give it a shot and are just bland Ill pass
boring
Who is the black child with him This looking like a Sally Hemmings tale
Gotta be honest with yall Im only watching this movie because Rowan Atkinson is in it
WB running out of ideas lol
Mr Beannnnnnnnn
Are dwarves not allowed to act  anymore
"Ive started dancing now Once we started we cant stop 
"
I got zero sense of the absurd wonder I would want from a Wonka film
Since this is a modern day adaptation I wanna know which character is lgbtq2ai
A lot of people hating on this movie but watch how packed opening night gonna be and how fast them tickets going to sale 
It actually looks kinda interesting It seems to be a prequil of sorts of how wonka came to be
So basicallyWonka Begin
Its going to flop  Just by this trailer it seems that they want to make it goofy and have some sort emotional back story with wacky situations  And random wacky characters and dance numbers Ughflop
Why do we keep recreating the same movie over and over again
Oh look another example of racism in Hollywood
Too many wakandans running around in my chocolate man movie
How many race quota hires did you spot in this add AnswerTOO MANY
This trailer gave me cancer
Trailers from Disney movies are all the same there is no color in the movie Chalameet is flat as a punctured tyre it has no punch WHy people would pay to watch this
Will see it
Is Christopher Lee voice used in this
Do we really need another incarnation of this story I think not
no
103 
Keegan Michael key and Mr Bean along with the Christmas vibes is all I needed to be sold on this movie 
Looks blah to me
This kid has a great future Amazing actor
Please dont be woke
Finally something an inhumane world can come together with  And its the only thing we all have in commonthe sweet power and willing surrender of chocolate
"I do not know how to feel about this
I can only say for certain that I am intrigued"
No one will beat Gene Wilders performance Back then you didnt need cgi Just talent Neither Depp or Chalamet have the edge needed for this role and Wilder had that You never knew what Wonkas next move was in the original
Gotta add woke crapola Sure Boycotting is easy Always with the race swapping nonsense
Nice scenery but looks uninspiring Wonka was a complicated character to understand but this version looks like some nonbinary teenie bopper Im sure theyll be some hidden message about white supremacy or open borders in the movie lol
Omg i hafta see that for all my childhood imaginations of how it all started 
I love how they mention who produced it but at the end of the day a producers is just somebody who gives money it doesnt mean its going to be as good as other movies theyve produced
Im sorrywho asked for this
This plays like an online training course Zero interest in watching it
wow another original movie not made from movies that already exist  hollywood doesnt have imagination and creation to make new movies and bad casting this actor does give off any type of vibe from willy before or after he went insane hes trying to be so goofy and lines are so flat of emotion Ezra miller wouldve been perfect if he wasnt a st person
This is all Amber Turds fault 
who up willying they wanka rn
L
Willy Woke looks terrible
Omg I sooooooooo want to see this looks awesome Finally a good movie
This looks bad imo
"HUGH LAURIE not Hugh Grant
Dr House"
Finally Another Movie I want to see First Oppenheimer Second Barbie Now third Wanka
Ill watch it even though hes dating a Kardashian
Dont remake it Just dont 
Really Timothee dude as wonka
"I just cant after gene wilder and johnny d Nah
    Honestly I expected them to cast like Jaden Smith as Willy Wonka "
I cant believe its taken this long
Anotha one
Is dead on arrival
Nope
Negative not even five seconds into the trailer and Im turned off
It will never ever ever be like the original
"Wow I cant wait to see Wonka Begins The Imaginening Were finally getting our introduction to the Wonkaverse

Actually scratch that and reverse it this looks like a steaming heap of Oompa Loompa droppings"
Scissorhands was original and good without being twistedly weird Maybe this can erase the dumpster fire that  Burton  Depp created And lead to another chapter everyone can enjoy
Ew no
DINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDINGDING
JUST ME OR DOES THE PERSON PLAYING WILLY WONKA LOOK LIKE REGULUS BLACK
Dune
eww
""
Cant wait to see this love Timothee Chalamet
I wouldnt say I like it when the workers are mean to Willy Theyre jealous because hes about to become the greatest chocolate in the factorys history
Uh oh remember what the maga crowd did when there was a black Ariel oh boy
at first i was like nahh then when i seen the picture and now the character in motion all i could think about was seeing a young gene wilder but then the music kicks in and then we have hugh grant as a oompa loompai need to see this movie
025 Kween Mathilda reference lmaooo
MehIll take the Gene Wilder version over any of these other versions
Why are the slaves so much smaller in this film
Why do they keep remaking this
The way he says his lines makes me physically wince If those were the best takes they got Id love to see the worse ones
A kardashiam is now willy wonka smh unreal only in america we idolize whores
Him and Tom Holland are my favorite actors 
idk how much willy I can wonka anymore
"Im sure itll be a good movie but I do think that there movies about reall life candy makers

People like Milton Hershey and HB Reese"
I think this will be a good movie I like how it shows us how optimistic Willy was before he went completely crazy Yeah hes a little insane in this one but I think it makes for a nice prequel movie I think they definitely picked the right actor to play Willy wonka
anybody wonking their willy rn
I hop to see this movie 
talk about missing the entire point of the original novel
Oh no this looks so bad
Im taking my nieces and nephews to go watch this when it comes out
oh boy more uninspired trash boy am I excited
"Im so happy Disney is not involved in this movie
Ty Warner Brothers"
This looks like utter garbage
Looks woke
johnny depp with anorexia
What i didnt know mr bean will be in this movie as priest
Americans trying to sound more british and dignified is something that should be illegal
Nope
Gk ada duit mau nonton aku
Im excited for Gene Wilders evil capitalist origin story honestly Ill be watching it as such
As a stand alone sure As a Gene Wilder prequel seems to over the top to be it The original was grounded more then this goofy feeling harry potter universe movie
Come with meand youll be in a world of pure imagination
Why did they remake again We dont need another Willy Wonka movieauuuuugh
Absolute AIDS
I hate hollywood
020 THATS ALYSSA EDWARDS
tv Hes everywhere because women like him and women watch more tv than men now Get over it dweebs
When this trailer came on in my theater these group of girls all screamed TIMMY It was hilarious  Im so excited for this movie
O Finally AHHHHHHH now im excited
the 2005 one was enough  why this waste of time
per usual another musical that gets disguised as a straight drama in its trailerwhat is so scary about song and dance
Just be grateful Disney isnt making this film
When Wonka said Make it so He warped into chocolate history
Daniel Thrasher really stepping out of his element here
hes making chocolate of course
I have always enjoyed this book a very different version a good trailer Well done all for this production
AGAIN
The 2nd willy wonka look better
WE CANT HAVE THIS ON EARTH ITS CURSED
I just know 006 will be used for Crimson River edits
I was excited to see this movie but when i was there is no jhonny depp i was 
Tim chalamet is channeling the spirit of gene wilder in ths movie
Mrs Brown from Paddington is in it
118 is a Freemason reference with Wonka standing in the middle of the North Star Polaris which is Lucifer btw and the people rotating around him as the stars rotate around Polaris unbelievable they just cant stop
Ever since I saw Katya say Im making chocolate of course was Alyssa Edwards I cant unsee it lmao
Soulless dreck
I AM SOOO WATCHING THIS FOR MAT BAYNTON AND SIMON FARNABY MY KINGS
Everytime they remake a movie it gets worse
Too many black peepo  ill pass
Im a fan of Charlie and the chocolate factory movie i love that character of willy Wonka act by Jonny Depp his acting was superb i wish to see Johnny depp as Willy Wonka again 
I hope this movie is a musical movie 
Hmmm  no
Wow looks great
this is going to get AWFUL reviews like less than 65 on iMDB 
literal chills when he says its wonkin time
how many willy wonkas there gonna be
134 its the horrible histories guy
Looks awful Such a miscasting
Am I the only one sick of remakes Just create new stories damn
That looks very interesting and delicious Thats gonna be the best Wonka movie ever
What makes no sense to me is didnt wanka have human employees until he shut it down So why not just cast human people for the beginning of his career but 
I cant wait for this
This movie looks trash and terrible then the original
Mr bean
018 an alyssa edwards cameo
Man like modded controller 360 
"Lsplash come get your damn spider 




Its making chocolate"
Mr Bean voice at 143 ha ha
What an abomination of willy wonka
Before Charlie Buckets dreams came truethere was a time when Willy Wonkas dreams came true
Wait did mr bean just talk
019  Alyssa Edwards
018 He really does sound like Alyssa Edwards  Im makin chocolate of course For the friends family fans and the folks at home
Cant wait to see how this affects the snowpiercer theory
I can see why this has such a huge dislike ratio and has already flopped It the unrealistic forced casting of minorities and their forced inclusion in every single scene Us western natives are tired of this constant attack on our culture and our people Movies like adverts are leftist weapons used to normalize and brainwash the populace into accepting globalism the end goal of the elites who control leftists
Why
From the flute to the Oompa Loompa I guess this is a prequel to the 1971 film Timothy is giving some Gene Wilder vibes
No no no its called Wiily Wonka and the Chocolate FACTORY not Willy Wonka and the Chocolate sigh never mind
Corporate greed at its finest
To the tribute of Gene Wilder 
I always like to watch such movie really movie watching feeling
""
Remake wonka again Run out of idea
"Why

You realize the first movie only exists because someone came up with an original idea right Dahl wasnt trying to recapture the nostalgia of the movie that was going to be made  he just wrote a story Maybe you should try it sometime"
Is this the origin story
Wheres the bit from the book where he smuggles the oompa loompas in shipping containers and makes them work for chocolate
Jhonny depp  was 
The problem here is some people find his performance is cringe Anything else The set looks amazing tho
Pinky promise art heist baby reference
Mr bean awww
Whats next Pirates of the Caribbean is the latest installment in the scifithriller genre Im looking forward to
Before Wonka opens a factory he was making chocolate
This movie tells the story of how Willy Wonka becomes a chocolatetier
looks EXACTLY like daniel thrasher
Even the little girl is chocolate
Looks amazing Just a heads up I was just curious I find WBs ethics lacking so I cannot give you my money I really wanted to see this
Im so excited
Looks like NBA youngboy
Hollywood needs original ideas
Hugh Grant God forbid movie studios give little people opportunities for employment
Who be wonkan thier willy
Remakes remakes remakesCome witness the death of imagination originality and good writing
142 is that mr bean  shouting run away
Im crying already and its just the trailer
i want to see to this soonnnnn
This Christmas get Wonked
Just stop No one will come close to Gene Wilder
Very bad
Looks like this one goes to the fudge room
Barf Looks atrocious
021
020
I have to say I like that kid though
Nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope nope
thanks for the preview now i know i dont wanna watch this its like that smelly thing floating in your toilet
I think they are deleting any negative comments
I dont know I kinda wish they would just leave stuff alone now
"Chocolate Cartel Are they throwing their families in vats of acid How has he gone venturing around the world for 7 years hes barely looking 25

I feel bad that this movie was made"
I prefer my chocolate with lots of SPICE hold the sand in it LOL
just go watch rik mayall reading georges marvelous medicine youll enjoy it much more
I love that all comments love something about that and I cant say if theyre ironic or not
"And so it begins
The Wonkaverse "
So you telling me Wonka could figure out flying chocolate but not Fizzy Lifting drinks And no thats not my only problem here 
"026 some body come get her she dancing like a
Edit and 148"
great another nostalgia bait
So maybe this is a prequel Cuz the whole reason Wonka chose an heir was to replace him cuz he realized he was aging but hes pretty young here
Did i just spot Mr bean in the trailer
Cant have a new movie without a little black girl and scenes depicting the church in a negative way Probably written by a rabbi Pass
Looks promising even Hugh Grant is here
The lead actor thinks he can be Johnny Depp but little does he know that there has been and will be only one Johnny Depp in the cinema industry
Please have the some In a World of Your Imagination even if it is just in the end credits that is like the Willy Wonka song and it would fit this movie so well
There is a problem this one follows the 70s adaptation as a prequel wasnt the 2005  the better adaptation Wasnt the 70s the reason why there was no adaptation for so long This feels like an insult to the man who wrote the book by bringing up the 70s film he hated so much
Charlie and the chocolate factory was better
Stop making origin stories of existing franchises
Rowan will always possess Mr Bean in him
Rowan will always possess Mr Bean in him
Charlie Bucket was suppose to be Black Glad they added a Black child this time
"the story of the god of chocolate











Willuis Wonkala"
033 honestly chocolate  corporations act like cartels anyway so this is realistic when you think about it
Remakes and reimagined films used to be rare now its the norm  original films are rare
From the Director of Paddington  You dont have to say more Iam in
Pass
Hope they give the oompa a potty mouth now that would be pretty funny but they too chicken to make an oompa fierce 
Willy Wonka and his terrible purpose
New Wonka Chapter 
I need the crazy johnny depp Wonka
I see mrbean and im amazed
The producer of harry potter
Maybe a prequel on willy wonkas backstory
Wonking time
This wont touch Gene Wilders version of Wonka
Call me old but Depps wonka is the best
I love it when they make these kind of origin stories
219
I AM SO EXICTED
AGAIN
So bad His voice is not it the acting is not it
Id prefer it animated
Im waiting for reviews til I watch this
I miss Gene Wilder
Is that Paterson Joseph from Peep show Jesus
Looks like the pie shop in Pushing daisies
I hope the chocolate is being made with certified cocoa under rainforest alliance
Depp was a failure as Wonka and it was still a great movie I am looking forward to seeing this on the Imax in the Spring of 2023 BRING IT
they couldve found a batter actor for wonka
England is looking verydiverse
 oohh more bland brainless and uninspired rehashed classics  But i thought that was Disneys job Lineup sheep 
Ahh Miss you Johnny
Wonka kid is no Johnny Deep
Manifesting
Timothee
Another one
"You coulda done the great glass elevator and been super original
But you picked THIS

Meh"
Not feeling it
They cant seem to leave classics alone
Looks bad sorry No to TC for this one
I have a feeling people are gonna watch this along with The Color Purple instead of WBs own Aquaman 2
this looks like a big flop and willy wonka acted by some kid with no acting skill jesus
Good actors but Ill probably skip this version
does this tie in with any of the previous movies
cringe
Not sure what the point is of this remake Johnny Depp surpassed Gene Wilder but this is pure aimed at hitting diversity targetsnothing more
I dont feel that he is weird enough for some reason I havent watched any movie with this actor before and I have grown up watching the Johnny Depp version which I loved as a child I really hope it turn out to be a good movie
Noo way the new willy Wonka after decades
Muaddib Muaddib Muaddib 
Looks dreadful
Willy Wonka is just Saw with kids I hope this is R
Another JUST STOP
mrbeanRun away
Paul Atreides dreams about his time on heaven world of Caladan while eating dust on Arrakis
I bet this movie will be release in 3D
Cant wait for this to get review bombed because of the glaring elephant in the room Charlie is a little white boy not a little black girl Just another example of how to fck it up brought to you by Hollywood 
"Oh WOW A remake movie that has no correlation to original story and goes route of  The main guy takes minority hire companion his side to fight EVIL capitalists OMG how original this never done before last 10 years over and over and over and over again totally not 

Hollywood become STOP Sign that where you see everywhere exact same thing except because it is in other side of the road they think they made something new no thanks"
"Ill watch the movie just for one man  MR BEAN 
Love From India "
I winced watching this Grew up on Wilders version thought Depps wasnt good and from the looks of this it doesnt look good either How about bringing us new stories Hollywood instead of rummaging through your drawers to resell old stories in ever lessenjoyable ways
Looks like something that has the same color as chocolate
Johny Depp in heart 
Worried bout direction of this movie
Timothy failed the role
i can smell crimson rivers edits already
 walt Disneyland again 
Another stupid movie yawnnnn
The guy at 030 is Arther Slugworth
   What
Movies always have to be rewritten now so that is Blackified Asianified or Latinofied NEEEXXT
Who keeps giving Timothy lead roles Hes weakkk
Hes a fanstastic actor but I am surprised they chose Timothee Chalamet to play Willy Wonka I thought the would select someone older like a Hugh Grant or Robert Downey Jr
I would rather eat at Arbys then go see this
Creep
After he invented chocolate that gives him immortality He become a Atreides and rule Arakis
Yikes
"Man cant wait to see Willy Wonka  and that kid get trapped in some room and escape and almost drown in chocolate

Definitely a reason why to watch that movie"
Based on real events I got fat due to chocolate
If only wonka was johny deep
msmojo sent me
This looks like fun
Oh thank god For a minute there I thought we werent going to suffer our diversity quota
diabet man
It is widely believed that Gene Wilders performance as Willy Wonka in the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film was exceptional and set a high standard that seems impossible to surpass While Johnny Depps portrayal in the 2005 remake was a commendable effort it failed to match Wilders performance The prospects of the upcoming remake appear unpromising but only time will reveal its true potential
something doesnt feel right about timothy playing willy wonka but i wont judge until i watch it
"You know what would be a great idea People would dress up in brown bring lots of chocolate and eat it whole watching the movie

Or dress up as Oompa Loompas

Similar to the Minions 2 trend"
Just thinking about that time Janelle Monae cosplayed as Wonka
Where is rowan atkinson
"I still use Gene Wilders Wonka line of strike that reverse it

It made me sad that it turned into scratch that"
Johnny Depp wouldve been perfect
i like the old one better
Gene Wilder is tripping over a cane in his Grave right now
      
Ahhh 30 million views on a movie that hasnt been released yet spoiler super 
How many times do you think you should remake the same movie
So where is white Charlie We only see a black girl Or does blacks thinks its ok to replace white with blacks in another movie You replaced white Peter Pan with a black Peter Pan You replaced a white April Oneal with a black April ONeal why does blacks thinks its ok replace white actors with black actors
For some reason I thought he was Daniel Thrasher
Why does he have no facial expressions
He doesnt seem right for the role Ever since Katya said that Timothe Chalamet playing Willy Wonka is just Alyssa Edwards I cant get it out of my head XD
This is just amazing I wonder if theyll show us how he had the mind of attempting to kill children
Are they deleting the negative comments
I knew it would be a charming film when he said wonk two will wonkers for a will wonker of a wonk time
wonka such a silly devious mischevious dubious name
Forced nostalgia childish jokes inauthentic plotyep defiently adding this to my watch list
I love Depp version but this not look bad
"Why are they redoing this again
Yuck"
204
Wonka More Like Wonky
this looks awful
shame
Chocolate Girl
Yo its Daniel Thrasher Cant believe hes in a movie now
This is based on a true story right
A very long candy ad just in time for Christmas
"terrible Gene Wilder impression
Scratch that reverse it D
I just threw up in my mouth"
this is NOT an insane man like the past two
Um no
I cant tell if this is a reboot or a prequel to Charlie
ITS COMING ON MY BRITHDAY
Come with me you will see in a world of pure imagination
Timothy as Wonka  nah Like his work but hes not witty enough imo They needed to find a true oddball
Paddington cast
Why is he ALWAYS American
ROWAN ATKINSON
This is a much watch i need to see the oompa loompa dance
timothee chalamet is as whimsical as batman
i want rekha shankars jilly jonka on the big screen
Oo I see whats going on  Theyre gonna merge it with the Harry Potter universe
So theres no Charlie bucket and etc
Another film ruined by the George Floyd incident and white peoples derangement for equity
Plonker
This is gonna flop harder than the Depp one because it least that one was WEIRD
Nope nopenopenopeGene Wilder is Willy WonkaI love Johnny Depp but he suckedi like Chalamet but some things should stay sacred
I hope this age of hollywood crashes and burns and some new lads step in These directors are too scared to take a risk so they cannablise great old movies and sanitize it removing anything complex so anyone can understand it at surface level
Casting diarrhea
I just dont get why everything is a subpar remake or prequel nowadays have we just run out of interesting and creative ideas
So quiet up and listen down
Lol the Hugh Grant bit was funny 
I liked the sequel better Snow Piercer
This movie looks terrible they should have made this an original because this actor is terrible at portraying gene wilders Willy wonka
Booo
i think this one stays true to the Gene wilder version
I Cringed I Cried I laughed a total of zero times Truly a breath of fresh air and a Solid 3 out of 10 movie
POR MAS NUEVAS  VERSIONES NUEVAS DE WILLY WONKA Q SE HAGA JAMS SER COMO LA IMPECABLE VERSIN Q LOGR TIM BURTON Y JONHY DEEP
sCrAtCh ThAt
People are so dramatic Im sure it wont be horrible I dont think he was right for this movie because hes a little too normal but ill still watch it and I like how it doesnt have much in common with the first one Original
Hope Gene Wilder Will be so proud of him
Roald Dahl is rolling in his grave
Why are none of the comments about how pissed every dwarf actor is about them not casting dwarves as the oompa loompas Erasing representation by trying to not look ableist really backfired
This is the way to leverage the past great movies Unlike Snow White Looks good Will take my kids to watch this as they love Willy Wonka
Pi can tell this is gonna be a Christmas box office breaker
OMGGGGG IM SOOOO INGSIDED FOR THIS TO COME OUTTT
024 never had insane chocolate Ill take it
rubbish
Bleh   Dosent look good at all
You know youre getting old when theyve made two remakes and you still prefer the first
If Willy wonka had a pussi
Im surprised they didnt make Wonka black 
looks like a solid film although idk abt the canoninity
Another classic ruined
Did we really need a willy wonka origin story
Ironic that this movie is coming out in the same month as Godzilla minusone
NotMyWonka
Oh my God this looks terrible
woof that dude is not willy wonka
Chalamets performance as far as I can tell here comes off as very forced Hes trying too hard to be quirky and eccentric and it feels unnatural
Holy was not expectig such an amazing ensemble I definitely will be watching this
Wheres the part where Willy Wonka ashes a cigarette on the peons sitting a section over from him
What happen to wonkas hair 
I might have to give this one a look I dont think any remake would top the original but it appears for more entertaining than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory which was a true disgraced to the movie
Timothe Chalamet is a very good but onenote actor I get hes the goto lead actor right now in Hollywood but I really dont see him shining in this role
103  is that rowan atkinson OMG
Cant wait to see this Snowpiercer Prequel
I had no idea Mat Baynton was in thissss Horrible Histories nostalgia for life lol
The film we dont need but the one we want more than ever Pretty much in a sense lol
No Just no
Thanks  I hate it
I WANT A WONKA BAR SO BADLY
sad that the girl in the film gets eaten by a Vermicious Knid
 another crackhead movie 
am i the only one that thinks timothee isnt fit to this role his acting feels kinda wooden to me he fits drama roles more
Johnny Depp as Wonka is still the best Wonka
I pray this will be the adaptation to FINALLY reveal the Hornswogglers Snozzwangers and Whangdoodles onscreen
Is it wrong to say I came into this trailer hoping for something more in line with the book like the Charlie movie was and less in line with that less faithful movie from the 60s or so
Grant has come full circle
Who up wonking their willy rn
So this is what Paul Atredes is seeing when tripping on spice on Arrakis
This looks bad hes too young with not enough charm to play this part Just seems like a highschool play version
i got goosebumps
Ive been watch the first movie that played by johnny deep And now i want to watch this movie because there are hugh grant and rowan atkinson too It Might be good movie
But why
Honestly Im just so excited to see the Wonka movies back in the industry
Bro sounds like the Onceler
So all this movie is going to be is a bunch of british people saying CHOCLETE Im out
So its a prequel to both films at once Is that brilliant or crazyor both I dont know what to think 
Okay Ill be honest I did not have high hopes before But now I do This looks like a lot of fun
No matter what will happen in this movie always remember that its not the little girl who gets the factory its Charlie
Why is wonka not a transgender socialist poc This is the current year you know
WHY IS IT CALLED WONKA STUPID NAME WHY DO THEY KEEP SHORTENING THE NAMES OF CLASSIC FILMS ITS CALLED CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IE PADDINTON BEAR  PADDINGTON
they almost compressed the whole movie in the trailer how disappointing who needs excitement and imagination eh
He doesnt fit this role This feels forced haha
It is my younger age and full of dream when 1st time I met Willy Wonkaso when I hear it again of course definitely would see it
141
""
008 best line
looks like Warner Bros is going woke too
""
With great chocolate comes great responsibilities immediately reminded me of that one Larry Boy short
Gonna be honest I dont know about this one boys
Am I the only one who thinks this looks kind of by the numbers and a little cringy from a writing standpoint
Maybe the second trailer will be better
The oompa loopas were originally slaves
Heisenberg
willy wonka
I think hes perfect Its Willy when he was younger Back when all he had to his name was a dream and a thousand people trying to crush said dream This was before his magical factory and worldrenowned candy
Is this a prequel
Wilder is was and always will be the best Wonka ever
Originality is dead and we killed it
nope lets walk it back theres 0 charm to this movie
"Timmy being one of the best actors in the industry and fucing Kylie Jenner 

Boy is living the dream"
Timothy doesnt feel the right casting for wonka
What the
I cried when we found out his black friend wasnt even a real girl but an artificial one made of chocolate 
looks meh
Why they always can add a black into any narrativethats amazing right
Wonka movie is about the childhood and teen hood years of willy wonka
Looks terrible but Ill watch it anyway Ive been wrong before I hope Im wrong again I LOVE the original NEVER plan to see JD play Wonka I really like this cast
He looks like one of the kids visiting the factory not Willy Wonka
I wonder why no one touches the Jetsons
ah yes the iconic black girl from willy wonka what
""
Ugg Could be worse though Imagine if Tim Burton remade it with Johnny Depp as Wonka  that would be fu  wait he what
I love johnny
Cringe
esperando wonka
"Cant wait like if you agree



9102023 158p"
This is dishonest filmmaking
Kaaash there is jhonydeep in wonka charactor
I cant wait
Ding ding ding
"
"
"Cringe
Also lmaoing at making Oompa Loompas into cgi shrunk down healthy people so as to not offend midgets even though casting real midgets gives them jobs thus supporting them"
mga totoong anghel yun bat nawala
nawawala phillipines sa smurf pinaliwanag nila na nawawala yung philippines sa listahan ni santa gawa nang naaksidente
I prefer johnny depp before as Wonka
"Disastrous
ESG cancer"
House Atreides will finally have a chocolate factory after all
That lks fun
Dude this fake his dad does not have beard fakeeeeeeee and also Willy wonky do not be friends with one child one child i sayyyyy 
nope scratch that reverse it
Oooo No
I just found out the original character of Charlie Bucket was written as black by Roald Dahl Wheres all the outraged comments underneath all the other remakes
why did they make this
He is damn cute
Seeing Rowan Atkinson running  screaming is the only reason I will be watching this film 
ITS BACK ITS FINALLY BACK
Loganberry 
Glad to hear that this movie will not follow the original book written in 1964 where the Oompa Loompas were enslaved Africans
More WOKE BS
waiting 
Is this the same warner bros making the harry potter series
Learn many recipes including CHOCOLATE
Oooooh Im so excited THANKS WARNER BROS
Katya refering Alyssa Edward when Wonka say  I making chocolate of course  
visually chalamet works but his voice its just not working bro needs more sarcasm and a tinge of weirdness
I am actually very excited to see thishonestly at first I had no clue how Timothy would bebut it looks great The reason I say that about him is just because a huge part of his character in film for me is how I portrayed him from Call Me by Your Name actors are a glorious phenomenatruly 
How can I unsee Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
This looks and feels souless
Something is just off about wonkas dialogue and delivery Gonna predict that the Depo version will still be the best Willy Wonka
Did they seriously have to add black characters in a Victorian setting
""
they sad timothy chalamet sounds like alyssa edwards in this and i cant unhear it
ding ding ding
Bruh favorite line is So quiet up and listen down Nope Stratch that Reverse it
Noo
Realy after two great
im making chocolate of course as alyssa edwards
I love how all the comments are positive I cant wait to not watch this movie 
wait a second this looks decent
I love Willy Wonka but the thing Im most excited about in this movie is watching Rowan Atkinson Ive missed him in movies I dont know why these days hes not in that much movies
casting is a mess 
This looks awful
Imma go on my bday idc what these peeps say its not goin To be bad you can not predict you havent seen it Btw try the new wonka magic hat gummies they are bussin
Who up wonkin they willy rn
Im not hating on timothe chalamet being Willy Wonka but could you imagine Jeremy Allen White being the young Gene Wilder
comments are def being deleted lmao this looks maaad cringe
this looks like doo doo garbage
Blueberry girls should run because im going golfing
For multiple reasons the main one being that I just cannot see Timothe Chalamet pulling off Willy Wonkas crazed lunatic vibe I dont see this being a good movie but man I really hope it is
Wonka  needs to be someone a little more silly with an askew personality
Couldnt even get Strike that Reverse it right
"I feel like Im in the twilight zone 

All of the comments I can seeare overwhelmingly positive and Im over here thinking I would rather get an enema than have to sit through this movie "
This movie looks horrendous
Not him saying Im making chocolate of course like Alyssa Edwards 
I love all these 100 original and not shamelessly rehashed movies being put out these days
They be deleting negative comments huh
This looks horrible 
I cannot wait wait WAIT to see this prequel movie Im getting really excited and watching the trailer all the time
017 alyssa edwards
Can they not stop ruining classics or start making new ones Hollywood sucks
Love Wonka and Tim but something seems off about his performance
WE DONT NEED IT  please STOP 
I dont know about all of this
he looks 13 years old but ok
I loved it when willy added spice melang to chocolate and became the kwitsatzwonker one of the moment in movie history
Im making chocolate ofc Alyssa Edwards  ty to Katya for pointing this out
You all need to stop praising this We dont need them putting this back in theatres after we escape its tendrils
This looks like fookin shite
This actually seems brilliant like truly it feels like it has heart and sole
please dont
Lol katya brought me here 
I personally will not watch this film to protest how disrespectful this movie is   Hugh grant is does not have dwarfism and if you really think about it this just physical version of what blackface is  Literally no different Shameful so wrong
I really hoped that Douglas Hodge would appear at least as a cameo since he played as Willy Wonka in the awesome Charlie  the Chocolate Factory musical and many other classics but seeing Jim Carter is just as exciting to see considering I grew up with Downton Abbey I may just give this a shot and hope the songs  interactions will be good at least
Chalamet really phoned this one in eh
bruh
Looks absolute shite
We didnt need another Willy Wonka film Johnny Depp already perfected it
Pliss aku nonton ini habis liat video dia sama Kylie jenner ciuman rasanya kek gak Della kenapa harus sama Kylie si napa gak sama yg singgle aja si
"Hugh grant as oompa loompa is not  something  I wanted


 and also not neededugh"
om mwaking chwoclit
whyyyyyyyyy 
"Another movie we didnt know we needed 
 Because we dont need it"
This is gonna be epic
I dont think they casted Willy wonka correctly
If they dont have a cameo of a young grandfather from the original Im walking out
Scratch that reverse it 012
Oh wow If the trailer is any indication this movie is gonna be teeeeeerrible
This looks horrendous
this looks sooooo bad how can they do this to my boy willy Also timmy is a good actor but hes being crucified by these shite roles
This actually looksok Like Im shocked to say this but this looks really whimsical and fun
He does look like a young Gene Wilder
Oh this is unfortunately the cutest thing Ive ever seen
"Katya brought me here
iM mAkInG cHoCoLaTe oF cOuRsE"
future classic in the making
TT this is gonna be great
This looks BAD 
I hope its good
say what you want but this definitely has magic I think he will Honor Gene Wilder not just try to copy him I hope it does well it looks solid
Came here from Trixie and Katya podcast Im making chocolate of course 
Oh so Its like Chocolat but less Roma people and more British people and telling Willy Wonkas origin Weird flex but ok
no absolutely not
im only watching for Rowan fr
That sounded like Alyssa Edwards 
God this looks awful
Timothy sounds like someone else but I cant put my finger on it
I want this twink obliterated
"Timotee shalamaladingdong
the coc I mean the Remakeprequel destroyer 
Dune 
Willy wonka 
Armie Hammers testicles
Whos next 
original movies shaking in their boots "
im sorry but he doesnt fit the role of willie wonka
Lmao this ratio is amazing  Im makin chocolate of course lets see if this movie breaks even
ugh
102 Is that Rowan Atkinson
so this timothe chalome decided to finally cash out
"I am Making chocolate of course
Katya Zamo"
I think this  Film will be Good It would in The Cinmar  itlooksgoodtogo And see this Is the New one Film of Willey wonka Rebekah 
"Warner Brothers youre killing the legacies of so many talented artists with your trash cashgrab biopics and milking of existing franchises
One of the pillars of capitalist dystopia is the industrialization of art Youre the leading culprit right now"
Recast him now
JUST RELEASE ALREADY
if paddington was on its good
"When black willy wonka 

All willy wonka movies have white dudes Representation matters bro"
hold on there is something wrong with this how can they make him a guy
Katya brought me here 
whos here because of Katya hahaha
Alyssa Edwards voice Im makin chahwklet a couRse
"The last part had me  Particularly that specific actor as an oompa lompa 
Just take it as a parody of the original"
ugh No
Chalamet isnt right for the role
006 
There should be penalties in real life on daydreaming  would save so much time
If you came here from Trixie  Katya 017
This was awful
I hope Im wrong but I dont think Im going to like it
Who up wonking their willy
meme lines why
Finaly after all this years
Im so excited to see that movie in Christmas and I think that this one vill would be one of best new Christmas movies in this year 
Why are we making a prequel of the Willy Wonka Ronald Dahl despised The whole reason the family agreed to make Charlie and the Chocolate was to make those wrongs a right 2005s Charlie and the Chocolate is still one of the most welladapted movies from a book
Willy Woka and the Redundant Remake Factory
"Stunning how he delivers lines with almost no pizazz at all 
English actor but putting on American accent to play an ambiguous English American character 
Ahhh and a normal size actor playing a role that was for little people but using cgi to make him small 
There is a lot wrong with this"
WOW NORMALLY I would say this is going to bomb harder that Hiroshima but I said the same thing about the Barbie movie so Im just going to step back and watch the chaos and see whos left standing
This is an abortion of an abomination as all modern rehashings are
willy Wonka the orgin story
how many times is hollywood gonna tell the same story stoppppp
This young prat is supposed to compete with Gene Wilder Sorry but no
Shoulda cast MGK or something instead woulda been 10x less cringe
i always wondered how he trapped the oompa loompa race and forced them into slavery gonna be a great movie
wonk
051 A double ha 
Im gonna see this
Was Rowan Atkinson the priest
probably gonna go see this movie because its on my birthday looks cool me like
I wonder if the creator of this movie has Aspergers Syndrome 
no thank you
I feel like Something is missing I dont know Ill watch the movie but I dont feel the hype I did when I watched say the trailer for Barbie
He looks like timothy shalome x tubbo
Tim Tim really out here Wonkamaxxing
I have mixed emotions about this film on one hand its great to see the backstory behind Willy Wonka and how he made the best Chocolate factory in the world also  shows us a little bit more on how he met the Oompa Loompas but on the other hand this just feels like a forced CashGrab
Who up wonking they willy rn
Next jd
i am so excited for thisss the trailer gives me a christmas vibe
When Wonka said Its Willy Time I felt that deep inside 
Trash
I thought wonka was supposed to be middle aged
This movie is gonna be very very good 
The casting is amazing except for hugh grant as the oopma loompa they shouldve gotten a rounder actor by which I mean round face and the cgi is just too weird 208
TIMOTHY IS PLAYING WILLY WONKA
Well my friends it looks like were about to be in a world of our imagination
Can i please see some damn garland Why release it in December if its not Christmas themed
i absolutely love timothee chalamet  hes a great actor and hes definitely gaining a lot of traction these days hes very attractive talented humble and shy yet charming i love watching all his roles and watching his acting career grow i do hope he wins some awards and gets the recognition he deserves for all of his versatile roles 
Chocolate cartel
One of the movies of all time
I cant wait for him to say its wonking time and he will wonk all over the place
American Hollywood fans try not to hype up cringe challenge impossible
Jus watched the whole movie
How many times are they going to remake this movie Arent there any new stories or ideas
i want to scratch and reverse timothee chalamets acting career
Wooohoooo Matt Baynton made it into the big Hollywood productions 
Rowan Atkinson is as magical as Wonka
This is hot garbage
ROWAN ATKINSON IS BACK how much are they paying him lol he rarely does cameos Also think hed make a better wonka that timothy hes just way to young
After I saw Rowan Atkinson running away and screaming I cant wait to see it I already like the cast
I can see theres MrBean inside the movie He said Run away
something we didnt know we needed
THE MODERN PREQUEL LOOKS LIKE WILLY WOKEA  THE CRINGE FACTORY BECAUSE THE ACTOR WHO PLAYED OOMPA LOOMPA WAS AN OUTRAGEOUS INSULT TO THE DWARFISM ACTORS FOR NOT HAVING APPEARED IN THIS FILM BUT THE 1971 PARAMOUNT PICTURES CULT CLASSIC FILM CALLED WILLY WONKA  THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS THE BEST LOL 
This is the most hot garbage movie trailer Ive seen
isnt wonka meant to be a villian
"Whos still watching this 3 weeks later




Dont you hate it when someone asks this stupid question on virtually any popular video no matter how old it is And dont you hate it even more when they hit the enter key just enough to make you click Read more only to discover that the secret punchline sucks Unlike myself its the attentionchallenged moron who typically does this"
Yikes
This will be the greatest Warner Bros movie of all time
I hate how William Wonka makes chocolate
Okay hear me out Paul King is a master of his craft and the cast includes some major consistent talent This could be really good
Alan Johnson
One problem about this trailer already showed the entire movie
Love wonka and timothee has a good look for the casting but his delivery of the lines just seems cringey and forced Well see how the final product turns out
This one trailer gave me diabetes Im not complaining
The black member of the Chocolate Cartel is Sluggworth
As soon as I saw Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant are in this movie I added it to my watch list This is gonna be awesome 
This looks terrible and embarssing
"So glad this is coming out at xmas

Something about this feels like it embodies the same magic felt during xmas season"
Old wiley Wonka factory movie I love it 
      
The main character ruins it for me
I wonder if WB pays for all of these positive bot comments or if these are genuine NPCs
ENOUGH ALREADY Come up with something new for once you parasites
This should have been a Johnny Depp role Johnny will eternally be the iconic Willy Wonka
The origin story of a maniacal murderer This looks to be the spiritual successor to Joker
Too many remakes and very few originals
Who up wonking they willy rn
Its nice to see the OG Oompa Loompa design being used in this movie ngl
I like how theyre supporting dwarf actors by blacklisting dwarf actors
102 bean
"To everyone who say this is a remake
no this is a prequel to the 1971s willy wonka"
This looks horrible Idc Jonny depps version was badd too
Looks like a satiated cringe mess Its going to ingore all the dypopian messaging and go wow wacky billionaire is so cool and wacky no problems here 
NahIm good
a wonka for the kids
I love how Timothee plays wonka
I humbly request that you stop resurrecting good properties only to destroy them
202
why
Errrrr no thanks
"Scratch that reverse it
I winced  That is not the line  That  Is  Not  The  Liiine

Also whos this Little Orphan Annie chick  She wasnt part of the original stories"
I am so ready to Willy my Wonka
T H I S  N E W S  I S  TOO  BIG
God loves you and he wants to save everyone but in order for him to do that you need to repent and be baptized 
God loves you and he wants to save everyone 
That was really woke To woke for me
So quiet up and listen down Nope scratch that reverse it The best line ever
No thank you
Really again
the trailer feels so magical
Why does he sound like Scott Disick
Nah the main actor dont fit in the role 
Wonka in this one sounds more like Jim Carey than Johnny Depp But judging by the Oompa Loompa spelling errors this is an original to the prequel Strike that Reverse it Sounds fun anyway
hmmm he doesnt seem to have the crazy vibe that gene wilder and johnny depp  he seems like a regular guy
Butwhy
I love it  I feel like Im getting greatest showman vibes
So far so good Lets hope they dont do another politically correct  woke remake
108 Mr Moseby what are you doing here 
Diversity in 1800s fantasy strikes again
The comments are really not what I thought theyd be Timothee seems really off in this role dude is great but he just cant do whimsical and eccentric its hard not to see the acting here
This is gud but Johnny depp in this role
I want this movie to be good but we all know deep down it wont be  miss gene
Rowen akninson featured
Wait is that Mr Bean 
I never knew oompa loompa could breathe without oxygen
This is the first time roald dahl had three movies of the same characters in a book
another soulless cash grab 
Looks terrible Weak lead actor
Prediction before watching All on screen white characters will not be ashkenazi Jews this time but Sephardic Jews as the former are too white for Hollywood Everyone else will be transformed into a black female character even though there were no blacks in England at that time It will be a weak attempt at recapturing the magic whilst using corny one liners from the original as fan service whilst somehow trying to sledge straights whites males and capitalism Edit 100 nailed it Every Single Time TheNoticing
I wish I was the part 
Its really amazing I always wanna know Willie Wonka create the chocolate factory
ah yes who could forget all the black people with normal and respectable jobs living in 1800s england a time where even irish and scotish people that look exactly like the english by the way where not even considered white and were also considered less than human
I am actually excited for this movie
They are running out of ideas
This looks phenomenal
looks pretty good
what
Anyone who disrespects this concept lives a wonderfully boring life of reaction videos and useless factoids
This is a prequel so its allowed to be cringe
Hes not enough of a weirdo like Johnny Depp
Jeremy Allen White should be wonka
Johnny is Real Wonka
Judging by all the forced  characters they shouldve called it willy woka lol
This feels like it was supposed to be released in 2013
Hugh grant needs to retire hes creepy and old
Will be a trash movie
This dork is the latest Hollywood plant theyre trying to force feed us now
Mrbean In Is Movie He in 141
White privilege
Here we go Mama gets each Mama going 100
wait so this is a remake and retelling of the book because whatever happened to that black girl
I expect this will be horrid Chalamet is an atrocious actor He ruined Dune and now they are disemboweling another classic Apparently Zegler wasnt available so they got a talentless beta boy instead The modern entertainment industry needs to end
No Johnny Depp massive L no thank you
They should kept the name  WOKE WONKA  rather then  WILLY WONKA 
Hes no Gene Wilder but Im sure hell be just fine
bro is that keegan michael key lmfao
I love how people dont care one bit that Roald Dahl would have so many problems with this from the tone to the tale Those things you will love he would have hated
I dont know when well get the next trailer but I bet PAW Patrol The Mighty Movie would be a good place to show it Dont you think I mean I bet the next trailer will showcase one of the songs or some songs sung in the background What do you think would happen in the next trailer
As a Kid growing up w Willy Wonka and Chocolate factory this looks like its gonna be good
bruh hollywood getting desperate when they making a wonka origins story wth is this trash
you made him bad
at least its not another remake
Wonkas got a chocolate girlfriend
Nobody asked for this nobody wanted this
Still wondering who asked for this
"I love how theyre trying to paint the Timthe hbeaubt as a race ally of some little black girl instead of collecting thousands of native amazonians white people in redskin paint and paying them in Cocoa Beans 
They didnt even redesign the natives they just made them british "
133 that is some bad cgi
Why does he randomly have a southern accent
The quote is Strike that reverse it If youre going make a prequel to a beloved movie at least watch the original before you vomit up the script
Thirty million views less than half a million likes and practically nothing but positive comments sure bro
thanks I hate it
Too many black faces in 19 century clothes Funny
M NOT WATCHING THIS TRASH  JOHNNY DEPP VERSION WAS WAAAY AMAZING AND BETTER 
And those little guys with the orange skin and green hair is the dad
wait is willy wonka the little boy
i saw the mom from padington
BRO ITS SO COOL THAT IS FROM THE PADINGTON CREATERS
Cant wait to see how they write out the little black girl from Wonkas life to explain why we never heard of her later XD
just watch the old one
I already hate Timothee Chalamets performance in this movie based off of this trailer alone
I feel like the only one who thinks this looks good
NOOOOOO WHAT AN ERROR GUYS John Mulaney had come out rehab and it may sound like  ajoke but you KNOW he would have been the perfect Willy
This casting aint it
Wonka is a pedophile Change my mind
m so excited for this movie 
lookin good
Looks like more memberberry slop
This is already an abomination Gene would never approve of this
seems lika a nice movie to smoke a blunt
This trailer remembers me  Charle and the chocolate factory
Too many black folks in this film will not be watching  feels too woke
cringe
cringe
Its crazy how all the top comments are positive when all the recent ones arent This movie looks horrible and misguided Timmothy should definitely stick to typecasting
What a great idea to use her as a ingredient
Why is this necessary This movie will hopefully bomb
Chalmet is really underacting
Looks ok but the sure are pushing the diversity Just hope it doesnt look forced
RUN AWAAYYYY
"So in the last 10 years weve gotten a new movie of or based on
Esio Trot
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Matilda
The BFG
The Witches

And Fantastic Mr Fox is still pretty fresh in everyones mind 
Think well get another new movie based on one thats been made before or will we get one that hasnt been made before
Theres still
The Giraffe the Belly and Me
The Twits
The Magic Finger

havent been adapted yet
Or will we get a new version of
James and the Giant Peach
or 
Danny The Champion of the world  though Wes Andersons Fantastic Mr Fox had a nice reference to it"
"I like how this feels more like a prequel to the Gene Wilder version and NOT the horrible Johnny Depp version

I dont care if the Depp version is closer to the book I read the book and I dont care It just wasnt as good"
Not really what I was expecting looks ok
Why though  Just so we can have a little black girl be the main character instead of a little white boy  Is that literally the only reason for this existing  This doesnt look anywhere near as fantastical and nobody is going to outdo Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp
this looks awful
Ding ding ding ding
i see what people mean when they say charlames wonka isnt psyhotic enough it doesnt feel like the same character as Wilders or depps
Ridiculous
Just an overblown vehicle to give a group of ageing UK actors a hefty pay cheque And as for Timothe Chalamet hes no Johnny Depp A piece of wood
I wonked all over the screen  wonkforwonka
The adventures of Willy Atradies and Paul Wonka
Rowan Atkinson screaming run awayyyy is too good too
Nailed the Oompa Loompa terrible dancing right there hope the movie does not devote so much time on them dancinglike in the last movie
So This is the Gene Wilder Prequel yes  Why was nobody talking about the trailer for a month I thought it was still in production
"Tim Chalamet is getting alot of parts in films recently 
The kid isnt a bad actorbut why is hollywood just handing him all the good roles lol"
Hugh Grant dancing never thought i would say best Oompa lumpa dance ever
Harry Potter vibes some back story a new face that isnt awkward like Im sorry to say Johnny Depp
This looks really bad
Ronald Dahl was Robert Maxwell Ghislaines father He also created Pergamon Press one of the largest textbook publishers in the world He was also a British spy
Not a fan of Chalamet but it looks amazing
I was hoping it was going to be less Harry Potter and a bit more kinda darker in tone like Dune but with Wonka elements
Ridiculous Cinema will never be the same again
Did i just see Mr bean in the trailer 
Why is it so hard to maintain the originality of the movies
Who else saw Timmothee chalamet and was like okay must watch
Who is this child
041 What do they have against daydreaming
im excited for this movie but i was really hoping it would be a horror movie where he is a killer either way timothee chalamet is gonna kill it
This is fing dumb and lazy asf There was already a reboot and even though it wasnt as good as Gene Wilders portrayal it was at least unique This rendition is pure garbage on every level Too many plot holes theres no funny characters and the casting choices are friggin terrible Another classic bites the dust Why would Wonka act like and dress like the older version of himself while he is still a kid Where is the development People flying The original was WAAAAY more grounded then this nonsense
This looks like a cross between Fantastic Beasts and Hop They really are never gonna get tired of pushing out remakesspinoffsprologues instead of creating actual original content huh
i wont ever understand why a dwarf actor isnt  being cast as an Oompa Loompa seriously why not
By far the best Willy Wonka reimagination  And book detail recreation
Lame Timothy is relevant but hes certainly not as timeless as Gene Or nearly as interesting as Johnny And this trailer reflects that by showing us mediocre acting chops paired with tired mr magorium style antics except not as visually exciting Also let us remember that originally oompa loompas are tiny black pygmie slaves that were kidnapped from the deepest and darkest part of the African jungle Fun
Timothee hits different in our hearts
Why wasnt Willy Wonka recasted as a black woman for modern audiences Is Hollywood tired of losing money
""
I have never seen any actor acting as bad as Chalamet here Maximum cringe
he went on to kill 5 children
lol this just looks bad
Im definitely going to the movies for this 
Horrible acting from Timothee Chalamet that was cringe surprisingly
Looks pants
Johnny Depp is a very good willy wonka too
I wanted to tell WB Legendary studios and new line cinema that if they could appear in space Godzilla destroya gamera king cesar the son of Godzilla which was said and appeared in godzilla vs kong and the monsters of Godzilla films in Godzilla and kong the new empire complementing the series for Apple TV and that they appear in the style of Godzilla the king of the monsters and if they plan to make welcome to derry they should make it arrive in October being a month of terror it is a perfect moment making Michael mijers Fredy Gruger Jason Vorges they know each other because remember they were originally connected and they believe the iron giant 2 because this is one of their memorable films and with a good script they could make a sequel that is up to the task raising a lot of money for this
Im not sure how to feel about this If feel Wonka is the type of character your not suppose to know about I feel it ruins the magic if we know his back stories
mmmm I think Ive seen some spoilers Id rather have not seen but maybe Ill forget em
If this guy isnt extremely sassy like the last movie I will cry
Trash
More likeWOEKA
153 THAT TRAILER SOUNDTRACK THO
"I didnt know they were doing a Willy Wonka movie this year just saw the trailer looks amazing

But is that supposed to be Willy Wonka or the mad hatter bc in the tophat outfit he looks like mad hatter 

PS idk Timothees exact age but he looks so young hes forever gonna be a pretty boy"
010 so funny
Is it too late to recast and reshoot like Back to the Future
Its an origin story
I like origin stories
Feel like this prequel is for the Gene Wilder version
Meh
Even more stops pulled out than the other movies and thats just the way we want it
I love how most of these comments feel AI generated
I feel like Richard Ayoade would have made a good Wonka
This looks fun I cant wait to see it
goes the girl doesnt live
I love him but he is not right for this role
WONKA
For the love of god make a NEW movie already
so what im getting here is that clive durham and elio perlman are in a movie together
Rewrite his books with PC language that goes against the themes of the story then create needless backstories that bear no ressemblance whatsover to the original character or world even if you hate Roald Dahl you dont have to try so hard hes already dead
Im getting a bit of a the world is grey and sad outside the world in my head is much nicer vibe from this young Willy Wonka
Mr Bean
Filming took place in Warner Bros
Filming took place in Warner Bros Studios Leavesden in Watford as well as Lyme Regis Bath St Albans and at the Rivoli Ballroom in Crofton Park London
STOP RUINING MY MOVIESSSS AHHHH
i miss Johnny Depp
Johhy always Next Level 
Its not enough that Roald Dahls novel Willy Wonka  has been neutered and woken Now we have to translate that outrage into cinema
MrBeast couldve been a good Willy Wonka after he made his video Jimmy Wonka
How creative A third remake
"Is he gonna do it with the cacao too

"
Not sure why everyone hated his acting he did phenomenal
How is the little girl following him around relevant to the story Genuinely curious I dont know but just based on this trailer it looks very forced and unnecessary
Why
So apparently people are mad because Hugh Grant is playing a dwarf character But then literally a while ago people were also mad at Hollywood for casting dwarf actors for dwarf roles What do they want
Is this a whole new Willy or is this supposed to be either the original or the Jonny depth Willy wonka but just younger
Piroca
Waste time waste money rebooting a movie again  You cant compete with the original  Try to come up with some more original ideas and leave the classics alone  Learn from someone else who made this mistake too many times Disney
I will definitely wanna see that
The writing has the quality of a Disney channel show
Feel sorry for kids that get this rubbish instead of the greats They think this is good 
Gene Wilder Actual little ppl
Better advertisement   Merry Ol Englandnow with BLACK PEOPLE
another reason Im waiting for Christmas
The only reason Ill watch this is for Timothe Chalament 
I found Rowan in this movie but his screen time is very less
reminds me of tartaria
Goodbye Hollywood
"Oompa Loompa doompity doo
Lets hope this movie doesnt disappoint you"
And in 10 years theyll remake it and call it Willy
130  that CGI falling chocolate looks garbage
is the black girl Wonkas personal slave
diversity hires diversity hires everywhere 
Chalamet could play one of the kids who goes to the factory but not Wonka
I dont understand why people are so critical over the excitement of others I LOVE Willy wonka it was one of my favorite films to grow up with and to see that Wonka gets a full close look into his origin completely warms my heart Its exciting and to those who have any and everything bad to say about it can promptly leave everyone else alone You can have your opinion but dont use it to bring people down
Youve got to have some kind of arrogance to think you could even come close to being as good as Gene Wilder Johnny Depp could not do it and neither will you
how is a Wonka movie being made and Jeremy Allen White is not cast as Wonka howww how
the  old oompa loompa reference is funny
nooope JD was better
Stunning the like to dislike ratio here and that so many have given a thumbs down
This is getting surreal now Hollywood has been taken over by the bean counters who realize that they can make more money by just regurgitating the same movies over and over and over and over and over and when that fails just Change the lead to a black actor and PRESTO free press and more 
The pinky promise IS the most solemn vow there is ngl
its wonking time
so quiet up and listen down nope scratch that reverse it
When I heard about the new Willy Wonka trailer I thought it was gonna be about the Glass Elevator book
WOW
""
"Magic black Check

Strategically placed black Check

Blacks in a time and place where they never existed Check

Director feels no need to ostentatiously sprinkle Asians or Hispanics throughout the movie Check

Its all so tiresome

 Hollywood culturally appropriate all things white yet they openly hate us 

Youll never see them make a movie about all the crime waves going on that we see videos of Pure propaganda"
"I went to the theatres yesterday and when the premiere started I saw the dune part 2 trailer and then winks after coincidence I dont know but it was funny

Also this is amazing I swear when I go in theatres to watch this I am definitely going to cry just a fact"
150 that woman is from Charlie and the choclate factory Charlies mom what if this is Charlie grown up
143 Hitler also had a dream yes
"IS THAT HITLER WTF  030 thats hilarious

Willy Wonka Wow just Wow"
He really is becoming a young johnny depp first it was the EdgarEdward Scissorhands commercial now Wonka Looking forward for the new pirates in a few years xD
More trash cant wait
I love how its not just a copy I think this will be good 
here we go mama
Taehyung would be a great Willy Wonka
The part where Rowan Atkinson  Mr Bean is shouting Run away 
I dont know why people be hating
"Is it too much to ask that Hollywood come up with something NEW
Gene Wilder IS Wonka NOBODY WILL EVER DO IT BETTER STOP TRYING

Make an ORIGINAL STORY"
im just here because of rowan atkinson
Oh no they made Willy Wonka hot 
Nah thats not Willy Wonka thats Floop from spy kids
I love wonkas facial expressions that might bring more character for a young willy wonka
I wonder if this movie is gonna explain his twisted sadistic personality and his distaste for children
O o m p a l o o m p a is back
pov you wanna watch this because of timothee chalamet 
Timothee Chalamet as Wonka I mean even Harry Stiles makes more sense
GET READY FOR ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE CENTURY BECAUSE I JUST SAW ROWAN ATKINSON
I mean I guess the next gen will like it but Should have just given us a remake of the Movie first but this is just worrying They didnt pick ANY of the energetic kids to be him
So theyre really going with the dark origin of Wanka huh
"Ok Fickelgruber I can hear and link to the German written on his window thats probably a German name But ProdnoseI cant link that to Italian 
I cant tell if theyre genuinely German and Italian background if not born or if theyre just adding Italian and German to their products name to make it sound fancier"
Will it top the initial one though 
The title is so generic Its like when they called the new Peter Pan movie just Pan So forgettable
Why not just use real dwarves instead of making a tall man appear to be a dwarf Woke Hollyweird at it again
ok wonky willy timmy
""
God this looks terrible Some blend of a film and a television ad
WTF
I dont know why people are hating this
Finally they bringing magic back to the big screens 
102  mr bean
Wonka wont be same without Jonny Depp 
Please let there be no agendas in this movie Looks great in this trailer
"Kid dies

Oompa Loompa 218"
Im actually excited for this movie Must be because its not Disney
Matthew Baynton might this movies saving grace
No
Think in the scene with the flamingos and the running giraffe were going to bring in the discussion of whether or not zoos are cruel to animals a lot have gotten better most I dont think were that considerate of animals back in the early 1900s  from what I remember Roald Dahl did bring the subject of cruelty to animals into his books or at least made most of his villains cruel to animals ie the Gregg family with their love of hunting in The Magic Finger Bruno Jenkins burning ants in The Witches the movies made him a lot nicer than he was in the book and of course theres the treatment of the birds and the monkeys in The Twits Of course theres an exception to that being Fantastic Mr Fox half way theres Boggins Bunce and Beanss persecution of Mr Fox and all the other animals on the hill but theres also the wild animals eating chickens ducks geese and turkeys
104 COOCHIE CHOCOLATE
I actually love the idea of the moviebut timothee chalamet seems so calm  Wonka is just such an expressive character and the actors acting just doesnt really fit the character In all fairness this is just the trailer so maybe the film itself will be better and showing more variety in his acting
"Mean while in the congo
     "
this looks awful
Im so excited for this movie
Why even try Wilders role has no equal Hollywood simply cant help itself
Hes clearly paying homage to the Johnny Depp Wonka but its clear that the film is based on the Gene Wilder Wonka
I was hoping for loads of forced diversity I wasnt disappointed Thank you Hollywood
I through put all my soul
I like i want to fly like you
I like i want to fly like you
Still think it shoulda been Jeremy Allen white
I dont want the naughty kids in this film
Im so excited
 
Ohh I was like its giving Harry Potter vibes and then it shows it has the same producer omg
YES iM READY
Bro just get mister beast insted 
willy wonka origin story yay
I have High Hopes for this Movie and I hope it doesnt F up like Flash
Im so ready for this movie
I dont think Ive ever been so annoyed by a trailers opening line
see disney this is how you do spin offs and remakes
how dare u Depp is the captain Wonka
This is the kind of movie that I live for 
should have had Jeff Goldblum instead he could have made it all about Chaos
Why not hire Johnny Depp for this role makes way more sense and he would have done a amazing job for sure
Jhonny Wonka Depp will be the best 
at 141 u can see Mr bean running from a giraffe
not my wonka
didnt expect mr bean
Ive never been less interesting in a movie from its trailer
""
Why not give the people who write exciting new scripts a chance Instead of remaking Willy Wonka for the THIRD time
A pinky process is for retards omg so childish
Im excited with this movie than hunger games or snow white I think this movie is gonna be fun
I will shake your structure alone where will you be with the choice of how to recognize that you obey my own rule where you will try to remain by your own rules it will be funny to see how the higher elite will be dependent on how you like this I will teach you how to have boundaries to me and know in what power am I
Im available im wily wokar 2 
I have grown so much in scale and with abilities I am so good  that your coronovirus will destroy me all over the world where I have grown  I am alone in scale  through those whom I love its not worth waging a war against me its fraught for you  yes you are petty waging your war to me through those whom I love  where you directly lead me and see that power of me with that return to you 
   
without Johnny Depp this is a small movie  this little one  couldnt play an outstanding role like Johnny Depp played For Disney you owe me the role of our Johnny for me  Johnny Dep is always an impressive and stunning role to play Johnny Depp himself can be played by Johnny Depp himself 
without Johnny Depa this is a small movie 
The Oompa Loompas look even more scuffed than how they did in the 70s
Im so excited for this
This guy kinda looks like Daniel Thrasher
Another classic utterly spoilt by the Hollywood woke brigade I think the title Willy Diversity would be much more suitable
Another one Wow I loved the other ones I am hyped for sure
oh i can tell im gonna love this
On the one hand it looks whimsical and lovely for a Christmas movie On the other and I might be the cheese that stands alone I feel like Chalamet is not weird enough for the role  his lines fall flat to me I love Chalamet so hoping the movie will change my mind Ill watch if only for Grant as a oompa loompa what genius casting
It feels more like a broadway play than a movie
i thought it was daniel thrasher lol
Willy gives me more sexual predator vibes in this not evil chocolate king pin
001 the heist
Disappointed that the Oompa Loompas arent Indian like last time
Sorry but this looks bad way to chessy way to over the top yeah not for me
Poor Flamingos
Oh no Not another renake
Why does this movie look so lame 
i think willy wonkas weirdness was the most important feature that made him special
Change wonka actor he lookssounds too amateur for such a sophisticated and mysterious lead Similar to Daniel Radcliffe  ColeDylan Sprouses career after their title spotlight concluded
"It looks visually well done
but then again so did Depps portrayal"
Is that Daniel Thrasher
"Why make a 3rd one
Well whatever even if this is good the other two are the golden ones shining more than those tickets"
Cant wait
Nothing original is ever produced just multi ethnic remakes
The movie wil be successful Timothee is great as Willy Wonka
find another flame hot as me
Thimothe is the best wonka
What fun Something to make one laugh  just what we need
Who is this for Why
gaaaarbage
It has The series of unfortunate events written all over it but Im here for that
More race swapping dreck
Tom Holland wanted this role so bad
"I love how they pulled lots of storyline content from the classic gene wilder film Even the main character has resemblance of a young wilder
Look forward to seeing it"
"Director of Paddington 
The Christmas feel 
The cast 

This is going to be a brilliant magical Xmas film 100 this year I can tell"
Why does Wonka need to be done again Im so sick of these remakes
"Oh I miss Gene Wilder I loved all his films I think he was actua slightly nuts which is what made him the perfect wonka same with Johnny Depp  I feel like you need to be a little nuts to play Willy Wonka  it seems like we will have three great wonkas to be fair   cant wait 

Can you think of any other people that would have or would make a good wonka For me Robin Williams would have made a great Wonka"
This one doesnt match the tone that much
This looks absolutely awful
I Want to Watch it 
Where can we watch this
Why cant Hollywood come up with anything original anymore Serious question
This movie mostly seems like a strenuous exercise in Mandatory Diversity Casting until the last 10 seconds when it introduces the extremely white Hugh Grant as an OompaLoompa And Hugh is hilarious
hot take but i think chalamet is cardboard personified so this has me nervous lol hope its good though
Ive seen a lot of these actors i feel like this will be a great movie
I hate where he is whispering in darkness
No thanks
Starring the two Academy Award losers of 2018
Its good but depp could make better
Why not Johnny Depp
I dont know why everyone is hating on it because Timothee is wonka It looks so good
Timothee Chalamet is everywhere
Its wonka time
Timothe Chalamet is perfect for a willy Wonka roll
A cast of most of my favourite actors
First word that came to mind to describe this movie is Lovely
Im scared
Another remake  What an unexpected treat  Wake me up in a few years and I might get excited
I loved when he said OMPAASASSEMBLE
043 he made a chocolate person
"Another reboot

There needs to be one where Willy Wonka would be played by Weird Al Yankovic I wonder what that would be like

Also one of the tests should be like the three course dinner gum but instead it would be a COVID vaccine"
Ticking the diversity boxes I see
Another remake from a creatively bankrupt industry
From Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp to Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka Its like a whole new generation
Not the write actor pick Not enough charisma or madness in his eyes 
Its not canon
Wow Timothee was a huge miscast from the role its like hes forcing himself to act eccentric
Charlie and the chocolate factory 
141 Rowan Mr Bean Atkinson said the line from Monty Python
Paul after Arrakis
Random black girl with wonka You devils dont sleep with the brainwashing
Heres my question why are the oompa loompas getting even smaller like in every film
Remember Dwarfs are  not allowed to play dwarf roles anymore because its demeaning soo lets edit a person to make them look like a little person woohoo   how is the left not crying abo8t this
"Christ As IF we needed a remake of this
Let alone another movie with THIS guy

Mark me within four years there will be multiple sequels"
141  MR BEAN
No one asked for this 
FROM THE DIRECTORS OF PADDINGTON IM OUT 
Ok but hear me out How about we make some original storys for once instead of just remaking movies and shows over and over again
Umm didnt Jonny   nvm
It looks like it will be a good film but I also like the mystery behind Willy Wonka so I probably wont watch it But it does look like it would be something Id enjoy watching
010
When he says with great chocolate comes great responsibility gave me chillbumps
No Charlie bucket
I may be going crazy but is that Matthew Baynyon 135
I hope it is diverse enough
Whimsical
too late ive started dancing now 
Harley idol
Honestly Im most curious about Chalamets musical and dancing abilities  The trailer has a magical atmosphere suitable for a Christmas movie so I hope the movie does well
Nah what if people with wands just show up bc harry potter producers
Never understood why they dont use English actors to play english parts
Why does Willy Wonka look like Daniel Thrasher
Its good to see a tralier where is just about how he started and not how he is bitter or way to happy and is taking kids around and making their dreams come true
This looks absolutely without a doubt atrocious
What a missed opportunity to feature Jeremy Allen White as Wonka instead 
Its really nice to see a different way Wonka gets to his success and I like it already I actually wanna go see this in theaters now The Victorian Era honestly gives it a different charm and I like it something new  fresh too
Can not wait for comeback of timmy
Why am I all of the sudden very hyped for this movie
My My the journey of delicious chocolate will began again 
I think at some point Dahl had a job as a chocolate taster I just know he had a lifelong love of it
thumbs up for doin something original and not a remake  
017 shes nicks mom in heartstopper
A film I wont be watching
Timothe Chalamet needed a flop anyway
010
They could have chosen somebody other than Timothee This role absolutely was not made for him
This genuinely looks good I think a Chocolate Cartel is very in character for Rhal Dall and his books I think this will be a great movie
But in order to make this a masterpiece Warner bros have to fire David zasher  sorry dont remember
I think Johnny Depp was the greatest when he was in the movie Charlie and the chocolate factory
Cant wait for this to turn out like meatcanyons wonka
Did this is the backstory of Willy Wonka then I will watch this because there are three movies and this is not enough to Johnny depp film
This look terrible
040 WHY DAYDREAMING WHEN THERES A LAW
First there was the original and then the first remake which was terrible and this remake which makes the terrible one look good   great    
So is meant to be a young gene wilder willy wonka
I cant wait but I dont think it will be as good as the OG
I love TC and really want this movie to be good but the forced quirkiness is giving me cringe I dont think I could sit through more than 30 minutes of it
There was the classic never to be matched original  And then there was theEast German SM dungeon club one with Johnny Depp  Now we have the Hogwarts one
How many Willy wonka movies do we need 
Why
Terrible acting terrible story telling 100x worse than Johnny depps version and a million times  worse than wilders
Chalamet performance seems very flat m
lmao the industry knows how nostalgiapilled this generation is
the og ompalompa is back
"December 23  Van de makers Paddington en Harry Potter 
Leuke avond slaapwel deze nacht "
"Grunka Lunka dunkatey doo

We got another TimCham movie for you"
Whos here after travis dissed Timothee and Kylie on utopia
Use it for Dislike
Im so excited for this movie I grew up with Charlie and the chocolate factory movies I love it so much the acting perfection
No Daydreaming
Who are these writers This is dreadful You have to be kidding me Im sorry but you should be sentenced to 3 to 5 years in federal prison 
Ew Timothy chalamet sucks
Im in  love with Chalamet but him trying to do a quirky character is mad cringe 
141 was that mr bean
Who up wonking they willy
This is basically the 1900s and 2000s WW combined together
I just dont feel like this guy has the same charm as gene wilder did in the 70s
timthy charmand sock de wonka for de golden tiket xddddddd
This looks worthy of one of those family movies I could show my kid and they could say they saw this as a kid AND the original  one
Willy wonka doesnt matter to you
seeing timothe chalamet mr bean and keegan michael key in the same film is something i wouldve never imagined to happen
OK THE OMPA LOMPA IS TOO COOL
Wonka is back
looks garbage  ngl
Timotheee So excited
Cringe
oh I get it were in an era where classic movies that may have already been remade will now get remade AGAIN so black people can be in it Fun
I LOVE TIMOTHEE CHALEMETS ACTING IN THIS SO SO MUCH MAN ITS FRFR GIVING WILLY WONKA I LOVE THIS CANT WAIT TO WATCH IT FR PLS
Anybody who watched 009 and says that theyre sold on this guy as Wonka is an absolute fool
I dont get excited about many movies but this looks awesome
wonka siempre ser johnny deep cagada total de esta peli
timothjee sucks so bad
I love how they took elements from both movie adaptations and turned it into a complete package I got emotional hearing a cinematic remake of Pure Imagination the Oompa Loompas look just like in the Gene Wilder movie and they managed to keep that wonderful magical vibe of the Johnny Depp movie
Ive had this idea for years
Timothe Chalamet be like Nope scratch that reverse it
Wow
You know Im something of a wonka myself
Rowan best part of the trailer rest looks meh
At first i was like was that rowan atkison then as it played i heard him say run away i was like nevermind its mr bean
Oh I am DEFIITELY seeing this one
"Woah such a diverse cast
Theyre definitely going for the Oscars this year"
Please make a Chuck movie Chuck fans are waiting for a movie
Im glad they made a new one the Jonny Depp one was unwatchable  AWFUL
The trailer is so heartwarming I teared up when at 202 wonka spelled out in chocolate Goodol childhood
Im actually excited about this  I grew up with the original ones with Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp 
The old Wonka movies is not enough
Im actually intrigued I will see this
Were I can see it 
WBCU Willy Wonka vs MCU Tom Holland Spiderman who wins battleground takes place in Wonka Town 100 yrds apart
This is already TWO THUMBS DOWN 
MMRRRR BEEEAAAANNN
ES NICOES NICO
They keep trying to make Timothee Chalamet happen but he doesnt have the movie star magic There are a thousand of him
Garbage
"will these studio stop unnecessary casting of black actors eg that child actor Cast some one who is perfect for the role I have scene the Johnny Depp version and Its clearly killing that vibe Another can be said as Diseny for changing cast and storyline of fairy tales eg mermaid or barbi at the end of the time These are doing nothing but destroying what is in real extremly precious I live alone and have great loving parents and they provided me everything to grow on my own and so I did but this growth came with a price that these people dont understand

so I hope people will turn towards philosophy once again and instead of destroying original stuffs for no reason at all theyll start celebrating it"
Zero interest in this It couldnt look more bland
creo firmemente que timothe har un buen trabajo el es un gran actor nos lo ha demostrado muchas veces
Weird casting choice for Willy Wonka  I dont like it
He has his place but Timothee Chalamet is not Willy Wonka
I see a lot of people hate on this and yeah its another reboot but this looks genuinely lovely
is this a prequal to the other movie
I swear all original ideas are from the late 1960 to earlier 2000s and after 2010 the glorified remake era Youre telling me no can come up with something original Meh
omg 102
im sorry but that shoulda been a brit
"Timothy Chalamet plays a desert messiahwarrior on a hostile desert planet

Also Timothee Chalamet plays Willy Wonkas  successor"
kind of cringe but looks ok
We already have TWO versions of the Willy Wonka story do we really need another
this is about the cannabis industry lol
This movie looks dumb and boring
It makes me hummm  I will have to see it before I can say yeay or neah but so far nobody has succeeded it reproducing willy wonka That compares to the video gene wilder did
Why so young
Just one simple question  why
Mm GOOD 
This actually looks like a fun movie Would be a great change of pace from a lot of movies weve been getting this year
Once we started we cant stop 
Alot of people are bashing on it but this isnt necessarily a remake its a prequel of sorts willy wonkas backstory and i dont rly follow timothee i think hes doing good so far a few bits here and there were it didnt quite fir but id watch it
This dude is the Harry Potter of chocolate
This looks terrible
Ok yall love him but having someone attempt to be Wonka after Dep is just Ill just say this you have to be ready for a role like this and you have to have the capabilities to be animated It looks ok alone but when I compare it I dont want to really watch it
Timoothe is having 2 movies this year dune and Wonka
This looks like a nightmare Just stop
"Because we can all use a little Wonka in our lives every now and then  Also a little Timmy too
"
So quiet up
If this film doesnt have any female blueberry or other fruitrelated inflation in it then no deal
This looks awful
This looks magical 
Anyone else watched the early version
i need to tell my sister this shes a hardcore fan of the willy wonka franchise OO
Kid playing wonka Is dead
I hate Oompa Loompas with a passion but now Im just confused I like Hugh Grant but want to throw his character into a meat grinder
Sorry but the guy playing Willy Wonka has zero strangeness and weirdness that Wonka needs Im gutted I was looking forward to this
I DONT THINK SO   PEOPLE 
Im proud of Timmy
Why didnt they hire true ommpa loompa
Meh to happy go lucky its like making a Friday the thirteenth movie but taking away Jason and just having a bunch of people with borderline personalities living on a camp plus the whole thing is gonna end up tied to the harry potter universe which is annoying
 
December is too far off to see this
I love when i get spoiled the entire film from a trailer
Wonka Potter  Pass
The dude playing wonka reminds me of Daniel Thrasher and that is hillarious
how did I know Charlie was going to be a black girl with afro hair 
Its so funny when see rowan atkinson running
141 MrBean with the cameo
i love this budding genre of taking a member of the main cast of a movie who isnt always the main character and giving them an origin movie titled said characters last name
Who thought Chalamet was a good actor
I love wonka hes the best Im excited for this to come out
"I love when Wonka says
Its wonking time"
producers of harry potter im in
 Wonka     
How in 1800s back people are treated so nicely
142 Mr Bean casually chilling in the script
Ive never seen so many black people in a 1920sera centralEuropean townmustve been part of a post WW1 programme
Im pretty sure Im going to hate it  usually remakes are fairly decent Well with all the woke nonsense Youre asking to be kicked in the balls
its actually strike that reverse it
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has heart This trailer is a fail on that
Gene Wilder had charisma Timothy Chalamet is a more of a brooder so its difficult to see him as Wonka
Why isnt Jeremy Allen White cast in this I feel cheated
They should have left it at Johnny Depp honestly
sera un hran jhonny deep algun dia
hugh hrant mi amor de todos los teimpos
el here go mama llore
omgggg sere la primera en verla
la ultima escena wowowwowoow
esto luce magico
mr bean gran actor feliz de verlo otraver
amo a timothe ser un gran wonka
011 hands down the most cringe part
MONKEY SEE MONKEY DO  90 of the comments are AI bots from some marketing company I guess they think most people plan their purchases by reading anonymous opinions Probably works and is dirt cheap to implement
I feel like I could have played Wonka better
racias timmyy
muy humilde
me encanta desde ue salio en call me by your name
jhonny deep es abusivo ue bueno ue eligieron ptro actor
tomothy debio aver sido napoleom
muy guapooo
muy buenos axtores pero de que tratara
parece musical
mr bean im a fan
timmy looks better
estoy aburridaaaa
no se si ver esta pelicula
timothee se parece a aidan gallagher
mexicoooo presente
quien de aki habla espaol
timothee es el wonka perfectp
el trailer luce decente pero no la bere en el cine
papacito
papacotopp
timmy es mejor actor que tom holland
el mejor wonka
lo amo
me encanto
Cant wait for him to say   Its wonking time and then wonk all over the screen
Luv the brief glimpse of Hugh Grant with Wonka  Im thinking more positively but theres a very high bar that I doubt will be eclipsed
Willy wanka
Willy Wonka is belong to cap jack sparrow I swear 
Hollyweird out of ideas for 15 ffkkg years  If it wasnt for comics theyd be bankrupt
AHHHHHHH THIS IS SOOOO GOOOOOODDDD
"What do you get when you guzzle down sweets
Eating as much as an elephant eats 
Who can you blame for your terrible shame

Terrible performance from the main actor Couldnt they have found another Jewish actor who could at least act like Johnny Depp 
Mix the letters in santa s a t a n
Ew
"Just been to see the current UK theatre tour and its spin on the original film and enjoyed it
Enjoyed the trailer but its going to spoil the magic of the original film"
Pls no more remakes
""
GET AN ORIGINAL IDEA
its gonna be a great december
This comes on my mothers 37th birthday
I really REALLY hope this is good still waiting on the sequel to charlie and the chocolate factory 
Yeahhhhhhhhhhhhh no
Timothee Chalamet really has me crushing on Willy Wonka Hes quite the character
Finally After all the dreck from Disney  Co this movie actually looks like a fun film that hopefully families will want to watch teens adults and even old people like me can really enjoy some theater magic again Hope it lives up to the trailers hype
this looks interesting Ill be waiting for this one to come out
give us the press tour for this film pleek
Looks Promising
Amazing I wanna see this
Too much magic not enough science
Timothee seems like a miscast imo 
I kinda dont like the way they turned him into a Mary Poppins type character
Running out of movies to make
This is gonna be an awesome movie
Im go watch it not because I actually like whimsy but just for a fact that the Oompa Loompa looks exactly like an Oompa Loompa should look not like miniature Mexican
If I see Mr bean Im warching
IM SORRY BUT WHY IS THIS GETTING CLOWNED ONN Its kinda good its a childrens movie so what its a lil cringey its not as bad as some other movies Ive seen
Got a feeling that this film is gonna underperform BIG TIME
Going to be honest with an unpopular opinion This movie sounds pretty cringe Not in the Johny Depp as Willy Wonka kind of cringe But in the sort of Overly whimsical nostalgia bait kind of cringe I mean The Chocolate Cartel Really A law against daydreaming Im all for an origin story but this is just a bit much
""
I honestly thought that this was going to be a dark gritty movie with guns
Another classic story ruined by modern times Every single thing about this trailer screams cliche From the name to the actors to the music to the cgi to the bad writing to the costumes to the every god damn thing This is exactly what every 2020s movietrailer is Its terrible and you just know this will get about a 6 on IMDB with people left thinking they overappreciated the older movies because of nostaligia while they actually were good and this is bad
I am SO READY for this
where is his dentist father 
REGGIEj
Yeah Im looking forward to this
It looks good More like the movie with Gene Wilder
"I feel like Im not gonna be too afraid of Wonka after this adaptation Ever since I was a child I was horrified of him but Chalamets version seems like he just wanted to make a chocolate factory not a kid murdering money laundering scheme like the last few


Also The ompalompas 
Too late Ive started dancing now Once weve started we cant stop"
Where are you Johnny
Not every story needs an origin I shall call this film Wanka
Else everything is nice but where is my captain jack sparrow johhny depp
Its Poll Atreitas
Wait Rowan ankison
From 0210 completely woke I will skip this movie
Lol I hope the strike goes on forever in the hope future generations are spared
why willy wonka has children around him
Our childhood is upcoming
Bunk
Wow 
Ohh no Just by watching this 2 minute tailer I can tell This is bad really really bad This has like a corky kids tale with a very goofy like script Very very goofy like script Now that I think about it This movie is like that tv show the girl with the pink hair and that annoying bozo guy Whatsss that loony tv show called againnnn ohh yeahhh LAZYTOWN Literally the same genre of film This is really not good Im a huuuge Willy Wonka fan but this movie isnt it The title and vintage movie art had me convinced truly Until Ive seen the actually movie scenes The acting is very forced its obvious the magic is literally handed in this movie Handed like in a effortless goofy way Honestly man they just dont make the movie like they used to UGHH I really do not want to watch this film Im usually 999 right about movies but if its good Ill come back and edit this comment But man its not promising
When I heard the plot I was like thats sick I watch the trailer and now Im sick 
Fantasy magic that doesnt exist beats the corrupt businessmen 
nice I want to see it I love it
Disliked for injecting black character and not good main actor as willy wonka  this going to be a huge flop 
God this looks off This is not a Timothy Chalamet part Its just because hes popular and has the look of Wonka so they decided to go with it Him being all kooky just doesnt match him at all and seems very forced and unnatural
I am sooo excited for this one 
ill wait the story wonka met oompa loompa
Prequel to the Johnny Depps Willy Wonka
"What are you gonna do Willy
Slavery"
Why must they make origin movies for everything
Ik everyone is saying this is going to be the flop of the year but I have a feeling everyone is going to forget they said that when it comes out and they LOVE it Trailers can be misleading lets just wait and see how the actual movie is before criticizing
I hope this movie fails  Looks AWFUL
dawg
Token black of course
A real cocoa tree tree  I guess not
I dont understand why so many people have a problem with Timothees acting I think this trailer is great and I strongly believe he portrays Willy Wonka really well
This looks lame 
If this stays lighthearted but emotional I could give it a chance  Just I pray dont shoehorn in any preachy ideology stuff  It could be great prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  Even using the best Oompa Loompa version
Ralph Fiennes would be an incredible Willy Wonka Why not make a sort of sequel where Wonka transfers ownership to Charlie Make marketing a new fantastical candy a part of the plot Advance the steampunk technology in a way that maybe comments on automation in factories Itd be something seemingly more special than the cash grab attempt at what if BEFORE blank
You need to release this at the same time as some other thematically opposite movie for meme marketing
Priest Bean
This is more canon to the original willy Wonka than Johnny Depps performance of the character
So sad that the Ompa Lompas arent midgets anymore CGI Hugh Grant looks lame
Woke Willy wonka
     
Ooh this is gonna be good
Use me as a dislike button
So quiet up and listen down 
This actually sucks couldnt have made a worse casting for Wonka
"So youre the owner of the chocolate factory thats a good thing use it
Because all my visions lead to horror
Because you lose control of the chocolate factory
Because I gain it"
timothy would be a disaster for this role
The Greatest Showman meets Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Looks promising
Rowan Atkinsons in this
bts
Ruined it
Im so excited to see this movie Timothee Chalamet is perfect for young Willy Wonka
"Even if this wasnt tired hackneyed boring bollocks the same as everything else thats come out recently I never wanted to know more about Willy Wonka than I already do
You reveal too much you ruin the mystery You ruin the mystery you ruin the magic"
 release on December 15th
Movies now in a nutshell
Oof this gave me secondhand embarrassment
This is the 4rth chocolate factory movie how many are there coming 500
130 who is she is guys
We missed Johnny Depp 
Why cant movie directors come up with their own movies instead of recreating movies This is horrible
NO
Another one for 5 dollar bin at Walmart
RIP Gene Wilder
thanks for this trailer so I can know in advance that its another trash movie with typical mandatory diversity agenda Tim Burtons looks much better
And this is the same guy who had got raw dogged by some dude in another movie
what a disgrace this new age of film is RUINING GREAT STORIES apologize to johnny depp now for this warner bros
no thank you
CANT WAIT FOR THIS 
YAY
oooooooh love that Timmothy Chalametsuch talent and so schmart
Oh look another remake of a movie that they continue to beat into submission Does anyone have a new idea anymore
Looks like its going to be as bad as Johnny depps
its giving Robert downey jr Dolittleand we know how that went
Looks pretty baaaaaaaad
I hope the wonka bars come out to promote the movie
Not feeling this trailer because Timothe is kind of awkward as wonka
And just like that Im in the Christmas Spirit
As someone who grew up with both Wilder and Depps Wonka thinking they were both fantastic in their own right an origin story sounds like nobody wants it but will be interesting
But Willy Wonkas racism is key to his character Also him being apathetic af about ruining everyones lives
Is this a prequel to Johnny or Wilder
This entire trailer all I could think about was the Willy Twonka SNL skit
lead actor is not a successful choice he is not talanted
until someone cheated you i would love to see how wonka ended to be a solo act
Ham fisted attempt at magic by the communist overlord cinema servants because they are failing on so many fronts
Looks insufferable
I am unhappy with the studios creative choices on this featurelength film Please make this better
you can change all their lives you can give them diabetes
OMFG STOP FORCING EVERYONE TO BE BLACK IN THE MOVIE
All im gonna say is keep all the other garbage prequels in mind before swearing this movie is a masterpiece
I think the story is about pedophilia 
102   mr bean  rowin atkinson
Timothy is such a good actor He was able to convey the fact that he was given this role as an offeronly no audition role on screen so well
Im definitely going to watch it
Please oh please be a musical
DOGECON DOGECON DOGECON 
After the terrible Jonny dep version will this be any good
The only reason to see this movie is rowan atkinson
I typed in modern day Willy Wonka expecting some kind of sketch or parody But ofcourse there was a new movie coming out
Looks like a snooze fest
Wondering how many retakes there were every time the phrase Mr Wonka was uttered cos someone mispronounced the surname slightly
Pls if you have a film pls dont make ezra in there
but he is no where near Johnny
Excited for this
no way did they get Rowan Atkinson as the preist
Paddingtons mom was there and here its his mom so does that mean hes paddingt
i LOVE this
You see Im something of a magician inventor and chocolate maker So quiet up and listen down Nope scratch that reverse it 
I cant wait till freaking Christmas I want it now
Absolute Garbage 
I love the part where Timothee said its wonking time Really a movie of many generations and timely accurate depictions
I love the part where Roman Reigns went Acknowledge Me and everyone went wild
But why do the police look German
What will this me on like will it be on Netflix Disney Hulu or what Becuz I love this movie
Came here just to say boooo
Im not sure how to feel about this
Who up wonking their willy
Gene Wilder is rolling over in his grave
Excited about this lol
 keegan michael key as keegan michael key
I always loved the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Ive watched it so many times and it brings so many memories
I cant wait to watch 
Why doesn Hollywood refuse to hire actors with dwarfism to play little characters anymore
This is bringing back all of my early childhood memories Loved the original to death when I was really little I wish Gene Wilder would have been alive to see this RIP 
Who up wonkin their willy rn
Too late Ive starting dancing now 
This kid has it  Ive never seen him in anything before but its obvious he can carry a movie  Cant wait to see the Willy Wonka movie just like Barbie  straight out of my childhood  And Hugh Grant as a grumpy Oompa Loompa perfect casting
This aint it
"Im from old school 
i cant watch this kinda  so cute movies with there so cute heroes my last good watching masterpiece was  back to 2010 with Inception since that I can see the first 18 mnts of any movie then i cancel a big apologies to all the great directors "
St Pedro shoss
Winka dag
Drag winkar
Event Sophie turner Jehnny deff
Imagine theres a post credit scene teasing charlie bucket 
Aight so like this is making me wanna play more Hogwarts for some reason
Im definitely not watching this heap of garbage and I hope it flops
Only problem I have is the Oompa Loompa They needed to hire small people to actually play the part They made Hugh Grant too small
No one can replace the great Gene Wilder but Timothee Chalamet has a certain Boyish Charm that a younger version of the character needs
Love the trailer look forward to it

Man this movie might flop big time
I am so excited for this movie Wonka After watching its first parte and know this Cant wait I think this part is going to be more fascinating and full of discoveries 
Yeah but why make another willy wonka movie tho
If its not Johnny Depp it is not for me
Ill watch it only because of rowan aktison as the priest
This movie seems confused
Naaaaaahhh
Suena mucho mejor en ingles pero me estresa leer espaol con audio en ingles
Chocolate makes you fly XD
awkkkk hurry up and come out already i cant wait any longer
I watched this and now I miss my friend Paalvee
151 thts the mom from paddington
Timothy Chalamet is the next Johnny depp 
Stop with the remakes
"Cant wait this is gonna be amazing any version of charlie and the chocolate factory will be respected forever 
Thank you Roald Dahl for writing such a masterpiece that is now being retold in many different ways
And Timmothe Chalamet is gonna own the role of Willy Wonka 
I have a feeling this is gonna be the best one yet"
Why am I crying after watching this All the best actors even Rowan Atkinson
Woke garbage
I think this will be good It is different than the two previous ones as it should be Johnnys Willy Wonka and Gene Wilders Willy Wonka were not meant to compete I am excited for this one Then we can have three different versions
Fk Yes
pass gonna still prefer old Wonka because hollywood just knows how to f up everything
"Willy Wonka of all people should know that white chocolate isnt chocolate

It contains no cocoa solids"
Wee man wouldve been better if he played as an Oompa Loompa instead
cool but johnny depp 
Is he still filming Dune 2023
Hugh grant is great but I feel that a little person could have had a big role to shine and make a mark in Hollywood
This will never be the original movie
Imagine there being a third willy wonkamovie
The movie where every other character is made of chocolate
WAS THAT MRBEAN
Here we go mama 
This looks gayer than aids
No ITS NOT
Love the part were he said its wonking time
God isnt umpa lumpa supposed to be blue 
Am I the only one who thinks this look terrible Apparently so according to the comments I like a lot of the cast but it does not look good to me at all
unless this was written by Roald Dahl its not really  wonka is it 
What a whos who of acting talent Dear god Id watch this film just for the cast list alone
This looks awful Come up with something original for heavens sake
This movie looks like some dogwater but i not gonna lie the oompa loompa was gold
I hate remakes but this actually looks amazing and hilarious
Amazing 
I only smiled when mr bean showed up
Sweet so were going to find out how he got his hat
i dont like it one bit sorry timmy its giving me fantastic beasts vibes a lot which is not good also why is hugh granr an oompa loompa and not a little person actor
Nooooooooo Why keep doing this over and over Hes no Gene Wilder    If they just hadnt called it Wonka had just let it be a new story I could watch it
However Jonny dep is the best character for wonka 
Aint gonna lie this movie looks fire 
Timothy Chalamat does not look good as Willy Wonka
vltl
I have gotta watch this
if i dont see danny devito as one of the oompa loompas
Few movies are more dependent on the lead actor than Willy Wonka  Gut reaction from this abbreviated trailer is that they missed the mark
Wow Im bored
Willy wonka choclates
Harry potter broom
No
From the Director of Paddington and Producers of Harry Potter geeeez louise I am so excited for this TC as Wonka
Lets keep remaking old movies into woke garbage INSTEAD of new creative and intelligent ideas    We will call itart  Then cry when no one sees it demand more money for actors because they are SO CHEATED then allow them to continue to look down their noses at us and virtue signal to us
Trying so hard to copy Disney 
A black cops in the Victorian era Yes sure 
A charming actor plays a great Willy Wonka who really want to see this movie
041 lol
WHOAAA
024 yall still didnt get the reference lmao
doesnt look as eccentric version from johnny depp
Rewatching this trailer many times just shows how this one just wants to be fun I cant wait
eh
I prefered johnny depp as willy
115 Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of physics
"Do it up colorful once they get to factory  
Looks good so far Willy is great GREAT Christmas  movie to see here"
Boring 
hopefully I dont see an Oompa Loompa
What a flop 
Token is getting a lot of work now a days
I want the movie to be a good movie but I just feel like this movie is gonna flop Like Timothe Chalamet seems like a good actor but hearing his voice it just feels like hes holding it back on something that could be better It sounds a little cringy Like lol it sounds like in the trailer as if he doesnt want to be filming the movie at all
im not watching this sorry
Timthee is low key overrated
I think Paul inhaled too much spice and is hallucinating
Here we go mama
I hope he emotes in this movie
Idk I think Wonka should be an older person to be honest not some young twink who looks like he barely has any experience running a giant chocolate company
yasdssss
Gosh
Can we stop naming movies and series literally just the last name of the main character
real opinions  sort comments by newest
brain dead humourHUH DOUBLE HUH
Race swapping and woke
Wsh cest bleu un wompa loumpa non 
Looks not that good
Wish Johnny Depp could do it
Stop
looks like poo
Um Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa SOLD 
Who saw this trailer with Barbie
No
Johnny Depp is incomparable Psychologically it doesnt sink to me The Willy Wonka in my brain is Johnny The movie looks great though
"Oh no Wonka is white Cancel this movie

Lmao"
"Still should have cast a dwarf as the Ompa Lompa rather than using CGI to mask a tall person as a dwarf
It looks better when you have people fit their roles physically according to the source material
Just wanted to point this out for those not aware of it in this movie"
I must not eat chocolate Chocolate is the mindkiller Chocolate is the littledeath that brings total obliteration I will face my chocolate I will permit it to pass over me and through me And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its path Where the chocolate has gone there will be nothing Only I will remain
They used real pure imagination to make this film
The director could produce manage to make a live action adaptation of food wars minus the animeisms like Booba everywhere
This looks god awful
My dream life 
When did lil mabu become an actor
Cant you people come up with a original idea You just remake the same movies over and over Its boring and pathetic
this looks terrible
I dont think he has the charisma to pull off wonka Sorry lad
im sorry but no one will ever overshadow johnny depps performance as willy wonka bye
Well at least I see a black girl character
Damn come up with Something new
This looks like Harry Potter but without Harry Potter 
Willie wonka and chocolate chip factory
If Wilcox and punchsrelle got to together with Willie wonka chipuwunka
Hehe Timothy charmander hehe
LETS GOOO
LETS GOOO
141 run awaaaay
People complaining that Wonka is overacting when thats literally his personality and how the character is  people can be stupid af sometimes
trailer made the movie look boring asf
Its good Warner brothers aint becoming like Disney and 6 foot tall Oompa Loompas
WAIT why is Wonka not BLACK
Am i crazy or is Timothy not a good actoreverything he does seems forced and plastic its just not good or organic
I feel like it has been long time since last movie that offering full happy dream like this produced
Cool another movie that will be released on my birthday cant wait
Lets just hope theres no windy scenes in this movie Timothe Chalamet should not be in windy movies
It looks so bad
Yeah I think I still only care about the original I dont think that Im so committed to the original that they couldnt put together something that would impress me but this doesnt look like its it
Sooo many fake likes
Why blax
One perfect movie is all that has ever been made from these books That was the 1971 Gene Wilder telling Everything after that just leaves me uninterested This is going to look beautiful and be instantly forgettable just like Tim BurtonJohnny Depp film
Is that Mr Bean
What happened to originality
I heard about the Wonka movie and really hoped that they chose an amazing actor I am so glad its him Hes an amazing actor omg
all i have to say is WHY
Idk hes too ecstatic
"Another Wonka
Bonkers"
"You could change her life Mr Wonka
You could change all their lives
You could give them diabetes"
Oh god this looks terrible
William wonka without johnny depp
This is good for Mr Beasts chocolate brand Feastables for something to promote chocolate
Why it is necessary to have one black person to play the character There is one who is playing the boss Why hollywood is so much with the cultural appropriation
OMG YES 
First go n grab some spice from shaya halud
The producer of Harry Potter  I am in
I can smell the wokeness right through the screen  Pass
This movie is the entire backstory of Mr Wonka before he made his iconic chocolate factory
Jesus loves you
I see Mr bean there
Sounds like Charlie and the Chocolate factory 
Sounds like Charlie and the Chocolate factory 
Sigh Why try to remake something that was already great They will never make a Wily Wonka better than when Gene Wilder did it
Willy seems a little boring if you ask me  Gene had it perfect Depp was creepy and this guy reminds me more of the guy bagging my groceries
Well well well Mr bean is also herethis gonna be a blast 
Why Cant they leave things alone I doubt this would be Dahl approved and they could have used actual small actors and given them a job
Too bad its not Johnny depp
Why is Hugh Grant a 511 actor playing a part a little person should have And why is his head all distorted Is that what they think little people look like
Oompa Loompa are dwarfs cast a dwarf for the role Also Oompa Loompas are not 6in tall
After seeing the trailer even small kid will know the value of Johnny depp no comparison in acting legend for a reason Johnny depp
How did they miss the opportunity to change his signature top hat for a fedora
Wowowowowowoow
HARD PASS
I am so excited about NOT watching this movie
Cant wait to see this in the cinema when it comes out
Finally not a traumatic willy wonky movie
i saw the memes of him sounding like alyssa edwards before watching the trailer and now all i can think about is this
no
Mr bean
Oh A black girlboss sidekick Trailblazing
Oh Another remake Groundbreaking
Who Up Wonking They Willy RN
Cringe
I can tell that kid is trying to imitate Gene Wilder but he cant even come close but all the kids know nothing about Gene Wilder so they0ll watch it
This looks kinda terrible I think the only reason they should bring Willy wonky back is if they want to make it a horror movie
so this is a rip off of what roald dahl created
i think i will stick with the gene wilder version
Doing this movie a third time wont make it any better Gene did such an amzing job the whole cast did they had no bussiness redoing it with Depp And I love Depp in his roles but the Wonka movie with him was horrible This looks even worse than that one And honestly yall that enjoy this got no taste
A great Christmas movie
We need more movies like Joker and Sound of Freedom controversial and not afraid to offend anyone
Ok Im in on it 
No
XD Must black girl xd
012 this is not good
It looks terrible
This is like normal Willy wonka but seeing how he makes the factory and how producer from harry poter and Paddington and mr bean actor here 
Black lead or we riot
Its like one more part of harry porter seriess
im sorry but he doesnt fit the outcast lunatic role well
woke garbage not interested
Wow we got a prequel of Charlie and the chocolate factory
I like my chocolate free
Maybe were just in a cinematic era of everything being a flop but I just strongly anticipate this to be terrible Would be good to be wrong for once
A great tribute to our first Willy wonka Gene Wilder
Truly an incredible movie chalamet is the perfect actor for wonka chalamet face looks like from a fantasy world of disney
Chalamet is indeed a best actor for wonka
Dear Hollywoodwaaaay too soon
No one will ever replace Gene Wilder in this role but still looking forward to this movie
No Just no
Timothe Chocolatemet
pull up in a tonka color of willy wonka
This is gonna bomb Then theyll probably dig out and deage Genes dead corpse What a creative time we live in
"amazing
An origin of Willy Wonka
They didnt show that in Roald Dahls book
 141 Hello Mr Bean
This is going be the greatest Christmas this year"
Im gonna watch it seems amazing
This looks terrible
The world needs this movie
This is cringe af
Another flop movie by Warner Bros Not because of the movie It is because of the cursed of Johnny Depp
"Yeah nah I dont like it 
Completely goes against what Wonka is supposed to be not secretative at all Plus I think TC just doesnt fit Wonka as a character either"
Another lame remake RIP Hollywood
Chalamet should stick to playing moody teenagers  He doesnt have the range for this as an actor  There is suppose to be a menacing quality to the character of Willy Wonka which he completely lacks
""
"It looks good but I wished the director said to him
 Act like a young gene wilder wonka andaction"
Honestly so glad they cast Chalamet rather than Tom Holland Seems like a much better fit to me
So now its Chocolatiers of All Lands Unite you have nothing to lose but your Gumdrop Buttons
Look for see this movie
despite no one asking for a wonka prequel ill still watch this movie
No hate but the way he delivers dialogue is so robotic 
eww no
"Sir Rowan Atkinson

Ok Imma Watch it"
I just cant stand how they wont let Willy Wonka be blonde again
This movie could be dogshit or it could be really fun As much as I love timothee chalamet Im leaning towards dogshit but I hope Im surprised
but the cocoa farmers in africa are still living below poverty line
MR BEAN ON THE MOVIE THATS CRAZY 
Johnny dep wonka sucked and this takes too much inspiration from it  Ugh
i would BRAWL a child for a golden ticket
005013 makes me want to do junko poses and silly cosplay gestures everytime I hear it
Looks horrible
Wonkker
Terrible
This is why Hollywood blows  Make something new please  Knock it off  Make something NEW
Not a patch on Wilder or Depp not enough character for the character
Im loving how fantastical and overthetop this film looks definitely the wonka we need I hope they continue this storyline with the same cast and crew all the way to the charlie story arc I wanna see Timothees take on ominously teaching the kids a lesson
Looks terrible
THank God they shoehorned in black people into early 20th century England Makes perfect sense
Guys I need to get a haircut how short should I get it
Just stop MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL
I dunno at first I thought this would blow but seeing as its done by the team who made Paddington with zero ego Im looking forward to this 
Missing Johnny Depp
I cant see why people are hating on this moive it looks great
Hollywood has run out of new ideas
Im surprised Wonka isnt black in this
Wait a minute Hollywood cast Hugh Grant as a dwarf OompaLoompa   I thought this kind of cisman stuff didnt fly anymore  Hollywood is erasing dwarves now   First Snow White now Wonka 
Cant wait for Wonka The Chockoverse to come into theaters with the addition of Johnny Depp Crispin Freeman and digitized Gene Wilder
this looks dreadful but I guess Im required to watch because of Rowan Atkinson Keegan Michael etc etc
Chalanet is looking ke the poster boy for good content destroyed by culture poisoning WOKE Garbage reinterpretationDunealtho visually awesomegarbagethe ACTUAL Willy WonkaGene Wilder Willy Wonka is the absolute OPPOSITE of woke cultismso instead of giving opportunity to work to actually qualified little Peoplethey insert that pos Hugh Grant
Who here is also experiencing Childhood Nostalgia from watching this
a 2 hour commercial about functional meth users
Willy Woke and the chocolate factory
let me get that wonkussy
Why cant they make films without Nes and Gs 
Ugh Timothy Chalamet is just so wrong for this Think Ill skip seeing it
More WOKE diversity garbage
doesnt look offensive in any way shape or form but do we really need a prequel though and whats with the cgi again its so obvious at least make believable cgi scenes i am guessing they arent confident with this movie doing very well so they arent spending real money to make the thing good
This looks great
Johnson
Wheres Charlie
Charlie and the chocolate factory is the best ever
I Thought The Oompa Loompa Gets A New Design Now With A 1971 Deisign
Like the finest of pralines this movie has the scent and texture of lukewarm diarrhea
"Hollywood is OFFICIALLY dead 
This looks beyond stupid"
Ill pass on this movie
Make new movie ideas and not remakes
I am very excited I much prefer the Gene Wilder version than Johnny Depps version
I love the lack of diversity I dont see any arabs in this film Why dont they put my people in films
zoomer wonka
Im just watching this for Mr Bean
No selfrespectable chocolatier would consider white chocolate chocolate
Cute
Do little people actually get rolls anymore  the cgi in the last poor remake now the little orange singers in this one then the snow is not white and the 7 diversity hires
Again I feel like we just did this
How can people dislike this its wonderful
Would have been better with Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka
This movie looks amazing tbh
"nice more woke trash with fake oompa lumpas 


no thanks pass"
No but thank you
It will succeed
102 141
eddies
Woke garbage 
Kind of reminds me of Perfume The Story of a Murderer but with chocolate
    
""
WB im surprised its not a blm willy wonka
man that music BGM was jest awesome
""
CGI CGI CGI and not a f good idea Another nothing to be forgotten in 1 month
Quit remaking my favorite childhood movies The Johnny Depp remake was trash You cant touch Gene Wilders performance MAKE AN ORIGINAL IDEA FOR ONCE AND QUIT RIPPING OFF CLASSICS
Dumb
looks boring af
""
Ugh  enough already with the remakes 
The original Willy Wonka was Great  loved it Johnny Depp willy Wonka was magical this Wonka is a background story to Willy Wonka Im so stoked for this
When I hear the word chocolate cartel it sounds like a drug operation like the Pablo Escobar kind
Couldve sworn that the end of the world AND sand monsters came close to killing this guy but Idk thats just me 
How do you like it dark white nutty aBsOlUtElY iNsAnE
Chalamet is so overrated Movie looks great but its having him play the main character is a disappointment
OMYGOODNESS I CANT WAIT We need a Backstory
Once we started we cant stop  Huh hahh 
Johnson
this looks fun to watch I cant wait
"The reason the little girl never appears in the books or other movies well lets just say Wonka went to far in testing what could and couldnt be turned into candy 

Strange how hes now looking for new kids with these Golden Tickets  But perhaps Ive said too much"
I dont quite understand how people say this is a remake Its clearly a movie before Charlie  which the other two wonka movies are about anyway color me excited A movie on the glass elevator book next
Rowan Atkinson stealing the show with 2 seconds and one line
Just finished the movie I really like the nuclear detonation scene but the third act skybeam did seem a bit rushed My favorite part by far has to be when he jumped off the chocolate bridge and Willy Wonka said its Wonka Time and then Wonkaed all over the place
Who wanking their willy rn
Nah man I am so unlucky I have my exams at time  this movie is going to be a masterpiece and also Christmas 
Wonka from the director of Paddington  The Mighty Boosh the writer of Paddington 2  the producer of Harry Potter Paddington Fantastic Beasts Gravity Marriage Story Juice Yes Man
I saw mr bean
how did they pull this off legit looks better than the original
this looks so good
"This is awesomeI had no idea about this 
"
Wonka a pedo living with a random black child
Timothee Chalamet is giving very strong Onceler vibes from The Lorax omggg
Sorry I found Johnny deep replica as wonka
Looks good but Timothee chalamet was not the right choice
Timothy challamet amg 
Love the story by Roald Dahl but you just cant improve on the original Willy Wonka movie 1971 with Gene Wilder  its a classic
I think them making Willy Wonka movies multiple times is cool Im very VERY excited for this movie I dont care what people say Im excited and I love how different all 3 movies are from each other and how they play off the books differently Also to anyone reading this go see a Willy Wonka JR play They are amazing and I got the honor of being in one of them It was so fun and so magical and this movie brings me back to being a little kid and watching the original movie with my parents
Warner Bros on fire 
Is this a sequel to the orig Charlie and the chocolate factory
Whos wonkin they willy rn
Willy wonka is such a hard kind of character to pull off without coming across as creepy or cringey Its actually a miracle it worked so well in the first place
Omg I cant wait
Naaaa Wheres the factory
kaget gw tib2 ada kata harry potter ternyata produsernya
Another Wonka movie is like another Joker movie Except you dont like that version of Joker
Hugh Grant has no problem getting acting roles Give the oompaloompa roles to the little people Wtf
Makes the Johnny Depp look like a pro
This looks like an SNL satire
Looks absolute shite
Dope
There can be only one Willy Wonka  RIP Gene Wilder
"What about the lead actor scares me makes me uncomfortable

Hes too much so something or not enough of something else Look at me Im made for camera ewww"
This movie is giving me a lot of Harry Potter Fantastic Beasts vibes
Its wonkorbin time
MR BEAN
this looks corny af Im not seeing it cause im not ruining the first movie 
Im not watching it fam Im perfectly content with the two wonka movies this looks absolutely horrible 
Hes the best man for the role
This Wonka before get success for him chocolate company
This aint it
"I wish someone would film the sequel to Dahls book Charlie and the Chocolate Factory

Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator is actually much funnier but no ones ever filmed it"
You understand how over the top brilliant Johnny Depp was in this role when you see a really good actor like Timothy perform it and not getting even close
This could be very good or another nothing burger that ranges from pissing people off or just being ignored But the daydreaming joke and flying scene give me some hope that it will be a Roald Dahl fantasy humor So not holding my breath but Ill check it out
Hmmm not sure how i feel on this The movie looks fun and seems like a good origin story for the Gene Wilder version of the film but then i very cynical about movie studios rehashing old ideas and lacking any originality which this movie to me on first impression looks like it it will do mostly faithful as an origin storybut again the movie will not be original and a new creation it might just be a skinsuit of nostalgia
SEATED FOR THIS
Sad to see Little ppl r angry hopefully they get over it before the movie comes out
timothy chalamet isnt giving wonka not even a crumb
"Ive watched this trailer about 5 times now At first when I heard about this I was all Meh  But when I saw this for this 1st time my expression IMMEDIATELY changed to  and I got a BIGGEST crush on Timothee ChalametM now 

I am DEFINITELY wantinggoing to see this in theaters SUPER EXCITING "
Do you guys know ehike inly being 13 kf the population a crrtain type is of person is over 50 of roles in new movies Why
Looks frigging terrible Then again itll fit right in with majority of movies made today Hollywood is dying a slow painful death
It looks very boring I dont even want to see the trailer   310
why is the mother look luke paddington mother
Hugh Grant is playing a Oompa Loompa in Wonka
"Why tamper with perfection 

This is not a movie you can remake into a better one so dont bother remaking it"
He cant replace the real wonka
Its been 52 years since the Gene Wilder version and 18 years since the Johnny Depp version
No just no
Wow nice movie
Why
Jhonny depp 
Who wonking up their willy rn
Oh boy I canwait for the remake 2 years from now
Let me guess  black girl will be one of the two main characters equal to WW
looks shite
Im excited
Just came from woke Disneys Brown Snow White and what a refreshing change
They did it again a waaaaay too long trailer that makes me feel like I watched the whole thing not watching the movie anymore
woke ah willy wonka i hope it flops
Its so bad there is no way
gwapo nya
Is willy wonka a magical candy maker
SOMEONE TELL ME WHEN ITS OFFICIAL
Looks terrible
Its gonna be great if Jhonny deep as Wonka
Its gonna be great if Jhonny deep as Wonka
Its gonna be great if Jhonny deep as Wonka
102 Mr bean is actually in the movie yeah im definitely watching it now
What a very 2023 movie
Jhonny depp 
Love it already
"Gene Wilder did this already It was fantastic Wasnt Johnny Depp in one before this one 
Still as usual here comes Hollywood green lighting yet ANOTHER remake unnecessarily 
I dont wish ill will towards all that made this movie But as an audience member no thanks"
Here we go mama
PEAKKK
I think this actually looks great very magical and a new story of a character we love I have a question though does anyone think that Timothee Chalamet is a bit soft spoken for Wonka or is that just me
"From the producers of Harry Potter
Now Im NOT going to watch the movie"
This movie looks kinda wonkey
I like this only because it has a different plot then the other two movies
It seems Wonka has nothing to do with Charlie and the chocolate factory which is not disturbing as the first movie
I cant forget Willy Wonkas character from Johnny Deep
Oh my god this looks awful im so excited
I love how roman aka mr bean is in this movie
ayo is that daniel thrasher jk
Is it just me or does the actor who plays Wonka look kind of like Daniel thrasher
Willy Wonka looks like a normal person maybe he make it more realistic ver of wonka
THIS IS SO BAD EHHH
Cannot wait for this to come out
Was there ever a black character in the original I think NOT
I was afraid this would be horrible but it actually might be kinda alright
MY MAN Rowan Atkinson  1003
Oh brother they sure Love remaking classics just to mess things up
I really hope this is good
Ruined this movie too Stop ruining movies
We dont need another willy wonka movie
Here for mr bean 
no thanks
Ew Gene made it iconic Depp had a believability about himself as Willy Wonka I always thought Timothee is just the it boy in Hollywood that everyone is trying to push and while some are crazy about him this kind of is another example why he is not a good actor It feels like pretend in a high school play type of way All the good and great actors can make you believe they are that character Timothee just looks out of his element entirely Hes more suited for less lines vogue style faces lol and no need to show any emotion This also did not need another movie Hollywood is creatively bankrupt
How far have they fallen casting this kid in a role Wilder made immortal At least Depp had the crazy eyes This kid has nothing
its so funny that warner wont get any promotion from the cast hope the strike lasts well into december
Cant wait to see the blueberry inflation
He looks like hes about to pace the pews in a church corridor
Pov its the year 2030 and we are looking back at this peak trailer
Give me chocolate
Gee what a nice dude Hope he doesnt end up sending children down garbage shoots or up chocolate pipes or stretching them or blowing them up
This movie did not need a sequel
Missing depp
Sinto cheiro de Oscar apesar de Oppenheimer  a frente
This looks so good His exaggerated expressions and movements definitely remind me of Gene and his chaotic Wonka interpretation
Alan johnsons beamer
"I came here bc I heard ppl dont like his acting and I sorta agree if the whole movie is like this its like someone has a gun to his head and telling him to be Willy Wonka Its a guy pretending to be Willy Wonka not Wonka I hope the actual movie is better and his acting is better than what is shown here
EDIT The more Ive watched this trailer the more I like it and have high hopes for it Still worried about it being a kids movie But less worried about Wonka"
I love that this is the Prequil that hasnt been told in depth
why is lil mabu playing willy wonka
Looks fun enough Grant as an oompa is gold lol
Idk this might reek of modern influence and it already is Id be lying if I said Im not worried about this movie but it doesnt look bad by any means
Harry Potter
WHY
Whyyyyyyyy
people are saying that this looks like it sucks but it actually looks quite good
Nice to see that its not just another remake of the classic movie  Looks interesting
Good job Hollywood Another remake due to no creativity for new movies lol
"LG boy another shoveled out unwanted prequel TV show no one asked for for a movie that didnt need one based off a book with a sequel thats much better deserving of an adaptation

Ill pass

Ill pass"
Looks like they hollywooded tf out of this and thats not a compliment
Surprised Willy Wonka isnt black
I loved the part when he said Its wonkain time
barbie oppenheimer now this we are definetely eating good4
What the fish What genetic is the Oompa Loompa
0101 mr Bean is that you
i dont like chalamet in this role hes trying too hard to be johnny depp
I dont see how it could be worse than the Tim Burton version
Sure why not
Theres gonna be a post credit scene about a golden ticket isnt there 
""
I loved the part at the end where he said Roads where we are going Marty we dont need roads
Giving young Gene Wilder Vibes Im here for it 
""
Classic will always be the best
"no daydreaming
3 fine
I would lose so much cash for that"
Noo waayyy
There is something about how he says his lines Stiff unnatural Maybe its because Depp was playful when he said his
I cant wait to do this musical fantasy about life and adventures of willy Wonka because its coming to theatres on December 2023
Im so glad they are finally doing something original in Hollywood
why are all these comments positive this looks like absolute dogshit
Another rehashed movie There seems to be no new ideas in Hollywood
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
I love there are no blacks in the future Willy Wonka turned them all into chocolate
Not the movie we wanted but the one we needed
He was better in Dune they cast the wrong guy for Willy Wonka
this looks so trash what an awful portray of willy wonka why is he so cringe in this movie
That looks like its going to be so good
As usual a great little story trashed by Hollywood
Not exactly my type of movie but I love Timothe so I mean 
Please tell me this is willy wonka in young if not im gonna cry
WILLY WONKA IS BRITISH
This better be heat
Wait is that mr bean
why does the ompa lompaa sounds like brian from family guy
this trailer brings back good memories of the movie charlie and the chocolate factory 
I hope Timothee Chalamet was famous voice of Wonka
I think that Timothe is going to be so good in this movie
Theyve run out of ideas
A movie about enterpreneurship Precisely what we need the most nowadays I love it And it looks awesome too
What is this
Im about to see this this looks great
why
Here we go mamatear
something is missing  I mean I know its gonna be a great movie for some people but for me the previous ones are just too good It had more eccentricity character and depth This will not replace or is better than the previous Willy Wonka movies but Im sure it has its own audience and a different Willy Wonka story With that being said its a pass from me
king henry making chocolates
050 amogus
Ive spent  the past seven7  years traveling  the world  perfecting my craft You  see Im something of a magician  inventor  and chocolate maker so quiet up and listendown  nope scratch that  reverse  it 
I hate it when they add black people in a movie thats suppose to be set in the early 1900s
Pass  The original and Johnny Depp version will still be better
I cant wait to see it
so excited for this
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory already has a remake We dont need the Threequal
This looks so good cant wait to watch it
Probably like most woke trash being produced today they will include many hints and nods and the best nuances inspired from the first movie  Like the flute sound
 Come with me and youll be in a world of pure regurgitation  Creativefree  It lacks imagination
and another cash grab
Woke Willy Wonka
I liked the part where all the bots composed fake approval comments that were artificially stacked at the top of the list
Looks like trash
I cant wait to not see this
there is mr beannnn
to whom he gave his ss to get this role
Timothe Chalamet est un EXCELLENT acteur et DIGNE dendosser le rle que notre Roi  ADOR  avait endoss il y a des annes Je me rjouis daller voir ce film 
textbook overacting and not enough energy to fit the role i cringed after every line he said and am fully expecting this to flop
Why are they making this movie again
OMG ITS THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORES 
Tim is so fing boring to watch and has a monotone low voice   THAT is NOT Willy Wonka
Oh no
WHY IS THIS RATBOY GOT THIS ROLE  OHH HES BEEN FD IN THE A BY HOLLYWEIRD OFFICIALS
directed by the people who made Paddington yes please I also realised that Sally Hawkins is in this movie who played the role of Mrs Mary brown in Paddington awesome
Wonka again
I hope its not a musical ughh
This looks dumb
"How is it not the same when an actor does blackface 
And an actor pretends to be a dwarf There are plenty of dwarf actors who want these roles"
"After watching the trailer I personally think that Timothe maybe wouldve felt more comfortable and as a result his portrayal of a character like Wonka wouldve appear more natural and charming if hed already had experience with playing these type of characters in the past but unfortunately he doesnt so this is pretty new to him and for us to see him like this and maybe thisas a whole combination adds to this dislike that some people has of his performance of this character 
But Im personality waiting to see the whole movie to have a definite opinion on if I actually like him as the new Wonka or not
At least for now the trailer looks great to me"
Wow cool cool cool cool
Absolutely insane and that head twist was perfect it might make this guy actually a good Wonka
Since when did Charlie and the chocolate factory get a black girl with an afro This movie is going to bomb hard with viewers  First why remake Gene Wilders magnificent job of acting in Willy Wonka Cant anyone write a new script This movie is going to bomb at the box office
Wow another movie where they take roles from dwarf actors and give to normal actors
You do realize youre supposed to get better the more times you do something not progressively worse
Thats not the original willy wonka thats Charlie after he inherited the chocolate factory
Is that Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka 00
Hollywood is dead
Ehhhhhgive me Gene Wilder over this mess any day
still not better than jhoony deep
ya quiero verlo
cant wait to hear this story be told once more
No thank you
i wanna see it it looks fun tbh
Please dont be a woke bait and switch Id like to love this film While I miss Deep Roy in the part I have to say Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was the best part of the trailer
019
Another flop I c looks terrible af
timmys kinda eating this up 
This looks good yall tripping 
The Chocolate must flow
Not woke enough
so Disney hates little people I guess they cant even cast them here and instead use hugh friggin grant Im so done with Disney and there ever expanding agendas instead of telling good stories for stories sake a great character should be a fluid thing not a forced down your throat
I Dont see Charlies grandpa here 
the quiet kid he probably gets it
I hope the cinema has got a 32 plasma You get a film up on that baby and you are seriously looking at that movie
I honestly would rather know how Charlie bucket did running the factory after all these years
This trailer looks absolutely awful The guy playing Willy Wonka might be the worst actor Ive ever seen
Im a lot more excited about this movie and FNAF over Barbie and Oppenheimer any day Cant wait to see the Willie Wonka prequel Hopefully itll be good 
Looks god awful
This looks great
This looks amazing cant wait for it to come out
Definitely giving a pass on this Doesnt look good
The house of Atreides has come far
this looks 
Seeing this reminds me of the movie Charlie and the Chocolate Factory that I watched as a child
Timothy looks SPECTACULAR in this More than he did in Dune
Pass There is the original and that is all this movie shouldve never been recreated or retold And I can care less about a prequel
Boooo
This looks very cringe
"Normal people  This movie looks bad because
Conservatives  Wokeness 
Normal people  Uh"
Stupid movie
This looks terrible
I wanna see this just for the pure sillyness of it 
I don get the hate yeah a bunch of parts seem cringy but hopefully thats just because theyre out of the context of the world that theyre setting up in the movie I really liked the paddington movies
he looks like lil mabu
103 Mr BEEEAAAN
WOAH OKAY GOING IN  A LITTLE BIT OF A DIFFERENT DIRECTION WITH THE WHOLE WONKA THING BUT ALRIGHT 
this looks horrendous
Again the magic of Willy Wonka was captured not in special effects but by the brilliance of Gene Wilder  The main actor is weak his voice is not commanding and not inspirational  This is another tawdry example of a beloved story that is once again bastardized for profit
SMH I was like where the umpa lumpas then I was like yessss they are my all time favorite movie characters
No golden ticket whyyyy
Mr Bean   I dont know how I feel about someone being with Willy from the beginningand a child at that
would definitely watch this
At least we still have the Umpa loompas
This is going to be like a prequel to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Ie a story of how Willy Wonka have a chocolate factory
I guess he who controls the spice also controls the sugar controls the universe
So when Hollywood runs out of pre existing movies TV shows and IPs to adapt remake or create sequels and prequels to because most studios largely spent decades ignoring the need to create new content then what
No Depp no Buck
Nostalgia
Timothy Chamalet has the charisma of a concrete wall
This movie comes out the day after my birthday Might treat my self by watching it with my family
Johnny is Johnny nobody can replace him
Anyone else sad that Gene Wilder isnt around to see this 
nobody asked for this
They had me at Paddington
I love the change in the story instead of the classic story we all know its something knew Its sortof a prequel to the second movie as its how Willy started which was talked about near the beginning of that movie They could have done the greatglass elevator as its an actual book like Charlie and the chocolate factory but this is a great new story
idk
Movie looks like trash
Something tells me rowan atkinson applied for the role of Willy wonka and got denied for not being able to franchise the movie He would be the greatest Willy ever
"A beautiful woman is lyke looking a succulent steak No matter how much you eatit it still looks good  no matter how much you itout it still taste good

If you dont see the problem with that then congratulations youre either a woman  or a real heterosexual man 

EverlastingGobstoppersShouldBeASecretServiceReservedExclusivelyForKidsScienceFictionWillyWonkaAndOrTheChocolateFactory"
Another little black orphan movie Hard pass
Some characters do not need a backstory
On the BBC news website someone is complaining that Hugh Grant is cast as an Oompa Loompa but isnt a dwarf I didnt hear anything about no dwarfs being cast in the new Snow White film though how odd Or is it
"Gotta hand it to them its a great strapline
How Willy became WOKER
couch I mean WONKER "
This is just as mid as it gets
Shouldve called it Willy Woker by the looks of it
finally a movie with no love interest
Is that MrBean at 102 
No Johnny Depp Nope for me
"I need a refresher

Is this the Kid in the Will Wonkas chocolate factory and hes all grown up Is this a reboot a prequel or a Sequel or both of either of the 2"
This must end with a mind erasure candy
Its Wonkin time
Wow the Dune sequel is a lot more colorful
Wait No Johhny No Me
Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity
ROWAN ATKINSON LEZZZ GOOOO
"Mr Bean is back 
Woohoooooo
Lets gooooo"
This is dumb
I hope this one wouldnt be so disappointing
snow piercer pls
Cant wait to watch the movie with my family
Nothing to see here Just a small group of people defying gravity I hope the whole movie has me laughing this much
Pinkie promise this movie will be everything i want it to be
Mathew Baynton being cast as the Ficklegruber is not something we wanted but something we needed
""
""
Something tells me this movie is going to be hot garbage
I dont get the bad reviews on this It looks finegood
Why wont they do a movie about the sequel The Glass Elevator
Mr Bean is here
Yeeeyy the story of Mr WONKA
Nice
Bro why did they make winks so fine for
"Im sorry butthis does not look interesting Timothee Chalamet was not a good choice hes overacting in many parts of this and at times just looks psychotic And frankly making a prequel to the classic film was already a terrible idea Prequels just answer questions that no one asked and create many plot holes for the the original movie Take the Oompa Loompa for example Its always been that Willy Wonka had human workers before closing down the factory then later he found the Oompa Loompas and reopened the factory Here he seems to be getting them from the beginning 

This is not going to be a good movie"
NOT THE CHICOLATE CARTELL 
Looks awful
Why is he white
Im sure its woke Time to go broke
Literally a origin story to gene Wilders willy Wonka
141  MRBEAN
Kill me now
Im sorry but this looks like just another cheesy soulless Hollywood franchise cash in with bad CGI Me personally I dont think I need to go watch this
This looks corny af
"Fantastic beast but chocolate 
This looks very cynical and how to make a buck called it all along"
This gave me the chillbumps
Eh Ok
Is he selling chocolate or delta gummies that make you so high you fly
millenial
quiet up and listen down nope scratch that reverse it
Idc what yall say I think this actually looks good
This looks so cute In the mood for the holidays now and its July lol
The colors feel dim
Oh yeah this is gonna be bad
3 Willy wonka
why does it feel like one of those generic 2014 Disney prequel movies
"1971
2005
2013
2023"
"011
Bop it Pull it Twist it"
Okay Timothy as Wonka is 
cringe
Chocolate Cartel is never something i ever thought id hear but im here for it
Nobody gonna beat Johnny Deep
"Gotta love yet another remake of Willy Wonka that will fail miserably compared to the original Why Because they obviously dont understand what made the original so amazing  Gene Wilder More specifically his wit and humor So now we have some cheap remake from todays most popular young male actor that will have the same bland writing that all Hollywood does now 
Yet another astonishing example of mediocrity kicking a dead horse for money I dont care how nice and feel good the message is they are missing the whole damned point"
I bet Mulaney is furious
Who saw Hugh Grant and thought Oompa Loompa
Didnt Johnny Depp already ruin this
This looks great Im so excited to see it
Hm No blatantly character bashing with Wonka Not something I expected in a modern film with the obsessive reimagining so here take my skeptical optimism
mmmmm nah Im good
Wonkas canon event
The new Dune movie really is a departure from the first one
He he said its Wonkin time my jaw dropped to the bottom of the Mariana Trench
A 3rd WONKA MOVIE
Surprised Willy wonka isnt black 
You know Im something of a scientiest myself
GETTING RELEASED RIGHT AFTER MY BRITHDAY
LIKE THIS COMMENT IF YOUR THINK THAT ARIES ARE AWESOME 
Cant wait to see this movie 
Hmmmmm not about this Wilder still set the bar on this character to a level that most cannot reach
what the heck
black
Theyve remade an adult movie by making it a prequel its for kids because its about candy
First Mission Impossible Oppenheimer Barbie and now Wonka Wonderful
Idk thought this trailer was oretty wonky at places
Isnt Willy wonka a pedo
Brings a tear to my eye This is actually how the best chocolate in the world started out not from forced labor in third world countries but a purplesuited clown with dreams of flying in the air Its such a powerful message
I dont understand why people are hating on this hes not over acting and even if they did a lot of different versions of the movie its different in its own way like I think it will be worth watching
Hes not even acting hes just talking 
Still bummer that they didnt include Pure Imagination to be a soundtrack or did they
Wow more forced diversity Very much a shame
Nah pls Tell me its not just me cuz this trailer is too goofy
why they only cast the same top actors
WB 
Its Fred in another life
MR BEAN
I smell more woke bs
looks awful
Willy Wonka but its not the same
Lmao Gonna be huge flop
Giggity
Does anyone miss johny depp Coz i doo
The move is not even out yet and we already have conservatives crying about wokeness and how black actors in media will ruin their lives
Wait is that Timothe Chalamet or Daniel Thrasher
Narkotyki w czekoladzie
Anyway you guys can come up with an original idea for a movie
NOOOOO I WANT JOHNNY WONKA
In other parallel world willy wanka I watch it
He was real good in bones and all
Willy Wonka accent is wrong He is British
I just vomited a little in my mouth
Gene wilder is the only willy wonka
All the bots in the comments are really excited to see this movie
I actually like the trailer Cant wait to see it 
I want Johnny Depp back
Why
Looks like another American dream story And all this dancing and flying is just soooo boring The movie looks like a flop to me
I like the part at the end were he goes its wonkin time classic
So were now making normal sized people small folks Like their roles arent limited anyways
This looks more like Marry Poppins than Willy Wonka
hahahahaha
Is he acting or being a clown
Jonny Depp another level 
"No day dreaming

5 penalty 


"
I am going to watch this movie and Im going to love this movie
What tf is this
What a stellar cast
Epic
This actually looks like itll be quite good and I dont usually say that about stuff
I dont think Willy wonka needs a 3rd movie
I am missing Johnny Depp 
OMGG
MATT BAYNTON YOSSSSSSSS
OMG I CANT WAIT THIS SEEMS LIKE A GREAT MOVIE
Where is Jim Carrey he should have been in this movie
The actor for wonka is like a mix of Daniel thrasher and a bit of matpat
I love how they basically incorporated both willy wonkas into one
Hes the kwisatz haderach of chocolate making
So the little boy now has to be a little black girl of course  Why do they keep remaking films that dont need remade and blackwashing and race swapping characters that werent made that way Not even Johnny Depps version cant touch Gene Wilder in the original The reviews arent gonna be nice The main actor however looks great in his part
Ah yes they made Wonka into a 16 year old
Yo Im excited
This Wonka isnt unsettling and creepy like the Johnny Depp version I appreciate that
"Media exec guys we have no ideas so make a wonka prequel and get me some money
Staff oh sure a wonka movie will definitely make a money
Media exec why did you say that weird"
I get there trying to capture Gene Wilders Willy Wonka but the only thing in my head right now is Christian Boyles Wonka
Timmy nailed it
Why is there a blk girl
003 Dear Wonka why do you wear a top hat and colorful suit Dear Wonka why do Oompa Loompas work for you How did you make your first candy How do you come up with new flavors Now hold on Hold on This movie can answer all your questions
Holy botted comment section
"Seriously A black side kick Had to cram that in there ehh Every single time The J tricks never end 14

Embrace your folk Your heritage Your traditions These are all European stories Never forget 14"
is hollywood out of ideas
HOW IS THIS FR
Omg
Nope Not going to waste time or money on this The original is perfection Sick of Hollywood destroying the classics
""
A Young Wonka before he got his Factory this is Awesome
Isnt as elegant as Johnny Depp Lacks charisma
I loved it when he said Its Wonking Time and Wonked all over the screen one of the movie moments of all time
Really do hope they dont mess up my childhood
Timothy Chardonnay cant act
I cant wait 
I like Timothy but just by this trailer his acting looks really terrible
Nah
Why do they keep remaking this movie
"they get younger and younger




weirdly"
Idk why people are dissing on the movie Its not even a remake its more of a back story to how Wonka started his factory Its reminds me of The Greatest Showman
w oompa LOOMPA
Is this before he became absolutely insane because Timothy has the right look but O dnt think hes capturing Wonkas essence right
Ayo ngl willy be looking like the perfect twink
Warnerbros is the best This is amazing WB Forever
Finally 
"141 Teletubbies reference









What I mean is Dipsy shouted RUN AWAY when he was being chased by LaaLaa who is forcing Dipsy to wear the skirt"
The opportunity to hear Hugh Grant sing will be worth the price of admission alone
gene wilder and johnny depp had a much more sarcastic and funny attitude i dont see timothy fitting in well with this movie
Stop remaking movies come out with some different ideas
"multiverso filme live action dc comics james gunn

Bro idk why people  are hating on the trailer its not bad it seems like a nice movie
Was Johnny Depp too old
MBMBAM made me thing this wasnt gonna be real But nope I need it
124 is bath spa remember seeing the fake snow at Christmas 2021 with all the extras and the exact vehicle props so surreal seeing it come to life
I cant watch this even if I wanted too because I cannot see Paul Atreides in any other light than what I currently see him in Even watching this trailer is playing with fire
We didnt need this
He dont fit da wonka aesthetic hes a great actor nonetheless Def gonna hate this movie so Im just not gonna watch it
 
White guy with black girl again So obvious the media is pushing this hard but why
Nick Cage should play Willy Wonka This kid looks too young
ummm copying mikes mic much
Woke Wonka will wither away
Thought it was gonna be weak like the last one but this looks dope tbh
Amazing  movie
Im excited honestly The team sounds great
"New Wonka coming in like Jack Sparrow on a ship Ive spend the past 7 years traveling the world perfecting my craft to try and become Johnny Depp
He might need a little more work"
023 That lightning bolt looks like Shazam logo
Chalamet as a Wanka Johnny never regrets
Someone didnt have the right idea for the movie  Its true what they say less is more
Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over Thank you Roald Dahl
Continually refusing to cast midgets in fear of upsetting midgets is always amusing
Im so freaking excited
No one can beat the action of the real willy wonka Jonny Depp he is a class
Hollywood has officially gone too far burn it
Instead of remakesretelling of this story Im still waiting for a proper sequel showing what happens after Charlie inherited the chocolate factory
mrbean as cameo 140
This looks awesome 
this is going to be very hit or miss
I still love to see Sir Christopher Lee as Willys father 
Wouldnt it be cool if a younger version of Charlies grandfather appeared in this movie
Nice
Hollywood is too scared to actually cast small people for roles that they would excel in thus leaving already challenged and underworked actors with even more challenges and even less work This isnt about being politically correct its about appeasing the insatiable hive mind This new trend of excluding small people is a spit in the face to those who would bring life to these roles more than any laughable CGI could ever do The self proclaimed progressive continue to be regressive in every way possible
Remember this is not Burtom version this is coming from the first version of Wonka 
Is that a Jack Dylan Grazer
I must say I am a Dahl bookWilder loyalist but this actually looks pretty great  Silly and quite visually beautiful  Im sure there will be lots of awful eyeroll moments but this looks pretty cool on the whole
I thought willy wonka acted like mad hatter 
This is going to be garbage
Another woke production We already have a Wonka movie which I dont think can be surpassed
I love how this is 100 a Christmas movie without being about actual Christmas The outfits and whole aesthetic Christmas was definitely the vibe they where going for
Rowan atkinson is back the legend  is here 
Ahhh kant wait 
STILL NOT LIKE JOHNNY DEPP
This looks stupid The chocolate cartel Gtfoh wont even waste my time
""
Omg mr bean 
From the director of Paddington literally sold
A tHIrD WonKa mOvIE
129 Always love an epic version of a classic theme tune even if Ive only heard it about twice in my life
They probably changed the whole plot of the movie to fit in a minority main character
If its directed by the director of Paddington this HAS to be good
TIMOTHEEEEEE
Not a good actor
It looked stupid but fun
No
At this point Im just glad Chris Pratt isnt in it
Why Justwhy
Timothy Chalame an actor with charming colors
Just excuse me while I go fangirl in the corner
Charlie in a chocolate factory  That is very nice  I have each chocolate in Christmas and  Halloween and  Valentine  
Why do I feel like this is gonna be a flop
Is that just me or was that Rowan Arkinson 140
              
I miss Johnny 
i just knew they had to enclude a black child cause of diversity
Old wonka so good but this one 
i have to see this now bruhhhhhh
When Timothee Chalamet grabbed that nut I was sure i was going to watch this movie
God I hate Hollywood now more than ever
who up wonkin they willy rn
My favorite part of the trailer was when he said its wonkin time and then willy wonked all over the place
        
I like Chalamet but Im sorry hes just not the guy for this role Just like Tom Holland wasnt the guy for the role of Nathan in Uncharted
Way too many nigs Im out
I love the oompa loompa ahaha Although its kinda strange seeing the difference in Toms performance vs Jonny depps back then
east or west johnny depp is the best
I have a good feeling about this one
wtf why isnt wonka black this time reported
Its unbelievable they already did a prequel telling the story of Paul Atreides Man its way before he fights the Harkonnens but boi does it feel very natural ngl
So is this what WB is replacing Fantastic Beasts with
The Late Gene Wilder would be approvedCant Film This For WaitWhat opps Strike That Reverse ItCant Wait For this Film It Will Be Scrumdeliumcoussss 
The background song of candycrush makes it nostalgic
"Looks nothing like the book or the spirit of Roald Dahl  Willy Wokea
Sad to something else destroyed"
Cant wait to see the underground sandworm habitat to produce Wonkas Special Spice Slip of Silly
Another wb cash grab Gross
"Director Tim we need you need to study willy wonka for this upcoming movie
Tim loads up danielthrasher channel say no more"
This film looks a little wonky
this i have to see when it comes out
Where did the black girl come from
This guy is following in some massive footsteps Hes collecting a role played by two incredible actors Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp Good luck kid
awwwww
So this is what Paul Atreides wouldve done if hed left Dune after his dads death
I dont like what I see but Ill watch it anywayI guess thats any movie they make with The Chalamet
scratch that reverse it
I really wish he has real magical powers and not a regular mortal
Well at least its not called Willy
he is going to do a good job
timmy t amo
Nice
Its exciting but he looks so independent from the two previous interpretations by Gene and Johnny
i just saw mr bean
Not another wonka Yuck Come on Hollywood get some new ideas Not wasting my money
Anyone else hearing I chimed in with a havent you people ever heard of closing the god damned door
young actors have zero charisma nowadays  horrible actingboring
Gene Wilder and Julie Dawn Cole are the best no contest Never how many reboots will never compare
The original is the greatest movie ever made Johnny Depp was not good in the remake Glad were getting a prequel 
johnny depp batter
This is very different from the old one like it is one of my favs from childhood
i havent felt such joy since despicle me gru forever baby 
This actually looks like a fun family movie to watch its been way too long my dear friend
Mr bean got a new job
Oh look Another diversity movie with the token black kid and overhyped orchestral background music to a TERRIBLY written script Im assuming is writtenproduced by AI and will most likely bomb Im seriously suspicious with this big studios
Who is that child and why is that adult man hanging out with her
Oh gosh idk
im just here to sayno
 Think Ill pass on this one
This is so disknee channel lmao 
Willy wonka and the chocolate community
I might like this
Casting Timothe as Wonka is a total fail I love him as an actor but he doesnt match the Wonka personality people grew up loving
This is going to be EPIC  perfection GGs WPTimothy is the perfect casting choice Brilliant this is young JD Edward Scissor Hands Benny  Joon vibes brava 
"Here we go again Forcing out white people from white culture and jamming black people in our place 
Surprised they didnt race swop Willie himself for a black woman"
"The way Wonka is portrayed in this trailer feels very He was cast because he is a popular name and the studio hopes it will sell the film and not that he had to audition against tons of other actors for this role  Especially if hes portraying the Gene Wilder Wonka  I dont get the whimsy from him like from Wilder he just seems like the usual good natured guy in an underdog story that weve seen a thousand times before  But I dont see WIlly Wonka  Maybe this is just a bad trailer for showing off his best moments as Wonka but I dont see it yet  Not even in the slightest  Its like hes in this halfway house between Depp and Wilder but hes not committing fully to either but hes also not throwing in the same amount of whimsy or eccentricities of them either Its like hes holding back from going fully into eccentric whimsy and that may work for other characters but for Wonka turning up both is a necessity 

The atmosphere and the setting and the music all sounds wonderful  But for this to work Wonka has to work and Im not seeing it yet I hope it does"
This looks horrible
This is probably the 3rd Reboot  of that story
starting to see a pattern in movie titles nowadays
lmao this is comically miscast
"Wonka is Johnny Depp

Timothe Chamalet is LilyR0se Depps ex boyfriend"
Sad this doesnt have anything from 2005 wonka  didnt like the original was excited to see they made a remake w depp  really enjoyed that one  SMH
This movie is Ugly asf  Johnny Depps role and Movie is 1010 a Masterpiece period
I REALLY want to see this
Why do we need another bloody Wonka film
Love the trailer for wonka but I find it hilarious that Hugh Grant is a Oompa Loompa that is more fancy
ITS DANIEL THRASHER
Woke
Noooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I must watch this in theaters
Im obsessed with him
No ty
Nice trailer
Here we go mama
This guy looks like Daniel Thrasher
Imagine they show Charlies grandfather asking for a job in the post credit scene
No original ideas lol
Oompa Loompa doompely doo
willy wonka is originally british not american also this movie looks to not be like the Charlie and the chocolate factory movie but a musical
This absolutely aint it Cant Warner Bros come up with new original IPs instead of bastardising their back catalogue
honestly i would like to see in the first movie umpa lumpa
i cant wait 3
""
Willy Wokea
Who up willying they wonka
Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity
awsome WB no crazy forcing inclusion and LGTASDASDAZ on the movie and focus more in entertaining
Roald Dahl is and always was my homie The way I ate up his books to escape my own reality
I keep forgetting timothee isnt 17
Why do I get Daniel Thrasher vibes
I appreciate that this is a cute origin story and not them trying to remake it or twist it into something dark
I loved the Charlie and the chocolate factory movie when I was a kid now Im hoping hoe this will turn out
This changed my mind I definitely want to see it now
His acting is so bad here wth
I wonder if Johnny Deep will wanna see this movie
timotheee chalamet is the only person that can play willy Wonka in Wonka the movie
Willy Wonka
that is simply so coooll Once weve started we cant stop haha gonna love this 
do you yall think this will be promising
Good
Ryan Renolds Should of played the Part Hes almost got the same voice
academy awards loading
They made Willy wonka culry
REWORK REWORK REMASTER REWORK REWORK  I HATE HOLLYWOOD
it look like alife
Who up wonking they willy rn
I feel Jhonny deep is best for willy Wonka
Oh nah
Theyre doing a new film called Wanka its going to be Piers Morgans life story
Looking forward to watching it 
OHHHH ITS HIS CHIKDHOOD LMAO
Poor johnny depp i wish he wouldve been willy wonka again
"Aint no way
The 4th one"
From peaches to chocolates oh my Elio 
Why does he look like Daniel Thrasher
Its just EW
I like this It looks a lot less creepy than the original
I thought movie stars are supposed to be handsome fellas 
Lost me at nodaydreaming This is not a rated G for all ages This is a live action fairytale just for kids No thank you This is not a worthy prequel
Wonka is hanging out with a little black girl for what reason now
Rowen Atkinson  producer of Harry Potter Timothy 
Man this gives me wonka vibes
cant wait to see it

"Again 
This was done twice already"
It better feature MrBeast
Wheres the sack of you know what Grandpa
I dont understand the mockery and hatred about Timothe Chalamets acting here Im not a big fan of him but ppl say his a bit overdramatic and I understand that but looking back to when adult Willie Wonka from the original film is he always did act that way his been weird and unusual but ppl loved him I know its such a huge part to fill in an iconic characters role but comparing to the new actors way of acting rn his doing alright and i like it atleast in my opinion
billions of dollars for another pointless movie in this lost world
La pelcula que ms espero del ao
Im so excited 
Depp
"Wait what isnt he a non binary person of colour with one arm 


Im outraged"
Never been less excited for a movie
Its mr bean for me
"Director of Padding
Producer of Harry Potter
Hopefully it will be a masterpiece film and of course very good in terms of acting cinematography music and whatever it is that makes this film good"
NO NO JUST NO  please just leave the original I get Hailey was a game changer for those who need visuals to help find our identities but Johny didnt need a replacement there is no replacement its like ur making me ready for a new Captain Jack Sparrow I aint signing up although blessed are the production team company and talents but no man
This actor is becoming annoying with his real life arrogant and pompous behavior
They cannot come up with new movies so they remake old nonsence ones
Yeah they really didnt need to make another one of these
Hmm looks fun but Ill to wait for the ESG rating to come out
Oh take my damn money Im so sat  
very nice
I cant wait
Wonka keeps getting younger
seriously arent people tired of this Every version has been terribleand the previous wonkas have been some of my favourite actors
Is the sorry been reversed by timeline and what we are seeing it is before the Willy wonka factory
Nope I wont spend a penny After Johnny this is what you found Overrated actor
No
Yeah the commercial is cool and all but Im wondering when lil mabu became an acter
scratch that reverse it was my fav part haha aside from Hugh 
Better than mermaid disney
We didnt need this film nor Timothee
This is unbelievable I didnt think I will see this in my life I love this movie so much
I swear I just saw Mr bean
Nobody asked for this nor want it
Lets see where this goes 
I feel like its probaly gonna need a name change Willy Wokea Im sure it will b another woke hollywood movie Seems to b the theme remake and go woke to push agendas I will b shocked if its not a woke dumpster fire
Not sure about casting him for that it feels less natural than his other roles
Random black girl obviously
Did you just say scratch that reverse it 018
Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa Count me in
Timothe Chalamet being upbeat and not brooding or eccentric is trippy
I can not wait to go and watch this movie
This looks so cool I cant wait
116 Theyre not defying the laws of gravity Theyre just having fun
First to reply to this comment is gqy
My favourite part is when he says Its Willyin time Then proceeds to just get his Willy all over the place Wild
Will there will be Grampa Joe as one of the first workers of Willy Wonka
So proud of Daniel Thrasher finally starring in his own movie 
CHOCOLATE FACTORY
Honestly looks like bad writing
Stop destroying old films and even worse making them woke What is it with the new wave of woke remakes
i liked the original oompa loompas better but the rest looks very well portrayed
It looks like garbage 
Jesus is the Way the Truth and the Life Jesus said to Thomas I am the way the truth and the life No one comes to the Father except through Me There is only one way to heaven That Way is Jesus and his word of truth No other can grant us eternal life
only reason im seeing the movie is too see mr bean say run away
152 From one mamas boy to another I love this scene
This actually looks very good
it feels weird seeing timothee chalamet here because he does more serious roles like i cant see him as being wonka i see him as timothee 
Lets take Charlie out of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and replace Willy Wonka with the depressed Dune guy
stormi now has a wonka daddy and billionaire mom 
There was no need for making this
I actually think the over the top body movement fits Wonka as a character but Chalamets line delivery is not it
WONKA
naaaaah aint gonna watch it depp will always be my wonka
"I was very happy with
 Charlie and the chocolat
   factory                                 "
The movie nobody needed nor asked for Sweet
This is unbelievable I didnt think I will see this in my life I love this movie so much
Different one
"wwoaoaoaoaaat ROwan Rowan is there
well i gotta watch this"
I loved this book growing up so excited to see this movie
wanker 
why are there so many good films coming out suddenly P
Just nope
This movie looks horrible tbh
It looks amazing
I dont understand why everything gets remade Its like people ran out of ideas Not only that books and movies from years back were just so much better
I think this is gonna be awesome
Johnny Depp is the best irreplaceable for these roles
But Johnny depp Willy Wonka was the best
Ink if Im dreaming or not
MR BEAN
Did I see Rowan Atkinson
Pure cringe These people are creatively bankrupt The 1971 adaptation was a master piece in every aspect and will most probably never be outdone
They should have made Hugh Grant into Willy Wonka
Spoiler alert his chocolate business is successful
Nope
I wonder if black actors ever worry if they got their gig because of their race and not their acting abilities
hotdogye
JHONNY DEPP WILLY WONKATIMOTHY WILLY WONKA
ya dejen de arruinar las cosasdonde  o cuando tendran sus propios logros basta de recurrir al pasado para crear cine asquerosolo pasado queda en el pasado con sus buenos logros
At First i thought its a Disney Movie
compared to Johnny Depp this mediocre actor looks like a homeless man in old rags and with a big top hat which obviously doesnt suit him
terrible
Nice Trailer
"how many time have you watch this 


me yes"
where is mrbeat
Wow its gonna be an awesome movie
I am crying
This is either going to fail hilariously or exceed everyones expectations somehow
I like this move 
Johnny Depp is the best Willy Wonka ever
i cant wait this is going to be too good
Mr Bean as a running priest
The Johnny depp version of Willy wonka was Aok but this is a masterpiece First he had his father in the depp movie now his mother
barbenheimer times up now its wonkpoleon turn to shine
The chocolate industry is way darker than dark chocolate
Bruh why cant they think of anything original every series legacy gose more in the negative everytime they make a remake or new version
I loved the part where he said This is going to take crackerjack timing Wonk
This is the Drake movie
Hugh Great playing an adorable oompa loompa gives me life 
They really cant make new movies anymore hollywood is a f joke
Who saw the mum form Paddington blowing kisses
the back ground song of candycrush makes it more nostalgic
Kim Kardashian dont like wonka
The actor is not good enough
I love the part when he says its wonking time and wonks all over the place
I like how theyre choosing to expand on the Gene Wilders version of Willy Wonka
yeaah willy wonka i hope can get a golden ticket to enter his chocolate palace
""
Ngl Id easily rate this a 5 star if they at least give a Grandpa Joe cameo since he worked in the factory
OMG best present for xmas cant wait
Just Like OZ the Great And powerful
Looks like fun
Nice
Looks like its gonna be a great movie and i know that because the plot was explained and broken down in this video
I think this is going to be a perfect Christmas movie 
Oh well its the 2020s What am I expecting good CGI
I see mr Bean and thats why im gonna watch it
those ompalompas dont look like theyre from lompaland
whos up wonking their willy rn
Best trailer since barbie
I dont know why i felt jhony depp
Still no originality in film
Doesnt look too bad cant wait to see it 
Ad mr bean
A much needed Christmas present in 2023 
Nothing to see here just a few people defying the laws of gravity
OMG Willy Wonka
Just remind me of johny deep
DISLIKE
So nobody noticed mr bean
Please let this man do  Edward scissor hands too
Sad that depps not willy again 
This looks both awful and utterly pointless
The Oompa Loompa is the funniest
A new remakeNo more ideas huh
"All of Willy Wonka movies
1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 
2005 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
2017 Tom and Jerry Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 
2023 WONKA"
Super video
he isnt nearly charming enough
Well here we go again  cant create a new license with new characters and a original story  lets just vandalize an original and call it better  
Date of release
mr bean as a priest run awayyyyy
I personally prefer the 2004 Willy Wonka
I love Timothee but the nOpE sCrAtCh tHat rEvErsE iT 
Johnny Depp
Nice that this is a prequel and not a cheap version of previous movies
His dad better be a dentist
Gas the cast
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe
Johnney Depps character is the best so far
For me Wonka should be an other worldly and slightly disconcerting character and Im just not getting that vibe from this
Just pure LOVE
Just came here cos I needed a laugh after Oppenheimer
Another flop from WB A prequel to Robert Dahls Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory childrens novel seriously Its written by none other than two guys who have zero previous experience with writing a story let alone writing a movie Just stop making these prequel films to other writers work Its gonna be just like that Ring of Power show where Amazon thought they could make their own prequel to JRR Tolkeins books and hired two writers that also had zero experience with writing a story and television show
This looks awful Poor Tim tim
Wonderful the story how Wonka came to be
""
No
Why does it feel and sound like wonkas actor is doing one of those cringe pov character tik tok things this guy isnt fitting at all and also Why another wonka movie
Quiet listen and down up
willy wonka now
Oh no not that guy to play Wonka
Willy Twinka
Johnny depp was way better
Another dumb remake film again  Stop destroy good film and make your original film  Dont any companies ever come up with any new original films anymore  Films are getting remake and remake all over again and again  This is getting very tiring and pretty bad  If we dont get race swapping then we will get feminist films or just totally bad films  Oh boy 
el here we go mama omgg
hughhhh grant as ompa loompa
timothee es un gran actor
me encanto
Willie Woka 
NO
I prefer milk chocolate over anything else Anyone else besdies me
Ive always sorta wondered about the origins of Willy Wonka and my wish is about to be granted
142 is that MrBean speaking
mi hijo es fan de estas peliculas
omaigaddd
"Hahaha i was wondering why it seems like a Harry potter movie 
Guess it makes sense the producer is the one from Hp movies"
O so this is the younger version like how wonka became wonka Nice
Hell yes A good movie that makes us forget about Disneys lackluster debauchery
It looks intriguing cant wait to see it once you pay your actors and writers
Ok I do love the original movie and Im crazy about Wonka but partly bc hes so mysterious Idk if I want an origin story
Wanted Johny depp as wonka  he wouldve nailed it
More Dwarfs losing a job
Yeah ill pass this one
Its SO great seeing Timothe playing these kind of character so different of what we usually see him interpret  Im excited for this it looks cute and heartwarming 
More woke nonsense
Cant wait for Wonka to start cooking blue rock crystals candy
The is amazing
Again a woke movie Unnecessary shoving black characters
Wow Willy is actually still a male  those MAGA fundamentalists at Warner
Im still trying to figure out whether charlie is a grown man or not And Wich movie or they basing this one off  of    
timothee rn being the best actor of our generation i love him so much
tomo holland never could
timothee is such a versatile actor i love him
Half the cast is off Peep Show lol
todos vamos a verka mi novio
que hermoso que buena actuacion
t amo tim
me enamora timothee
JD better
The Kwisatz Haderach opens a candy store Yeah I can see that
Should have been Charls Carroll
Why has nobody made a movie about Charlie being in control of the chocolate factory
i liked how they put black people in fitting roles not pushed the black people down our throats
Nope
This looks promising
hes too pixie dream girl and not enough manic
Idk bout this
Nick eh 15 should be a oompa loopa
Nope So much nope All the nope
I actually unironically adore the trailer for wonka
"Well I can only think of one word to use for this
Scrumdiddlyumptious"
Hes missing the Johnny Depp character I got used togood for him getting the role though
Pathetic
This is a movie I will be taking my son to and Im excited that its a different retelling because I dont know how many more remakes I can handle mentally 
No
charlie and the chocolate factory is my alltimefavorite book and movieI hope they dont ruin it
Isnt it kind of ironic that LillyRose Depps father and exboyfriend both played Willy Wonka
I was bout to say WHERE THE UMPA LUMPAS This movie is really gonna bring about 4 generations together
i cannot WAIT for this
"His acting sounds so forced and fake
Im sorry I just dont get the appeal of Timothee Chalamet as a character actor"
Lil mabu changed careers
Willy Wonka
Nice movie
Nooooo why Another  remake 
HORRIBLE HISTORIES
Looks like ds
Wait Im so confused how will this tie into the fact he was raised by a dentist then ran off to the chocolate factory 
Nothing to see here just a group of people defying the laws of gravity
Looks trash  but who knows it just might be a good movie  hugh grant playing an oompa loompa is not a good idea though
Completely charmless Idiots making trash films for simpletons
This looks exCEEDINGLY dumb
"Better show how he became such a gloomy man as well The original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory had a very sad and lonesome Willy We should know why

Also dont so a remake of The Neverending Story"
wow I hate the raceforced characters switch them up to fit naturally with the roles and it would be fine but force specific roles to fit the racerule seems off looks like a good movie ignoring that tho
Ah the singing dancing happy go lucky white savior wonka movie about workers rights exactly how its always been
super duper excited about the movie but why is it not JOHNNY DEPP I was expecting him at the end atleast
F mr bean
Ive never laughed at a movie trailer Hugh grant as the oompa loompa made me chuckle definitely seeing this movie
Na he cant act I could do better
My childhood has returned
Cringe  try hard lol shows how great of an actor Johnny is
Well that was stupid
I love Timothy Chalamet but he looks more like Charlie than Willy Wonka
So this is actually supposed to be like the beginning of Willy Wonka I think they should say the beginning of Willy Wonka I think a lot of people getting confused its that beginning to start
bro his backstory already was explained
My first thought AGAIN  But after seeing the trailer  Its a Willy in the beginning  Interesting
Im just happy theyve brought back the original Oompa Loompa song Although Hugh Grant looks great I wish they would have hired Dwarf actors like the original They need jobs too
Willy Wokena 
wow so no one saw Mr Bean
Sign The Contract To Go See This Movie On Christmas In IMAX
So where is Charlie
Prophet Mohammad does not approve
Chalamet isnt quietly nuts enough for this Shouldve been Daniel Radcliffe
TOM Holland could have been Wonka too
Odd that Wonka is not black
An Oompa what now 
OMGGG  cant waitt
No blacks in my Wonka
Hopefully this will do good
Not timotee chalame he sounds weird
i wouldve loved to see someone like matt smith take up the role of wonka but im def gonna watch this
I must say I liked Johnny Depp better as a Willy Wonka character
"Wonka beats the barons by creating a monopoly

Very creative"
I CANT FREAKIN WAIT 
Goshhh Im soo excited 
Harry Potter vibes
I thought Wonka was supposed to be awkward
Chocolates chocolates nd chocolates
He looks like Daniel Thrasher
125 Karl
Another trash remake nice thanks for that
At least the Oompa Loompa looks less scarier than in the Willy Wonka from the 1920s
BUTLERMAN
Looks like dogshit
Ngl i love that line every good thing in this world started with a dream so hold on to yours
Afuckinotherone
oh notimmy is not crazy enough for this characternopethe trailer is already so bad
when i seen rowan atkinson in it i was hooked
Why
ollie
Woke garbage
Johnny Depp was the best No matter how hard you try you cant erase him
Cenas lindas de se ver gostei
Miss Johnny Depp
This movie looks like 
I love how he said its wonkin time and willyed all around the place
I love how he said its wonkin time and willyed all around the place
I love how he said its wonkin time and willyed all around the place
I love how he said its wonkin time and willyed all around the place
I love how he said its wonkin time and willyed all around the place
Pretty jewish girl
When I look up Snowpiercer this trailer is one of the first results
Willy Woker
Well this is just rehashed Hollywood shite
Dont get why people are hating on this it looks good
Johnny Depp is my favorite
Dune part 2 looks crazy
here comes another bomb
ROWAN ATTKINSOONNNN 
The problem with this movie is that its made by the production company that made the harry potter films So this film has a harry potter vibe with all the magic and thats the flaw they are so obsessed with harry potter that they put the harry potter influence in all their films now
Can we just not and say we did
Love it dude
What A white male as Willy Wonka Thats an unexpected relief
A wonka that is not Johnny Depp uuuf
Ha Ha Ha  black actors again
nice movie
Bro this is gonna be one of those good origin movies
Imagine when we were getting actual good movies before now its just sequels remakes reboots offspins
My bad I cant imagine  anyone as willy wonka expect Jonny Depp
Cant wait for December 15 
"142 
Mr Bean "
I love it how 5 minutes ago we had a WWTCF remake and now we get another one And CGI Oompa Loompas
Who cares
"They have ruined it I cant
I cant anymore
They havent done the originals justice at all"
"My prediction for the opening titles 


Warner Bros Pictures 
Presents 


In Association With 
Village Roadshow Pictures 


A
Roald Dahl Heyday Films
Production 




Wonka 







Idk if its the actual opening credits"
Not creepy enough
Period drama  Childhood character  Happy days
This movie is incomplete without Wonkas dentist dad 
Willy Wokena No thanks Here have some chocolate
"So they brought Tim Burtons Batman
Now his Willy Wonka
What next
His Beetlejuice"
i have a bad feeling about this
""
Cringe af 
was that mr bean at 142
From the moment I see  From the producer of Harry Potter I saw Gryffindor Hufflepuff Ravenclaw and Slytherin
so much Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts vibes
i saw Rowan Atkinson
Johnny Depp 
The Hugh Grant oompa loompa will feature in my nightmares
Utter Bs
I cant get out from johnny depp wonka image forever
"wow hopefully this movie is good dont want little timmy messing the most iconic character up now do we

anyway all jokes aside im glad they used references from the original movie
"
Well I havent read the books or saw the first adaptation of it I want to say I feel a tad skeptical about this one I think I will try to consider this movie as a separate work from all the adaptations and the book but I dont know there is something that doesnt quiet sit right with me
Nobodys gonna replace Depp Hes the man always

NOW THERES A WONKA TRILOGY
WHY WHY ARE THERE SO MANY MOVIES COMING OUT THIS YEAR
Everything is good except the fact that they use chalamet face as willy wonka I dont know its just my preference by the way  ps no hate for timothee i love him
I rather more interested in a prequel
Yo is that rowan atkinson 102
I dont know how to feel
BOMB
When is the premiere  night showing here in Philippines 
May god have mercy on your doomed souls you pack of money grabbing cabbages 010
Isnt Wonka based on that British child molester celebrity
This movie is very good and will definitely win the oscar
Mr bean
Years later and still this is a story to be told over and over Thank you Roald Dahl
Yes we back it again
Reminds me of Treasure VolKno Imma willy wonka
Bro lets be honest Wonka is Johnny Depp its childhood and I cant take any other actor on this role
Incredible that majority of the positive comments have random numbers after their usernames

Why
The3rd one D
I am antiumpa lumpa guyz
This is dis is gonna be legit lit lmak hqha
Um the Hugh Grant thing stronger than the spectacle Promising Chalamet Wishing the best
Is this a prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
Has potential but based on this it is a NO GO NO SEE from me
WB trying to outwoke Disney is hilarious
yooo I cant wait
This feels like more pretentious new world order woke garbage I wont spend money to see It could have been good had they left it the journey of Wonka  but its diversity first and story must comply with wokeness Sigh
Nothing will ever beat the original Im sorry
I never thought wed get a prequel of this character
I love Hugh Grant but not using an actual little person actor for an Oompa Loompa is disappointing Peter Dinklage would have been amazing
Surprised they didnt hire a black actor to play Wonka 
I smell Woke
Finally a new idea even if it has our classic characters  in it
"The original Willy Wonka movie is legendary
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was pure garbage
This one looks promising actually"
Team 1971 and 2005
This looks awful doesnt make any sense
its like pissing up
If we get to see where the ompaloomoas and the wangdoodles were from thatd he cool
Im so going to the movies 
Looks so bad
Timotee chalamat is just the best person to play Willy Wonka
My eyes are puking This is the worst looking movie I have ever seen The actor is wrong for wonka and this feels like they are just making fun of the movie rather than it being a movie This movie should not exist
Who up willying their wonkas rn 
Sure Hope 2005 Wonka Sees This
Ok so its a prequel to Willy Wonka and how he got started  Not a remake of Gene Wilders Willy Wonka
WERE GETTING A THIRD WILLY WONKA MOVIE
Im out
Seems like an interesting story but I wish it didnt go against the story of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory especially with the Oompa Loompas Also the acting and written dialogue I already can tell is laughable Hard pass
the story is so contrived at this point that is loses any meaning
a film that does not need to exist
Nothing beats the classic oompa loompas no need for cgi
A family vibe
I knew Wonka liked himself some chocolate but never like this 
There is only one Johnny Depp
Token blacks in the moviemore  box ticking
Brilliant
absolutely not
This looks awful Wonka doesnt need an origin story
So this is how Wonka became the famous candyman
who be wlling they wonka for this movie
141 in case you missed the Legend MrBean
Wonka 
It looks so good
Y he and  where is Johnny Depp
Why they swapped the boy with a black girl
"Remember when Willy Wonka lead the rebellion against the Juarez cartel and put cocaine in his chocolate 
This movie looks wack"
Mr bean 103 he was there
Take james frank as Oompa Loompa 
Looks awful 
Looks like the most boring movie ever made but I will still watch it
Willy wonka is back
"Black Annie in Wonka Loompa
Me thinks not
Finally happenedNow they will give us Willie Woke nobody asked for
The nerve of Woke people"
Hmmmmmmm  This trailer did not inspire me to want to watch this movie  I have been looking forward to seeing it until I watched this  The only thing I liked about it and made me laugh was Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa
yeah what happend to the psychopath wonka
is that uniform french or german i dont think its british
He shoulda been cast Charlie lol not Willy lol
i think he could be more deranged
Johnny depp is best Wonka
Suprised they didnt cast a black dude as wonka
Are the token diversity hire blacks the only nonwhite race they could find even though they represent less than several other races in terms of population as opposed to race bait funded activism
If Rowan Atkinson is in the movie then it would be a blockbuster 
Rowan atkinson and hugh grant is all we need   Im excited 
Is this a musical Mehhhh
This is so mid its funny
Oh God Where is Johnny Depp
Wow reboot
019 Goofy ahh answer
Lets have Dune Wonka crossover
again oh god help hollywood
I but u Wonka will get kidnapped and the girl will have to safe him girlpower
Hopefully thisll be better than that GOD AWFUL Tom  Jerry crossover from 2017
total tripe
Giant Cringe Fest
Just noticed Rowan Atkinson is innit
willy wakanda
"No one asked for this to be remade again 

What are these people doing in Hollywood get some new material"
134 that hat looks similar to Indys
"full of blacks in a white world
no thanks"
Justin Trudeau acted well in this trailer 
Call upon Jesus and place your faith in him he loves you  Looks like a good movie btw
Wawwww
jonnnnyyyyyyyy333333
Disappointed they didnt make willy wonka black smh
Oh no
Im so excited for this move
wai wait huh whatIts Mr bean102
I laughed so hard at the end of oompa loompas dance Definitely gonna watch it
hahahaha i was thinking about another remake but looks like something new i like the idea
This looks like Crouching Tiger Hidden Wonka hahahaha  Trailer didnt sell me at all
Hmm I dunno about this one What I loved about Wonka in charlie and the chocolate factory is his mysterious nature and his odd personality Putting all of his back story out there just make his character lose the very thing that got me attached to the character Its not a bad concept but its just not for me Honestly the entire trend of Hollywood going antimystery and trying to explain and give a backstory for everything leaving nothing for the imagination is not to my taste at all But hey maybe Im just too old for the current hollywood
Timothy is the only kid actor that gives me goosebumps
Bon a na pas lair si mal
""
Really excited to watch Timothee Chalamet again 
oo idk wonka doesnt seem crazy enough wasnt the onset and depiction of willy wonka to be beyond common sense he doesnt act that way
Cant compete with Johnny depp
This is even much better that the matilda renake
Still remember Johnny depp Willy Wonka 
Youd have to be a total wonka to watch this
This kid cant act to save his life
Dunepaloompa  Looks good though Look forward to see what this Actor does after this too
So this is a movie about LSD
I knew I saw mr bean  somewhere
Ok wanka is back
from the director of Paddington and Harry Potter starring Timothee Chalamet  we all already know its gonna be good
""
Would have preferred Tim Burton to make this but Im excited nonetheless
Funny to still see the michael jackson influence
Please fing stop Thank goodness Hollywood is on strike or whatever
Ah finally the prequel to Snowpiercer 
This was the gene wilder verison not the johnny deep version
Is this movie for adults or children Like who are the target audience
Another movie Ill be skipping sadly 
Whoooo Im glad this isnt another ariel
SMH what a waste of Timothy and a legendary movie  oh well
"This could not have missed the point of the original story any more than it has
And sadly idiots will eat it up Roald Dahl would vomit if he saw this"
Looks cute
Johnny depp is best 
Old is gold Johnny depp  is best 
""
Would of been great if they got Johnny Depp again not this kid
Must watch
Can we not have a reboot please Noone wants to see another one Just make new ideas
Why is this feeling underwheling
yeah no thanks
mi rey te amo timothee
mo hay otro como timothe
this movie will be one of the most heart touching movie ever
eres el amor de mi vida timothee
timmi soe contigo anoche
te aoooooo
timmy precioso
t amo mi timmy bello
i think i saw mr bean lol
Mr bean yay
Im sorry but this IS EPIC AF FOR actually for all the right reasons Reply if youre hyped af as well
Can we just leave things as they were Why do we ruin everything who even asked for this
Timothe Chalamet ruins the character of Willy Wonka It doesnt seem right to me
Some things are so good that you dont want to try anything else you dont want to speculate What if scenarios Johnny Depps Willy Wonka is that thing Depp is so iconic that I wish nobody ever tried to speculate what if some other guy plays Willy Wonka
What the actual fck Hollywood has run out of ideas completely its embarrassing gene wilder will always be no 1 how do you top gene Johnny Depp fair play This s
Ok But I feel like there are to many whites in this movie Why not cast a Latinx or African American in wonkas role I feel like we are taking one step forward and 2 steps back maybe learn from Disney Warner bros
It seems to me a very nice trailer about a film that promises to talk about a boy who makes his dream come true It seemed to me that Chalamet took the role very seriously and in general all the cast and production theme seemed to have enjoyed making the project
MATHEW BAYNTON
MATTHEW BAYNTON IN A BIG MOVIE LIKE THIS IS CRAZY HE DESERVES IT YEAAAAAAAAAH
Mr Bean with choco
My family has a tradition of going to a movie after opening gifts and breakfast on Christmas Day and this looks perfect to carry that on
they follow the Tim Burtons theme that the hoompa loompas are singing and dancing but idk the the timeline Willy get out to his father i think he is 9yr old i guess but the era is already modern but here Willy is already teenager but his era is victorian
     
Me wondering who the girl is in a movie thats supposed to be about WIlly Wonka
MR BEAAAAAN IS HEREEEE
Nothing beats the 1971 orginal
NO one can replace the  place of jhony deep legend always legend
This doesnt sound like Wonka It looks like someone else put on a Wonka costume
Hope you the best in life you are a great acter and a awesome and great person 
Chalamet isnt working for me as Wonka He just sounds too sane 
Did anybody ask for this movie
Gonna be Barbenwonka
Is that Mr BEAN 141
I wanna see this
Love the ending when he says the true wonka were the friends we made along the way
030 no wonder wonkas chocolate tastes so good
This has to be Charlie when he grew up Omggg
goofy movie
Looks awesome Thankful they have the original style oompa loompas Cant wait for this to come out Im so there
At least Im not in the no daydreaming place id have to pay 2920 a year
""
why is he the lead
Me when dune timothy guy who are about to portrayed young Wonka version Warner   shut up and take my moneywe need young and smarty pants version of young wonka
cringe fest it looks so bad
My favourite part of this was when Willy Wonka said its Wonking time and Wonked all over the screen
to many good actors to be trueim excited
Is this the story on how the kid from the original willy wonka movie turned the chocolate factory into a bigger and better one
Looks great
Didnt see this coming Should be good
So He is the young wonka
I movie looks very cute cant wait I love that this trailer has a Monty Python reference followed directly by an Up reference 
140 Yo its mr bean
Im sorry but NO ONE WILL REPLACE mr Depp
Its another white savior movie
This looks terrible
Naaaaaahhhhhhh
This trailer gave me diabetes
Is looks harry potter universe
Well I never saw the Paddington movies but its clear Paul King has moved past his Mighty Boosh  Bunny and the Bull phase
Again
Wheres Veruca Salts
More small people out a job 
this looks so generic and formulated
mr wanka
Im honestly excited for this
Was that Mr Beaaaan
They also have mr bean as the lift operater
He looks like Jack Wolfe
She looks as out of place as if she were Mexican
From cannibalism to chocolate nice 
Hope it flops
Wait a minute did i just saw MrBean
i frickin love timothee chalamet
no
Mr bean
why timmy look like lil mabu
What happened to his father That was  a main character in his life 
This is gonna bomb so hard
So because this is a movie for children it has to be bad Pathetic
We need a willy wonka horror film
This actually looks like fun
Dey done made slugworth black
why not cast a real dwarf Oh hollywood
I dont like timothy chalamet in this role he doesnt fit it correctly
Uhhh this movie needs Pure Imagination Hope they got the Song xd
You couldnt find a real dwarf to play a frickin Oompa Loompa 
This whole movie looks like a mr beast challenge
Cringe
"Everyone Johnny Depp was the worst Willy Wonka He was too creepy

Me who actually read the book insert Thor Ragnarok meme Was he though"
God is a hairy humanoid soaking in a bathtub floating alone in a bubble of absolute and eternal solipsism imagining a world around itself in all directions
Actually looks like a good prequel
Wonka first in 1960s 2005 Tom and Jerry and now 2023
Wonka just always made magic candies Ive only seen the movies but those presented the magical candies as experimental and strange not something Wonka had been doing for years already that the public had seen and consumed already
We have to wait till Christmas
OMG yes 
Tbf itd cool in 10 when he ages up a bit go Charlie and chocolate factory and glass elevator this style
Not him trying to be quirky
This is gonna be soo good when it releases get this too 1k likes
I get the feeling theres gonna be more dark chocolate in this movie
 just no
This COULD be a decent movie since its not a total rewriting of the original story The black girl however is a new element if they keep with the original were Wonka is alone in his factory it could imply that she will eventually leave him or something bad will happen
dang never thought wonka was not being played by depp on this
Why does this look worse visually than Charlie and the chocolate factory a movie that came out lamost twenty years ago Why are all the colours so muted in a fantasyland movie for children PS I like Pope Mister Bean
I cant wait
You cannot beat the original with Gene wilder  Even the Johnny Depp version is better than this  Leave it alone and stop trying to remake a remake 
Timothy Chalamet has undeniable range Just watched the trailer for Dune 2  feels like two totally different actors
This looks amazing I already loved the other ones and I love Timothy Chalamets acting in dune
they should stop putty yoda in chargd of movie orders
i heard the reason this was so expensive to make is cos the camera equipment and rigging and lighting is actually made of chocolate hollywood is really impressive now i wish they would have more movies made of candy o
MARK LUCAS
IS THAT MR BEAN IM GOING TO WET MYSELF
Nobody beats jonny depp he will always be the best willy wonka period
This might actually be good
008 that might be the worst line i ever heard in a movie
I prefer the Mr Beast version
Wow this looks really bad in all honesty This trailer just confirmed my first reaction to the news of it
I love Hugh grant so much lol
See children This is how garbage is made
102 yo is that mr bean
Needed Johnny depp 
AGAIN  How many of this and Superman Spiderman Batman etc etc etc versions must we endure Can Hollywood ever be original again Thank God for Angel Studios for bringing us different and engaging movies
Im getting a lotta Cruella 2021 vibes right now
Excellent casting CGI physics is Meh Hopefully your writing and editing budget was sufficient
Terrible
why
Ok now I really want to see this 
Why this has the same energy as the cats movie
Rowan Atnikson is here too sick
The only wonka Ill watch other than Johnny deep is timothee so yay
I hope this one doesnt have as much body horror as the one with Johnny Depp 
Tbh this looks better then the last two Charlie and the chocolate factory movies combined
Well like the Willy Wonka himself said idk about this one lol
Johnny depps version of willy wonka
""
timotheee slayed
Europa The Last Battle is better
Very nice video
I grew up watching the old Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory back in the 90s saw the Johnny Depp Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a teenager Im 33 now and looking forward to this
Im excited   waiting for it
Willy wonka was a child murderer
His eccentricity sounds too fake
i hope i really like it i just cant get jhonny depps version out my head
Lost me the second they had to quote Jean Wilder Movie has no legs to stand on Want to watch a good wily wonka movie go see the original
Olivia Colman Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant All with Timothee Chalamet THIS MOVIE WOULD BE ON FIRE 
"At first I thought theyre making another Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory movie But now since I have watched the full previews it doesnt look so bad 
And I am looking forward to seeing Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa"
Plenty of blacks in this farce of a movie
Of course he has a chocolate woman
There is only one Willy Wanka Johnny Deep
Absolutely awful
They have to stop rehashing movies and you ingrates have to stop watching them Please create original content Please no more nostalgia or super heroes please for the love of god
If Gene Wilder was still alive hed love this
Making chocolate of course how do you like it Milky light dark NUTTY 
You either willy yo wonka or you wonka yo willy
trash
I dont want your future
Mr beann
AKA trying to push a young actor even if he is not fit fort he role THE MOVIE coming soon to empty theatres near you
Ouch
Im not getting any Gene Wilder vibes at all
How many times can Hollywood remake this movie
No one can replace Johnny Depp
i almost cant belive Netflix isnt behind this cringe fest
I like how there using the original ompa lompa style
Willy Wokea might not be well received this time around
Wow Ill watch it just to see Rowan Atkinson
I had low expectations But this just looks and feels so DELIGHTFUL 
i loved jdepp mahn dat man made me love nd hate tht character at the same time
I think johny dep will act as wonka but he isnt
103 Its ROWAN ATKINSON
I  those years there was not black people in Europe  They want to force multiculturalism in Europe As you can seewhen you travel to Paris or London is so disgusting  They have destroyed Europe
Johnson Alan Johnson
You know w hat Looks fun let us wait and see
Is that Mr Bean 141
My sweet tea I cant wait to seeya
Johnny depp is the Willy Wonka no one can beat him No hate for Timothee
There are tow actors that i want to see so im giving it a chance
I must see this that harry potter magic vibe really kicks in
This looks so bad
Gene Wilder God rest his soul will always be the best and only Willy Wonka
So WILLY has an unrelated CHOCOLATE little girl now I guess its true that Hollywood is full of pedophiles But at least this one is has a diverse cast that Timmy can stick chocolate roll into
Ouch
WOOOOOOO
This looks awful Timothy can not lead a film
Wonka like Alice in wonderland
i love the diversity in this but could of included more different colours of people
That girl
Original movie reboot
NO ONE REALLY SAW MR BEAN BRUH
Finally  trailer
hmm
I saw Mr bean so I watch it
Who wonkin up their willy while watching this
They going back my childhood days at year 2000 starring johnny depp
I used to think Timothee Chalamet had no talent but I was wrong It takes a specific skill to make Willy Wonka the most boring character in the movie
Hidung sama
Johnny Depp will always be my Willy Wonka
So this must be the origin story of Willy Wonka and I love it D
The best Wonka is Johnny Depp Excited to see how Timothy plays him Fun fact hes dated Depps daughter
Oh my goshh
Mr Bean
Its like a young Johnny Depp Willy Wonkas own movie 
wonka just johny depp
""
Wooowhhhh very wonderfull
Was that Charlies mum from the jhonny depp one
The fact that Rowan Atkinson is also casting this amazing show Goosebumps 
I was expecting johnny depp
Gotta be deleting the negative comments
Timothee doesnt look right in this part
not enough Asian and middle eastern representation
"Origin story of Willy Wonka 

I didnt know if I actually needed that"
My childhood has returned
This looks likes Peter Pan  Willy Wonka I like the old movies so im not sure if i will like this movie But I will keep my hopes up 
005014
This is the dumbest thing Ive seen in a while
Is it just me or the guy 141 looks like Rowan Atkinson lol
Mr bean
i loved the part where willy said its wonking time lets save the world from all non swiss chocolates truly one of the oneliners in history
""
timmy t amo
Youre telling me that Timothee Chalemet is playing Willie Wonka 
and theyre on strike
""
Am so up for Chalamet as Willy Wonka
Scratch that reverse it should be taken out thats Gene Wilders line as Wonka and thats the only Wonka that matters I was a kid 50 years ago so there
When he said strike that reverse it i shuddered Dont try to be Gene Wilder be your own Wonka
011 OMG
Gene Wilder would have loved this
Bruh
Missing jhonny depp
117 key and peele just key
Alan Johnson left JLB and made it to the movies  stick that up your dojo
I bet its CREEPY
Its the same but now there is a more diverse group of kids As if the USA in reality suddenly had a more diverse population lol
this is excellent but i got scared of oompa loompa even if its hugh grant
""
Thank you not just making another woke remake This actually looks good
why are there zero negative or critical comments it seems everyone thinks this is amazing already and Im barely interested after watching the trailer
Passing on this Woke trash  There is no franchise the woke writers wont ruin
This could be good
this is the most DEADPAN Wonka Ive ever seen hahahaha
Fingers crossed this is good
Was that MR MOSBEY  107
Bruh Hollywood really running out of ideas
It feels like a Disney production Its got a lot of diversity in it
Idk about the acting of the kid playing Willy but Ill eventually watch it
THIS IS ABSOLUTELY TRASH AND AN INSULT THE ORIGINAL
I totally want to use that Hugh Grant line on my boss too late Ive started dancing now and once weve started we cant stop Bah ha ha ha  I will edit this comment and let everyone know if I get fired AND arrested LOL
YOOO THIS LOOKS EPIC
timothee chalamet was BORN for this role for some reason i thought he was willy wonka in another movie of charlie in the chocolate factory but like in the way that ive just already seen him as willy wonka but i havent seen the movie yknow
He reminds me of the Artful Dodger
NANIIIIII
Noooooo
Oh my god this looks so freaking amazing I am not a fan of the movie but this is making super excited
Cringe
i dont understand but old is always gold 
As much as people liked Gene Hilder I feel like theres potential to make this into a really good trilogy Start here with Wonka then Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a sequel then a movie about the factory after Charlie took over to close it off
A movie about child molester pedophilia Should have cast Michael Jacksonoh yeah dead
Timothee as Willy Wonka is something I never imagined but its a nice change of pace
What a wonka 
"I cannot expressed the level of FRICKEN HYPED I AM FOR THIS 
"
Is that the dude who always memes on the piano Yoooo
Im not sure that Timothee Chalamet is best for this role He almost too introverted his movements arent eccentric enough and his voice lacks inflection wonder and excitement I think the music could also be better but I cant put a pin on it
Not timotheee chalemeeetr
It looks good but we dont need another Willy Wonka We certainly didnt need the dreadful version with Johnny Depp Willie Wonka is Gene Wilder and always will be
Stop
"I spy with my little eye someone whom we all love










MR BEAN 

Tho





Why is
Rowan Atkinson a priest now 




RUN AWAY "
cuteness overload
Made by committee film No thanks
"I think Tomothe is not a good fit for this movie He looks too cute for that 
Willie I think is more misterious funny and serious at the same time with a lot of imagination Anyway I will watch it"
Of course theres a black girl
Nothing original anymore
Im going to watch this trailer a lot
Um tthe last one before this si way better this is ewww
We need the Coraline movie from the story  that would be a box office
Paul muaddib in his coma
YEAH NO he is no Wonka he cant even sound convincing  his acting is really poor for this role
You cant tell me that Wonka was a muggle He was totally a wizard Where are my HP fans
SO EXCITED
Hmm
Another woke movie
Aku akan menunggu  WOOOONNNKKKAAAA  Layan makan coklat 
I trust the creators but Im still not convinced on Timotee Chalamet as Willy Wonka
Cmoooon not this punk
Bahaha WarnerBros paying for the boosts and the likes because you know this looks like utter garbage
Wrong actor to play Willy he should be English not American
Am I the only one that finds it odd that there is not one bad comment Allow me the movie looks woke and I will not be seeing it
These remakes just get worse and worse
Hugh Grant will be the best part of this movie Im not feeling Chalamet as Wonka though
This is definitely the prequel to the Gene Wilder version
this could have been charlie day
I love that moment in the trailer where Willy became Wonka and said Its wonking time
So whats next A remake of gone with the Wind A Hondo remake A Wild Bunch remake
Naahhh
Looks absolutely atrocious
Why does he sound like Foghorn Leghorn 019
Omg Keygan as the sarcastic cop was hilarious to see
slay
2023 movies are going to be so fun and iconic its giving  the world is healing again but in a better way nostalgia in a modern way
I wish Tim Burten would make a Willy Wonka like story about EL CHAPO 
Jesuslet the 1rst movie in PEACE omg go do something DIFFERENT
Another Wonka movie  That is enough on that topic  That is one creepy actor   No thanks
did anyone spot the character who was just inserted for no real good reason  serves nothing to telling the story of wonka from the original
Im going to skip it  Been there done that
trash i preffer johnny deep one
Can we please stop doing remakes of Charlie and the chocolate factory The first movie was perfect we didnt need any more
Y did they switch the actor
Barbie oppenheimer napoleon now this cinema is being saved
too many black people
Does this mean theyre finally gonna bring back the real life Wonka Bars
Not enough black people 
""
Looks weird nothing like the original
Not sold on wonka
Meh
This is so good Timothee is so versatile and that Oompa Loompa to be Hugh Grants is so cute  I cant wait to see this
noooooo wheres the ungrateful kidss
Wow This looks so meh
Quote from a tumblr post about wonka where is the madness behind his eyes The malice The complete disregard for the laws of mankind and decency This man makes me fear that Ill be shoved into a taffy machine at the slightest provocation
no raceswapping no woke things what a perfect movie
EPIC THIS FIRE
Awesome loved it Cant wait
he would make a perfect hobbit
they literally butchered the saying at 011 its strike that reverse it
Why Hasnt this movie been done to death
I will not be watching the new woke PC travesty of one of my favorite stories ever It looks horrendous No
Looks pretty garbage Not much of a surprise though
i cant take this kid playing wonka seriously hes like 13
Rowan Atkinson saying RUN AWAYYY got me 
Sorry but Johnny depp is irreplaceable 
Hahaanother 1
im very happy there is rowan atkinson in the movie i just miss him
I thought it would be cringe but it looks kinda fun
I have some doubts but I am excited all the same
Hollywood has wonked its last Willy
I see Rowan Atkinson Thats enough for me I will watch this
CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS ON BIOSKOP ASAP
no Soul
why
Well was terrible
Great no remake Would watch
Nice Ollaah 
Damn they even have michael keagan as a police
Theyll NEVER EVER EVER SURPASS GENE WILDER The 1 and only WONKA
Im always surprised how WB burns their money and just dont care about it total insanity
This movie is going to be worse than the other Wonkas Just worse bad and another money grab 010 not going to watch
another one
Ive been waiting for this film since it was announced Timothy challamate looks just like willy Wonka 
Quentin Tarentino was right we live in an era of creativity bankruptcy There is no exciting movie anymore all they do is recycling old ideas or radaptons old movies that dont need to
mr bean
Cringe
Its very stupid
Judging by the design of the Oompa Loompa Id guess this movie is supposed to be in the same universe as the 1970s movie Or maybe its just a nod Chalamet dont come close to having the same mysterious charisma as Gene Wilder though
How dumbhe does not make a good Willy Wonka
oh god they couldve picked a worst actor
R u fkn kidding me dont ruin my memory of Johnny depp willy wonka
Wesley wizard wheezes
The producers of HARRY POTTER
The MATRIX is real 
Nice to see Mr Bean
who up wonking their willy rn
mans going after big chocolate
Is this shot in Milan at the Galleria mall Seems like so or at least inspired by it
Hollywood are stealing ideas from dead men again and putting out work that the original artist would never want to be associated with
""
Hmmidk This trailer lacks a flavor of darkness to me
Timmy everywhere like it great
Diversity The Chocolate Movie looks absolutely dreadful
Old Willy Wonka
I cant wait to pirate this movie this Christmas
Although I love they chose Timothe Chalamet to play Willy Wonka Im going to miss the crazy  almost psycho stares Johnny Depp made when he played Wonka
No dont let it be another kids movie
WOWWWWW
I would rather watch movie about Charlie becoming head of Wonkas factory
Knp jhonny depp terlalu melekat pada karakter ini dan timothy bagiku wajahnya terlalu kalem
I have zero interest in this and that is upsetting
but why would they steer away so much from the Wonka I know that is the one played by jony deppI feel jonys wonka had a completely different personality which we all loved and he hated kids let alone interacting with so many people
I am genuinely so happy that they are not just rehashing the old story and are giving us something different TC looks in amazing form as ever
"Cant wait to see at 142 that Rowan Atkinson continues to act in the movie
Edit Yes of course that guy is totally look like Mr Bean"
Im hoping charlie replace willy wonka n inherited willy wonkas crazy mind attitude n ideas
I got hunger game songbird and snake vibe
we evne got rowan atkinson this better be good
A nice christmas movie to watch with the family
""
 
So basically he invented chocolate with drugs on it
I need jdepps thoughts on this
I hate Timothe for some reason He is soo punchable So no thanks D
Looks pretty booooring
WTF is this what a description for some cash
why do i keep noticing race based qouta hiring its so freaking weird its like they made sure to have atleast 1 but not more than 1 black person as a cop or 2nd mc etc  if your  going to hire black people dont single out one in every group just hire a random amount you can tell it was a race hire what are they going to do with the oompa loompas historicaly they were black slaves are they going to make them WHITE
Its supposed to take 45 minutes Im done in five Stick that up your everlasting gobstopper
Finally after 18 years of waiting we get another Wonka Movie
102 there he is
WHAT A AMAZING TRAILER OMG
I was watching the trailer and there was something about how the world and atmosphere of the movie and the vibe that really reminded me of the Harry Potter and then in the trailer they showed that its the same producers that made the Harry Potter movies
More like Wokea
cringe
Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson what a strange combination I have to check it out 
this is going hit
me encanta timothy
U will never be Johnny deep
This doesnt need to be a movie u already did matilda and that was bad enough
Ah yes the long awaited  movie
YESSS THE ACTOR FROM MR BEAN ROWAN ATKINSON
timmy mejor que dicaprio y dep
It turned out to be a cool film but again no one can compare with actor Johnny Depp and his scope not in films about Wonka not in the Jack Sparrow Captain movies
mi amor
casate conigo
te ao timmy
perfect
mi bebe
como lo amo
mejor que bbarbie
mi timmy lindo
shoulda been my bro joey
I need johnney depp to even this movie
Hmm I like it
Hugh Grant has a role other than simpering upper middle class twit  Interesting
Im all set
I think its pointless because no matter what the oryginal will be better
Your recap was on point You covered all the important parts
This looks like a nice film to watch
Mr bean 
TIMMYYYYYYY
was wondering when is the oompa loompas gonna show up
twink
What the actual heck is this im still in shock and just no
140 mr bean RUN AWAAAY
Ahhanother movie nobody asked for
Statistics Statistics Statistics yeahhh 
none of his mannerisms or lines gives me willy wonka vibes this is honestly a miscast gene wilder would be disgusted lmao
   
Timothe Chalamet is too cute to be playing Willy Wonka I love him but I feel he was miscast here
Awwwww I loved Johnny Depps version more He was energetic had sass and hated people lol I loved how colorful and magical the last one felt This one feels like a colorless  documentary on old people 
115 nothing to see here just a bunch of people defying the laws of gravity
All I see in every Chalamet movie is Chalamet Not saying hes a bad actor but it feels like Hollywood is shoving him down our throats as the new Di Caprio or something and I just cant
i miss johnny depp
OH MY GOD I cannot wait to watch this my papi Johnny Depp and now my baby Chalamet What a treat I love Warners bros for creating this I love Christmas movies Willi Wonka is MY MOST  FAVORITE ever
"Wow 1 o
I love Williard Wonkard "
Pay your writers and actors
Mr Wonka like a skin cyclops mobile legend 
"030 YOOOOO THEY GOT THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORYS and the fat egg man from alice and wonder land and a lot of other movies

edit and mrbean damn"
I will give it a chance cause I looks better then that creepy one
Oh my God yes I need to watch this movie I watched both the original movie and johnny Depp movie
Another of these films Uggg
I wanna see this 
Depp was more cringe than him that means he is better than him
i cant wait for this
Caillier suisse dd vevey 
bro thought he was gene wilder
Not again Ffs
cant wait for this guy to be on the battle pass
Is no one talking about how the producer of Harry Potter did this
So quiet up and listen down Nope Scratch that reverse it
ima get a lot of hate saying this but it looks trash
""
WE LOVE CHOCOLATES
Why do they make this
He Owns Little Men With Different Colored Skin With No Pay But Chocolate Just Reminding 
Oh this just looks adorable cant wait
this brings us back when movies where carried by the story telling not the cgi
Im tired of reboots and reimaginings but i do like timmy champagne so ill probably watch this
This did not need to happen
Why Why cant we make new movies with all new characters and plots and things Why do we have to take already golden classics and mess them up
Coming In Christmas
Cant act
Here we go momma chills
this looks dire
I love stories like these
"This seems more interesting than I thought it would turn out

Whilst I dont feel too much in a hurry to watch this movie I think this is not that bad"
will the dentist have a part in this movie
"I will never like this movie without Johnny depp 
I feel like hes the only one to play Willy wonka "
Hugh Grant stole this movie  Im going to watch this one in the theater for sure 
I hope we get to see johnny Depp as cameo or should have cast him
""
""
My favorite childhood story and one of my favorite actors  Ill definitely see this opening weekend
This film might be what the Great Showman tried to be in tone Less their absolute bangers
I like how everybody talks like theyre in a Willy Wonka movie
why does mans look like lil mabu
They have to push woke diversity and feminism into every movie nowadays
They keep recycling the same stories
Looks cute
People will debate about how depps version of wonka was better than timothys smh but cant wait for the film
Prequel of Charlie and the chocolate factory
How many times they gonna remake this bs
Timothee is such a great actor But seeing him portray as Willy Wonka seems so bizzare to me Its like casting Danny Devito as John Wick And you force him to look menacing skillful and deadly
You know its gonna be good when the same guy who writtendirected the Paddington movies is also working on this
This has all my favourite actors Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant Mathew Baynton its gonna be a great movie especially round chrismas
NEVER KNEW ROWAN ATKINSON WOULD BE IN THIS MOVIE 
Another soulless woke checklist
Wont be as good as the orginal but nothing is these days
"Looks like they pulled all of the fun and dry humor out and paved over it with bland jokes and boring inspirational scenes 

Please just leave Willy Wonka alone clean up the print for the original and rerelease that in theaters for a few weeks if you want You wont have to pay any actors or writers so it would fit in your budget Im sure"
Awww Im looking forward to this so much 
Why does every modern protagonist have a young black girl holding their hands though Itd be cool to see someone build an empire alone for once I mean do they now have to explain how she dies or just dissapears from the universe
Jesus another one The original is the best and will remain the best Period
"Why is side character black
Woke"
I need Jhonny deep 4that
Didnt see this coming haha
Finally an accuratesized 1971 oompaloompa
nope
But Im expecting the old oompa loompa character
Ive been a big fan of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and now after many years heres the story of Wonka  acted by my favorite actor WHAT A surprise
Take my money I wants to Watch nows
Set in America now
024 Confirmed Flash is in Wonka Its all part of the new DCU
Another forced diversity character
It doesnt look bad I like Timothee Chalemet and he seems like hes bringing a childlike sense of wonder to the character which I appreciate It just kind of makes me think about how detestable Johnny Depp was a Willy Wonka It made me think that nobody but Gene Wilder could play him Wrong Johnny Depp just gave a terrible interpretation of the character
Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa is just priceless Cant wait for Christmas
"I know people got tired but someone has to ask

Who up wonkin their willy right now"
Definitely going to watch this on Christmas
johnnys will be hard to beat my favorite movie everrrrr
Anyone else still a fan of the one with Johnny Depp Helena Carter and Christopher Lee in it
Hmmmjust not feeling it I think Ill wait and see what Jeremy Jahns says about it first His tastes are usually the same as my own so I can pretty much trust his ratings
That looks great
Whoever controls the  spice  chocolate controls the universe
Hes a good actor I guess but everything is wrong His whimsy feels so forced
this looks weird
"no creativity
reboot after reboot"
not enough token minorities
When I first heard of this movie it was during the whole Jonny depp and amber heard trial and I didnt think Id like it but its been 2 years and Im super excited
This is Mary Poppins mixed with chocolate 
this isnt even the same vibes as the OG if youre gonna make a wonka movie make the personalities right I would have preferred a horror movie of willy wonka than this ngl
kinda interesting until the blacks come in
Looks trash I dont mean to offended anyone but why do they have to have a black girl as one of the main characters They did it for that other Disney movie and now this
Hearing the classical Willy Wonka melody in orchestral sounds amazing
Looks really cool but not interested
wont be as good
Necesito verla que magnfica 
We wanted but something we should be needed in this remex
Wao Nice remix
no
Te amo timmy
Timmys Wonka looks good Hes bringing Willys character to life wonderfully thus far in this trailer
I love how he has a black sidekick Not Asian not European but African So refreshing
Heres an idea COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW
Why cant I find any DUNE jokes in the comments
Theres only 1 wonka that would be Gene Wilder Hollywood just cant help themselves money hungry as can be
Downvoted for not enough overly apparent forced diversity
How will they make this some woke BS
Fantastic chocolates  how to make them
That oompa loompa is a buck
Is there gonna be a Charlie in it
Dem Wonkas just keep getting younger and younger man he gonna be a toddler my the fifth one
Its Good but not as good JOHNNY DEPTH
"141
Mr Bean"
"I see Red Bull has competition 
Would you rather have a drink that gives you wings or chocolate that defies gravity "
Yeah you can really tell the producers of Harry Potter made this
So sad we wont get Dr Wilbur Wonka aka count dooku in this movie
they need to just let this go and stop making wonka films not even johnny depp could make it interesting this will probably be an epic fail at the theatres sad 
We all needed this movie for willy Wonka to have his origin story
What about Johnny Depp is he forgotten
This movie has the heartbeat of what I think Roald Dahl would have imagined in his head Im delighted to see this Question why they made the other remake it was strange and confusing
"101
Did I just saw a legend "
 
WOKEA
Where is the may god have mercy on your soul Wonka vibes
I see Mr Bean I will watch the movie 
Disney vibes fr
Theres still time to change the main character lmaoooo pleaseee
Every good thing in the world Start with dreams Amazing
All forced diversity boxes being ticked again I see  
Didnt something happened as to why Wonka closed his factory and fired everyone or is that something we gonna see later
i do not believe timothy has the capacity for insanity of willy wonka i fear the character will be silly or goofy at best
is that Lil Mabu
a fresh new look at willy wonkafor entertainment purposesi will definitely see it
I searched oppenheimer trailer and Got this  nahh wonnkaheimer
This looks so terrible
OMG I WANNA WATCH THIS SO BAD 
Chalomett does not fit this part
Notice all his team on the comments
Man this new Dune film look so different
Oh again the musucals
Its a continuous of wonka the chocolate factory
Im so sorry but Willy Wonka was perfected by Johnny Depp and none other can give the same impact  sorry Timothy
Trash
uh no  charlie and the chocolate factory is my favorite movie 
I cant wait for Christmas
no thanks
where is Charlie
"so david heyman producer of harry potter
and Paul King director of paddington are both working on this movie COOL"
Chocolate prices after this
im sorry but no
wrong wonka we are looking for
I got so many goosebumps watching this trailer Cant wait for it to be out 
AM i the only one that hates when people make more modern versions on good movies
Cant wait to see Rowan Atkinson
Looks like more Hollywood garbage
Jeremy allen white should play wonka
scratch that reverse it
Mr  Bean 
I came to critique this trailer as if we needed yet another Wonka movie But I watched the trailer and OMG I want to see this now too I guess you could say it had the Willy Wonka effect on me  
Who noticed Matt Baynton from Horrible Histories
so what do we learn The 1920s were much more diverse than nowadays weird and I thought it was the other way round
 will wait for it to hit streaming service
Same mom Different Wonka As Timothy steps into Johnnys footsteps we hope to see the same mentality of crazy
sorry wonkas voice doesnt match and is not appealing for the character 
Eh
Im sure Ill get torn apart for writing anything negative so Ill just say looks like a good one
Ill get hate for this but I dont care This just looks like another soulless generic cash grab I hope it doesnt turn out that way but I feel like when they cast big name actors for smaller roles its compensating for a lackluster experience Like why cast Hugh grant as one of the Oompa Loompas
waiting
Nope Im good I loved the first one and the second with Johnny depp was amazing I personally dont think this one will be as good as the last two But maybe Ill be surprised 
Loads of familiar faces Looks like a unique adaptation of Roald Dahls Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Most of Paddingtons cast is here as it is also directed by the same director Thanks for sharing  Greetings from London
The jokes feel super flat  the movie is giving major Mr Magoriums Wonder Emporium vibes but way more stale
it would be hard for someone to play willy wonka  with less charisma
I think a Wonka origin story is conceptually bad in the same way that the Oz films with James Franco were You take this mysterious eccentric somewhat morally ambiguous character and ruin them with a relatable origin bland love interest and a stockstandard herovillian dynamic Then of course most importantly you overexplain all the little things people remember from the most famous version of the character The perfect recipe for a mid movie that well all forget even happened
So this is a different take wonka interesting
I dont want to be here anymore
0010 LET HIM COOK HIS SPECIAL CHOCO
OMG Timmy is perfect for this role
Horrible
This looks ok
Is this prequel to Charlie and The Chocolate Factory 2005 or the overrated Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory 1971
This is going to touch me in ways unimaginable to mankind
To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Johnny depp tribute willy wonka
fascinated
thankgod mr wonka is not black 
Looks boring
Wanka factory a startup with other giants now
Gonna watch that only for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
"Wrote this as a fan

In a land of sweets and chocolate delight
There lived a man a whimsical sight
His name was Willy Wonka oh so grand
With candy creations he ruled the land

With a top hat and a quirky grin
He had a factory where fun would begin
Golden tickets a chance so rare
To enter his world beyond compare

OompaLoompas singing with glee
They danced and laughed as happy as can be
Inventing candies strange and bizarre
From everlasting gobstoppers to fizzy lifting spar

But beware my friend for mischief awaits
In the Chocolate Room where the river undulates
With chocolate waterfalls tempting and sweet
You might just end up with sticky feet

Augustus Gloop oh what a sight
Fell into the river a chocolatey plight
Violet Beauregarde she chewed too much gum
And turned into a blueberry oh what fun

Veruca Salt a girl so spoiled
Fell down a chute her tantrums foiled
And Mike Teavee oh what a shock
He shrunk himself down like a ticktocking clock

Through trials and lessons we all learned
That greed and gluttony can be spurned
Willy Wonka taught us with laughter and cheer
To find joy in life and hold those we hold dear

So raise your candy bars and give a cheer
For Willy Wonka the confectionery pioneer
His factorys magic will forever endure
In our hearts and memories sweet and pure"
Looks like trash to me I wont be watching it ever
Is that Mr Bean at 102 
When i saw there was a new willy wonka movie i did an eye roll but then i saw the trailer and i am so excited
Looks good
This trailer plays like a parody of every biopic ever made
You know this movie is gonna be great when the people who made the Harry Potter movies and the paddington movies make it
who let bro cook
They retell Willy Wonka more than they retell SpiderMans origin story
Cant waitttt
Cant wait 
See Im something of a magician inventer chocolate maker so quiet up an listen down no scratch that reverse it I love that 
MR BEAN
Im so exited
Cant wait Getting every second goosebumps thinking of this
I recently got my first job and I think Im going to spend my money to watch this movie because it looks amazing
OMG I CANT WAIT
Johnny Deep was too strong for being Willy Wonka before But I know Timothee would be a great Willy Wonka Gonna watch this movie
They got the Hugh just right for the Umpa Loopas orange
Main actor makes me cringe
The likes to dislike is 357 371  59 428
Who likes cats
A third wonka movie It better not be too much for people to handle
no es por hate pero el willy wonka de jhonny deep es horrible no me provoco NADaa la historia parece una burla de la original creo que timothee y gere son los unicos wonkas no el abusador
I absolutely love when the movie shows the words Discover How Willy Became Wonka and how Wonka is this beautiful looking title Im already gonna love this movie
los que conocemos a timothe REALMENTE sabemos que nacio para ser willy wonka mark my words
im a fan of wonka loving this
loving this already
Hes such a  wonker 
Im glad in this film they took a different approach to the story and instead of having him hand out golden tickets like in the first two movies its more about Wonkas backstroy
Old is always better
My mind is unable to accept anyone other than Johnny depp as willy wonka
is this a seaquel to 2005 Charlie And the choclade factory becuace its Made by village roadshow pictures
Tui th y ri 
Jonny Depp  was my Wonka
153 I love how much this looks like Gene Wilder the original Willy Wonka
What happens when a film is shot for the sake of racial diversity
Timothe Chalamet got sick multiple times during production due to how much chocolate and candy he had to eat  IMb
Looks fun
Too early We already got a remake
So we all already have accepted the fact that by the end of the film this happy go lucky kid will turn into a lonely misanthrope who likes to torture children
idc what anyone says hes prefect for this role
The prequel of Johnny Depps Wonka
Movie looks trash
Welp This sure is a thing thats happening  Not exactly feeling excited but definitely want to go watch Charlie and The Chocolate Factory again Whether it be marvel movies Pixar animations or any generic cheap jump scare horror film I dont know what it is or maybe its just how trailers are made but they all feel the same  Maybe Im becoming more cynical with age
omg
they have no movie idea i think it will be not bad but we dont need this movie we watch the same one lol i can help of an movie idea
Only thing distracting me and this is a knit pick this is meant to be a prequel to gene wilders wonka but he had blue eyes not brown like I said just a knit pick
Prequel Wonka
cringe x100
He acting like lead male role in a high school drama production thats already been in 4 situationships with freshmen this term
I am perfectly willing to accept Hugh Grant may be the best cinematic version I have seen of an Oompa Loompa
Wait they really remake Willy Wonko
113 I can tell this banana orc will be my favorite character
Why thy didnt cast Johnny Depp
I prefer Micheal Scott
When i scrolled past this I was 100 sure it was fake and didnt pay it no mine My thumb accidentally clicked it Lets just say that might of been the greatest accident in recent memory
More woke garbage
I think people writing Timothee Chalamet off immediately are wrong to do so I honestly think hell do a good job and add his own spin to the character
Ill watch it in cinemas for sure
as long I saw rowan atkinson count me in
Hugh Grant is apparently going through a phase of accepting completely unhinged casting choices first he plays Forge in the DD movie and now hes playing an Oompah Loompa
Oh god the cringe
I love this
Omg i gotta kuuum
they should not call this movie willy wonka what gargabe
Looks greatuntil some idiot complains real little people werent used  Hopefully everyone can just enjoy a good movie for what it is
Willy 
It does not match please redo
I can sense the woke messaging already Here comes another Dud
REAL
L  johnny depp is the best one
The last kiss  blown by that woman sealed everything for me about this film I love it
Feels like they use Timothee just because he is famous but if the writing is good can still be a hit D
Wonka going Woke
I would love to watch that Wonka movie I love the Gene Wilder  Johnny Depp versions and i used to watch those 2
timothee is not who i expected for this but it works
mn meu marido est em um filme E ELE EST SORRINDO SCRR
Why does this mf look like Daniel Thrasher
This doesnt just look BAD it looks so bad that I have come back to watch the trailer several times over the past several days LOL  About 100 views on the view count are mine
Idk dont hate it but not exited Just wait till it comes out
oh god really
And because shes black and hes white that makes it more special for the audience
I like old movies better but it looks good 
Eh
       
Shoudlve got daniel radcliffe
I dont think this timothy is not suitable for wonky character
You get it Theyre selfaware So it it must be funny
WW
Definitely watching
wow from the director of Paddington this for sure will be heartwarming
Um no just cringe on many levels Not even close to good The acting is weak and the so called comedic part is tryhard Gonna be a No for me
Director of Paddington and producer of Harry Potter Im so excited about this Having a heartwarming movie come to theaters is so fantastic Its something we havent had in a while
No
Oh this is going to be a disaster  Gene Wilder is irreplaceable
Its just hard to accept a Wonka who isnt Johnny
Willy Wonka 
SoundOfFreedom
"He kindof looks like he wants your kids so lock the factory up 




"
150 the woman looks so familiar but i dont really know where i saw her And since when Timothy Chalamet is so damn fine 
Nope
Every good thing in this world started with a dream That quote itself I cant wait to see that movie Im sure is going to become a classic
Too many token people of color Pass
the only thing im weary about with this is the obvious use of a lot of CGI i just think practical effects create such a gorgeous and special film when they are able to be used and add a lot of soul to a project Hopefully the effects are used sparingly when able and i feel like the cast and plot will be fun lovely and lighthearted enough that I wont mind too much either way I see a lot of criticism about Timmy being cast as Wonka but I have literally never seen him in a role that didnt fully blow me away and stick with me Hes an extremely talented young actor and I trust him to do this character justice Overall excited to see a fun joyfilled movie around Christmas time
F off Timothee I want to watch another actor
Waiting list sih ini   mau nonton
This is my Christmas party movie for this year
AhhhhMazzzzzz ING Lol I cant wait 
Idk y but I always thought Jhonny Depp was always Mr Wonka but now I get to see the younger version of Mr Wonka from a different perspective Cant wait to watch this
It looks great but another one
No chance this is good
Chocolate is the mind killer
Omg omg omg omg omg 
"cant compare with Johnny 
seems so artificial  crazy acting vs acting crazy"
I SAW RICH FULCHER
L
im so up for this movie willi woka i seen the other film with johnny deep as jack sparrow
Timothy charlescharlemagnemane is in everything these days wtf
Timothee Chalamet  REALLY This is an underwhelming Wonka  I can think of 4 other people better fit to play willy wonka
I wanted to see jhonny depp tho else its good
Cringe
"OH LOOK another example of the total death of creativity in Hollywood and their utterly shameless greed  Cant wait til 5 years from now when we get ANOTHER even MORE watered down remake of the same story andor characters

How fundamentally repulsive no amount of good CGI or set or costume design etc is good enough to cover up what this really is "
With everything so bleak as lately this may honestly be the type of movie we all needed especially during the holidays
They should just make this new Willy Wonka apart of the harry potter franchise with the magic theyve added in this
is that mr bean on church 
im 27 years old with 2yrs old kid and im gonna watch this hahaha
""
Possibly the worst casting for a young Wonka Just looks like hes trying too hard
is this prequel combining the 1971 and 2005 versions of the chocolate factory because it looks great
Is there going to be actual truth in this version Willy Wonka going to be eating children like the actual story Trailer starts with him mimicking Baphomet
Wonderful Rowan Atkinson is the besttt 
perfect casting
perfect wonka
lo amo
It Hass to have a sad ending After all  Wonka closes the chocolate factory for decades
All I can hear is Paul Atreides so this energy is so wack 
OMG I must see this I love Timothy Chamlet 
One slight problem  what happened to the black girl between the origin story and the original that Wonka didnt put her in charge of his empire
enough with the remakes come up with some original ideas for new movies and stories  hollywood is just lazy and unoriginal
Johnny
Chalamet is definitely forcing it Usually a great actor but this is not his role
Really Another Wonka thing to give nightmares to another generation Enough with them scary little evil creatures
"Im sorry but this looks like total garbage Dont get me wrong I can tell they put A LOT of money into it and I love Chalamet and his films Beautiful Boy Dune Call Me By Your Name Bones and All but this character just doesnt fit him We need a nitty gritty Wonka horror film This is just Willy Wonka in a Harry Potter universe and its just corny AF I really wish someone would create a film closer to the ORIGINAL 1964 novel where the lines were mixed between good and evil Where the Oompa Loompas were actually slaves who were kidnapped from their village and put to work by a maniacal mad man named Wonka Theres just so many things that are being left out and I think the people just want a Dark Wonka film for once instead of the light hearted BS nonsense

On another note can someone please remake The Phantom Tollbooth already"
It doesnt look terrible Ill give it that
Sorry but that guy from shameless would have been a WAAAAY better actor
this looks dogshit
The Oompa Loompas in this movie looks like the ones in the original 1971 movie and not the ones in the 2005 Tim Burton movie So far this movie supposed to be a prequel and origin story of the 1971 film So far Willy Wonka was the first probably also the last human to ever stepped foot on Loompaland and the first human to ever sees an Oompa Loompa along seeing the Hornswogglers Vermicious Knids Snozzwangers and Whangdoodles as well in Loompaland and Willy Wonka is also the first human the Oompa Loompa ever saw The movie probably should have these other creatures from Loompaland Hornswogglers Vermicious Knids Snozzwangers and Whangdoodles to see what they look like
Sorry Gene Wilder did it first Can movies just stop being made
Why cant people just mke their own movies No originality
"I just wanna know if that girl is his sister or daughter maybe bff idk


Edit Also how does he wear that suit everywhere "
This looks terrible
i love timmy
They filmed this where i live and i got to meet akanson and talk to the director while they was filming They was really friendly and down to earth Cant wait to see my home town with added cgi its where the ompalompas live
Looks like a promising one IMO
please god no
Ngl this came out of nowhere
Didnt really ask for this so it better be good
I feel like each Willy Wonka movie he keeps looking younger and younger
I had zero interest in this before but the trailer is fantastic Looks good
Still nothing will ever touch the Gene Wilder classic 
Y are the wonkas progressively getting younger with each film
Yep Thats it Pack it up We have officially scraped the bottom of the barrel and busted through the bottom to start digging our own graves As if enough IP or classic films havent been raped
I love the respect to the 70s version The tim burton version just didnt hit the same
Awwww I love Hugh 
Omggggg I wanted to see an umpanlumpa 
"Nah bro thats not an Oompa Loompa thats a Napoleon Syndrome Personification 

Also I expected this to be based off of the Netflix movie glad to see its the old version this is based on"
Its just ew
Looks like more woke garbage
Looks terrible
150 Isnt that Charlies Mom
You know I was worried at first it looked like a cash grab ruining one of Roald Dahls masterpieces but now that I know the guy who made this also made paddington I think the movie is in good hands I wonder if Dahl would approve of this
I was really expecting wonk to not be white Idky
Just here to See Hugh Loompa
I cant wait 
Not crazy about Chalamet as Wonka not edgy enough for me but it still looks like a fun family movie which the world is in desperate need of plus Christmas so itll likely do very well
This looks to me like its going to be Fantastic Beasts with a bunch of Willy Wonka nostalgia perhaps a bunch of Gene Wilder quotes so we can all say Awww I remember that Ill go see it but sadly Im not hopeful
Omg I cant wait for this
Well theyre clearly following Mr Depps take on Wonka Hmmm
JK Rowlings Fantastic Treats and Where to Find Them
i like timmy but his acting in this role sounds more like him doing a parody than actual acting
Nobodys gonna look back on this Theres no good reason for an escapee giraffe what does it have to do with anything
Cringe
   
Im glad this is off of Gene Wilders Willy Wanka rather than the Johnny Depp one I like Depps plenty but nothing will beat the OG
Interesting His prestory Hmmmmmm
Roald Dahl is rolling in his grave please no Wonkaverse
this movie was so unnecessary rehashing old ideas again and again I guess its the writers strike Hollywood lacking originality once again
Thats a lot of token blacks
i think ima turn into a fan of this guy
oh hey look another movie with the fragile looking pale actor bathing in privilege he is way too boring for this role arent there other people
 so cool also as soon as i saw the lady at the end i instantly recognised her from paddington which is awesome since this movie was also made by the directors of paddington
YEESSS OMGGG I LOVE THIS MOVIE ALR
Wow the plethora of positive reviews here dont seem sketchy whatsoever 
willy winks is the literally embodiment of never let them know your next move
Who asked
I refuse to accept Timothee Chalamet as Mr wonka 
Johnny Depp reaction 
Noice always wanted too see how it started
When u think wonka u think of treats cakes and candy
bullsnitch without depp can never top
Any thing have Harry Potter I will watch it 
TIMMMY 
Im pretty sure someone working for the film industrys betted on the 2023 movie flop number
Cant replace Jonny depp
I think they mixed this with harry potter
Im not excited about this trailer
Im sure we will learn that the real hero of this story is the little girl she will probably be credited for having discovered and invented chocolate and if it wasnt for her then Wonka never would have succeeded at anything in life You know keeping with the theme of realism in 2023
He is the Willy Wonka we didnt know we needed He is perfect for this 
Hes trying too hard to be crazy The reason Gene was so good at his character was because he was a little bit off in real life These actors will never be able to do what he did not even Johnny Depp It also seems a bit cheesy and disney kidlike so that might actually make it a success for this generation of children but itd fail in the generation of the 70s when children enjoyed real filmmaking not whatever this is
   
This looks so cute I cant wait to see it
Huh thats an awful amount of African Britons in 1950s United Kingdom They really trying to meet that WEF quota arent they
will take my kids to watch
Wow didnt know there was gonna be a Wonka in 2023
I have high hopes major fan of the original with Gene Wilder  Johnny Depps was not as good but still very watchable and more enjoyable if you dont try to compare to the original  This one looks like a nice reimagining of the story so Im excited to see it with my  two boys
I went back to the happy old days when I watched TV with my family on a snowy weekend when I was a kid I look forward to the day when I will watch this movie and be happy 3
One of my favourite movieexcited for th part 2 of willy wonka
So damn tired of nepo babies
It actually looks like a fun and wholesome movie Looking forward to it 
Its not even a competition  Johnny Depp will always be the best Willy Wonka 
Just imagine a young Jim Carrey as Willy Wonka  that would be legendary
Looks 
Ol Timothy seems a little stiff in this trailer
"i think he loses his friend the girl thats seen with him and thats why in the other
movies hes really cold and stuff"
Wow this actually looks like a Movie
I suppose each generation a have a different concept of Willy Wonka
Watching this for Timothee Chalamet
they got lore now
Im gonna go get a crunch bar Im in the mode for chocolate
This better bring back the Wonka brand
Yuck Christmas
Is this version of WW LBQTQXYZ approved
This looks shite
Cant wait
The movie seems fun not sure about Timoth Chalamet as Willy Wonka tho Ill judge when the movie comes out
this looks sooo amazing
Lol We have already watched the OG classic Truly movie industry has fallen globally Hardly any new movies Nowadays they directors just think about making money Earlier there were superb movies but in last couple of years theres hardly any good movie globally
Yeah Wonka Movie Trailer is nice
Why does it so und like a nct song  
It looks too much like the Tim Burton film
Already the canon is off He publicly displays chocolate that makes people float but in the original they are shocked by things of that nature that happen in the factory No one remembers it happening from before Here we go I guess
Should of got Nick Cage to do this role
Why did I read Wonka as Wakanda
Oh wow how original
Dark White N U T T Y Absolutely insane I like my chocolate nutty too
""
I came ready to hate but this looks really good 
I feel like Johnny Depp could have made this movie great Lets see what this guy has to offer
please dont ruin my childhood
Wow This looks TERRIBLE I didnt want to finish the trailer RIP Gene Wilder
This looks like when Paddington meets The Greatest Showman and the two have a baby
What a joke I saw the first movie and dont need another rehashing of the same What happened to new content Fck warner bros
the chocolate they depict milk chocolate is an anachronism and would not have existed at the time this film is set It totally ruins the immersion
i think movies are done there arent gonna be any new good ones are there 
No scratch that Reverse it 
Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka is perfect
Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka looks perfect
Give this a chance guys Im gen x so grew up with the ultimate wonka Gene Wilder Didnt acknowledge the jonny Depp version This may be good The guy playing wonka is a cool dude
"Looks bad
Not showing this to my children"
Already interested
Daniel looking real good as Willy Wonka
se ve increible ya quiero verlo
Daniel Thrasher dropping a bomb rn I cannot believe he managed to keep his acting career a secret from us for so long
Came for the Thrasher looking guy
Dang I didnt know Daniel was also an actor Phenomenal job Thrasher dear
I cant believe this is what kids are getting for their movies nowadays
I already like it
Was mildly interested until the words Harry Potter came up in association with this and then Huge Grantbig pass thanks
This is going to be a great movie
i thought this was gonna be another unnecessary origin story but this actually feels magical idk how to explain it but it gives me the same vibes as some of ny childhood movies corny and happygolucky script yet still good
Is it just me or Timothe Chalamet isnt a good fit to be Willy wonka Seems not weird boring
220 nightmare fuel pure nightmare fuel 
Why cant they leave wonka alone 
040 daydreaming not allowed
This looks so bad
I just cant stop seeing Charlie in Tim waaay more then I see Wonka
Im out I cant take these things replacing what was once my childhood imagination I used to daydream about what early Han Solo would be like how Luke spent the rest of his days I used to have live action visuals imagined for Disney classics I dont want to be a bitter old man but here I am My soul would be more colorful if I would have avoided all these remakes and origin stories and unimaginative sequels and maintained the cannon that was my childhood imagination These may create a story but they take away the infinite possibilities of everyones unique imagination The lights have gone out permanently on billions of imagined storylines replaced by a forced formulaic reality I want to wake up in 98 when sequels could flop and the industry took risks because the data wasnt there yet to force constraints on creative freedom
No the 1st and 2nd one will do
He is talking to children and trying to impress them as a magician People are dumb fk who are criticising his acting
I reckon Timotei fans are going to cry and not in a good way
The world of films has just completely changed
And then one of the employees betrayed him and he fired ALL OF EM
looks very good cant wait
How Willy wonked
When are you guys going to stop using the person of color side kick
cant wait to get lost in this
There definitely wasnt this many black folk in London 1900 the woke brigade strikes again
yeahno
OMG IM ON FIRE
They put a black person in it
Ahhh so cozy
Timothy is struggling to sell these lines Little expression
I prefer the original looks ok
more woke rubbish to me
so this willy wonka was a prequel of Johnny Depps Charlie of Chocolate factory or  nah
Damn no one asked for this but were getting it blahhhh
I cannot see him as willy wonka there was one and I loved and this is not it 
LEZGO DUDE SO EXCITED FOR THIS
I cant wait to see this 
Timothy for wonka is a bad cast hes not very good at playing that character
Hes Willy Wonka not the Madhatter 
Is this a musical Hoping not
Was that ROWAN ATKINSON okay let me in
Wow I love the classic kind of movies Cant wait to see it 
Wait im not catching up Is this a rewrite version of willy wonka the one with dentist father orrr is this a story about that broke kid that ended up taking after the choc business
 esse tipo de filme q gosto de ver  ao emoo mistrio roupas antigas magia um mundo mgico q n existe eu Sandra amo isso 
Its la POV of Willie Wonka same goes with Malefiscent
I dont like Chocolate 
Gene Wilder would turn in his grave
Timothee chalamett was created to play wonka
Nothing can beat classic movie 
135 t h e  w a l l s  a r e  s h i t t i n g
its been a long time since we have this kind of movie and im all for it
"This looks amazing
Im gonna give the guy a chance to flesh out his version of Willy Wonka The settings looks great the world looks like a lot of fun and I really cant wait to see more of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Im excited for this one"
Is there no originality left in Hollywood  Ugh think Ill spend my ticket money on a good steak and cook at home
Timothee as Wonka is perfect casting
 The whole world is set up to show consequences for doing wrong All have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God We all must be willing to turn from sin and believe and follow Jesus for forgiveness 1st John 217 He who does the will of God abides for eternity Thats letting Jesus live His life in and through us His children by knowing and obeying the Word of God  nkjv
Why do this why why why
Should have gotten that Jeremy Allen White dude lol
I am gonna miss Johnny depp
"Its the REMAKE no one ask for kids


If not Why would people watch it"
"Love warner brothers but why why why this is the movie no one asked for

Best part 226"
MATTHEWWWWWWWWWWW
GREEDY CEOS    Do NOT go and see the summer movie big box office hits this summer   Send them a message  PAY what people need to live on 
"My predictions

1 Well see a young Grandpa Joe

2 One of the candy cartel is Slugworth"
Nice  I cant wait
Ive been waiting so long for this preview Now the movie in 5 months YAY
I already know theres gonna be a millon haters just because its a new movie slightly a reboot
I thought this was another reboot again but i guess its not
""
His mama is the same mama as the boy in the Depp version
This looks horrible
More antiwhite shite Roald Dahl would be turning in his grave
I feel Paddington vibes Love the style And the way Jim Carter says chocolate is just magical
This looks dreadful
So its a Willy Wonka origin story I guess that means no Charlie or no Johnny Depp
Hope we get to see Charlies grandfather as a young worker
Chocolate sales after this 
"Yo who wonking up they willy

scratch that reverse its

Willy they up working who yo"
Im interested in this movie Wonka
lots of people are saying that it is cringe but that is literally the vibe of willy wonka
Does it include a Hostel TakeOver by Kraft 
Dear God why  Is there nothing Hollywood will not destroy 
Looks boring
Did we not learn anything from Tim Burton
finally a biopic of lil joel
Im so excited for this Not long read the 2 wonka books with my daughter so to have a prequel that actually looks promising is great Will definitely be having a family trip to the cinema
I love how the actor of willy wonka has been gettinh hotter with each new film
2023 woke level 100
I saw this the other day and now I desperately want someone to make a parody trailer matching this audio with footage from Dune
My two young children LOVE Charlie and the chocolate factory Johnny Depp Version I know they will be thrilled when this comes to theaters and comes out on ones birthday How wonderful And HughGrant as a oompah Loompa 
Cool
Im watching this because of MrBean 
meh
Honestly this seems nice 
Cant wait to watch this movie im excited
Did they learn nothing from the 2nd movie You cannot improve on the ordinal Just leave it alone What are you even doing
It looks like this movie has nothing in common with the other movies besides chocolate and an original umpa lumpa It just doesnt give me Willy Wonka Vibes But it could still be its own good movie
Still 6 months to go to the theater 
whys he got an American accent the purple bumbandit
This is gonna be a terrible movie
Who was asking for this movie because I will rather have snowpiercer be canon then this
011 scratch that bring it back shook shook
WILL it be Pg13
A black girl in a movie about chocolate Thats offensive  
Woke
Willy Wonka ko baddhappan ka seedhi Chadhte dekha nahi jatauss chocolatier ko hame mitana haigoli nahi maarenge sale ko
about to be my comfort movie
yes not a remake woke stuff
Youll never beat the original film
IS THAT ONCELER REFERENCE
""
Eh prefer the johnny Depp one
"Hugh Grant Timothe Chalamet director of Paddington producer of Harry Potter and Mister Bean actor
Omg this is gonna be so good Im so excited what "
This is a prequal omg 
I dont get it why they showed us Charlies mother and Wonka said mom Is it a story of how Charlie became new wonka
ohhh
I just dont think tim chalamet fits into his characters
Gonna guess this one will be a CGI fest with rushed plot too much music 0 character development with a dash of token characters that feel forced and dont fit into the overall storyline
Was that Mr bean 
Excuse me omg
I honestly wouldnt mind watching a new Willy Wonka Movie Cant wait for it to come out
Barely 20 seconds in and you have the black girl with the afro lol more woke nonsense
                           
Woke bs
not sure
This is missing the point of Wonka Lol hes not a superhero why are they giving him magic He was eccentric like Howard Hughs not superman lol
Seems good but not a fan of musicals but might enjoy it idk Has loads of good actors in it
Im confused is Charlie a black girl now
030 horrible histories icon mathew baynton is here this movie is going to be amazing
Pass on the diversity hires
These sorts of films arent usually my thing but Wonka looks great
Screammm Oh my gosh TC as a young Wonka YES And Hugh Grant as an oompa loompaI cant wait
Omg So beautiful  
Timothy chalamalabingbong
Why are they so determined to wash all colour and life out of everything these days
TIMOTHE WILLY WONKA CHALAMET
Trash willy Wonka His tone his voice hes flow is off
this is more better then johnny depp
"From the directors of Paddington
Are you sure you want to admit that"
johney depp is the best wonka and no one will be like him but dont let the latest wonka see this comment because it would be mean
WILLY WONKA AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS THE WORST MOVIE TO EXIST CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY IS THE BEST
"If we dont get a scene of Wonka in the chocolate room pipe room in the factory Im gonna lose it

Or even better a scene with all the rooms Even a nod to Grandpa Joe as a helper in the factory would be absolutely awesome




And PLEASE the post credit scene be the five children PLEASE




And come on film Wonka didnt have a mother Only a father who he had tension with I would have loved a movie that was just an add on to all the flashback scenes we got in the 2005 movie"
"More heartwarming than the kids being grotesquely transformed or traumatized  I like a more intense Willy but ill give a try Also I need at least 4 oompa loopa songs to be satisfied tbh 
Augustus Gloop went so hard "
Yay Willy wonka and the chocolate factory 3the movie has came out
Bro is Timothy actually doing something entertaining
how different it is from the storyline of charlie and the chocolate factory
I will go to the cinema cause Hugh Grant
chocolate with spice
the chocolate cartel
"Better not cast little people as Oompa Loompas in case that offends So lets cast ablebodied actors and deny little people the work 
Very progressive"
peak cast keegan michael key mr bean and the guy from horrible history
What They just did a remake with Depp
mr bean
This looks terrible
Ive been so excited when I heard about this the trailer just gets me more pumped
Having watched the original Gene Wilder version and the Johnny Depp version ill be looking forward to this If its as good as the trailer itll be unreal
Cant believe people are excited to see a rerun of a movie already made  Hollywood will be fully run out of ideas by 2050 and be defunct
Tim is the only person on earth who can play Wonkas character after the great legend Johnny Depp
A good Mr Bean Movie
Oooo yaaay i loved johnny depp but this looks so good 
I am sold 
150 Hold on is that Mrs Browns
140 Rowand Atkinson Runnig
i volunteer to be an oompa loompa
whos writing movies these days like really lightbulb above his head turns on when he has an idea was that meant to be cleaver It all seams so cheap Like and intern wrote it The oompa loompa saved the whole trailer
No one like Johnny Depp
""
Bad casting
Lets hope the Diversity hires dont ruin it
I  when he said here we go mama
But didnt he meet the oompa loompas in a Jungle
Wish we would get a dark willy Wonka and have him as a serial killer who kills bad kids
umm
""
What a bunch of 
why does his acting looks kinda underwhelming and lack of energy
noooo the hair is not the sameeee
Why rehash the same story Move on for F sake Is anything originial these days everything is just tacky
Glad to see all the diversity hires getting roles  whatever would they do without all the DEI to support them
i saw this and thought ew but decided to put my thoughts away and watch this trailer with an open mind anyway i noticed that i hate timothees delivery for his lines it doesnt seem authentic
I see robert atkinson and thats it I need to watch this 
Looks awful nothing screams Willy Wonka
timothe chalamet omoooo
Huh interesting  isnt there already like two other movies of this Aint complaining though
If The Lorax ever gets a live adaptation I think Timothee Chalamet would fit as the Onceler
Gosh the Oompa Loompa is funny 
Hold on this actually looks amazing
I am sorry but Timothy Chalamet is trying WAY to hard to be whimsey and replicate Gene Wilder
"This looks pretty interesting and more true to the books but with creative differences or so But watching this side of Timothy act I instantly saw one thing after this performance that I hate to change the subject  This dude could definitely play a Kid Loki for later Marvel movies 1000 Hes got the acting chops timing and also range If not only that The similarities between actors casted as Loki through movies compare on a variety of levels including the playfulness but seriousness of a misunderstood character who comes to rise to glory Dune Loki Willy Wonka and other roles in comparison see an anti hero OR more of a misunderstood character develop with flaws but to change overtime and become almost the opposite Like the original Willy Wonka where Gene Wilder seems SO energetic and is exhausted  Being even a LokiSilvie character from their show ends up alone and going into more with a second season  along with other similarities I would love to see it happen

The kid who played in Loki S1 was too young to be the same as actors playing around the same age for younger avengers "
""
I love how they harmonized reprised the in the world of pure imagination in 130
Looks great
Brown wash
Come with me and youll see
I hope they include his traumatizing dentist father and how he was forbidden to eat chocolate from the first movie
My Mr Depp Wonka will forever be my Wonka Charlie and the Choc factory is my favorite holiday movie I watch it every christmas
its nice to see a willy wonka origin story instead of a remake with the kids
WANKA
Mr Bean too
timyyyyyyy
Bro Rowan Atkinson is in the flim
Yep With Paddington director plus Rowan Atkinson running and Hugh Grant dancing Im in
booOOOOOOoooo lol
Kilt it
Why is Hollywood so obsessed with timothe and tom holland 
You cannot take Johnny Depp place  Know your place
I never thought Id see the legendary Hugh Grant as a freaking Oompa Loompa but here we are
Crud Woke Agenda As usual Skip
when is it coming out
""
Looks real good
Mr bean is in here  142  102
So far I rate it a710
Haha Hugh Grant looks like Lord Farquaad from Shrek Its awkward yet cool and stupid A surprise and looks so out of touch  I do love Timothee to me hes my Bae  And Rowan Atkinson yelling Run Away is just too funny When this first was talked about years ago Im like I dont get it another Willy Wonka movie and one thats a prequel to the original Gene Wilder  Ok well we will have to see I think landing a role Tim could do better I wish he was my Spiderman or Nightwing
I CANT WAIT 
L chocolate people
This is cool I liked seeing some familiar faces like Key Bean and that guy from Suite Life of Zack and Cody I also like Timothy Chalamet for this role and the sense of wonder this movie gives
Looks like its gonna be a classic
I generally dont like musicals but do enjoy the other Willy Wonka movies but the scene at the end with the Oompa Loompa genuinely made me chuckle and now I kinda want to see it
"Up the airy mountain
Down the rushy glen
We darent go ahunting
For fear of little men"
Mmm being honest it looks like a project based off spark notes The actors are terrific but everything about it seems apart from the essence of the story I loved the book the play and the original film everything since has fallen short for the child within me who fell in love with the story
This look  mediocre
Timothee Chalamet in a musical movie is something I do not expect
Nice
He looks like his everyday self but with a funny hat on
I THOUGHT THAT WAS DANIEL THRASHER 
Wtf is this
Who up wonkin they willy rn
This movie looks terrible Gene Wilder is the only person we ever need for Wonka When he said Quiet up and listen down no strike that reverse it I was physically sad It sounds like hes just reading the script with no emotion or anything like that I probably wont be watching this movie simply from the terrible trailer quality
For another wonka movie this better be good
I cant be the only thinking the looks like a fantastic beasts movie
Why is there a mixture of English accents and American accents Isnt this an English story
I was waiting for the Oompa loompas
Ehhh I prefer Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka he gives me goosebumps
Agin Aggggh
This looks similar to Fantastic Beasts
wtf is Paul Atredies looking to make the first spice infused chocolate bar
I dont know how to feel about this I think I hate it
Listen if the director of Paddington is involved its going to be awesome Paddington 2 is the rare sequel along with Toy Story that is actually better than the first Its a masterpiece If this is even a fraction the movie Paddington 2 was we are all in for a treat
MR bean
Is he the Kingpin
Seeing rowan atkinson made me wanna watch this move
I see a lot of wokeism coming through his film
So is this a prequel to the 71 version or the Johnny depp version
The best thing about this is Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Otherwise this is trash
I just wish the chocolate cartel was a little more inclusive and diverse
casting instructions make it diverse
This looks like yet another flop inbound
So this trailer is proving my theory that Willy Wonka is actually in a mental institution and every movie hes in is just a fantasy in his head
It looks good without timothee chalat or whatever his name is
i dont timmy is right for this role
why couldnt there be a movie with charlie leading the factory 
107 why does that man look like a failed art student
Yay leave it to the trailer to basically show us 955  of the movies like theres no surprise anymore This is willy wonka origin and how his chocolate factory came to be so the ommpa lumpa should be a big grand reveal but nope lets just show it
yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
I mean it looks fine Not gonna be remembered like the original or even the Johnny Depp version I just think its sad we dont make movies for the sake of making them anymore theres always just a financial motivation and nothing else
Anyone but Timothe Chalamet
Wonka doesnt need his remakethe johnny depp version already perfect
A Willy Wonka movie that isnt a recut from what was originally a horror film color me surprised
Cool that we finally get a backstory on newt scamander i mean willy wonka
Wait isnt that rowan atkitson the priest OMG HE IS AFTER HE QUITED BEING MR BEAN HE IS BACK
Two questions Whats with the giraffe chasing And also why Hugh Grant fits so well as a oompa loompa
good to see Rowan Atkinson
Idk how i feel about this because the last one in 2006 was BAD DOG ST
Wokea not Wonka
No way its Weeny Wonka 
Love it Cant wait to see this 
This is a Remake TwT BUT AMAZING
Wonka movie without Willy Wonka
Everything looks great but him he feel flat Like it just not hit the note for me
Im not excited for this movie bc it feels like it tarnishes the legend himself  this actor isnt capturing Gene Wilder for me
no thanks
that last part had me 
Lots of blacks in this for a british story
Its cringe watching him play willy Wonka  weird casting
Wonka is quirky and kind yet firm and strong to the point of being manic I dont feel the genuine insanity I need from a Wonka but still will watch and hope Im wrong I truly wish heath ledger were still alive for this role

Fantastic Chocolates and Where To Find Them
"If this film does well I would love to see a Sequel to this film about Willy starting his chocolate factory and his workers backstabbing him and him discovering more Oompa Loompas in the 2nd act of the film and it ends with the Wonka Bars getting out back into Production

Imagine if the Film turns into a Wonka Trilogy that will be sick

Wonka 2023
Willy Wonka 2026
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 1971"
Im pleased this is an origin story rather than a reboot It looks like it could actually be delightful which is a nice change lately
This is my everything  I love it 
Bazinga
too much cringe diversity casting
Im not going to lie Im 42 years old and this film is really not marketed for me but I really think this is going to be good full of the magic of the original
     
"I was going to say no cause no one can top Gene Wilder for me not even Johnny Depp 












But Im not mad at a Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa"
HE isth back
"Willy Wonka is now Wonka due to him having no Willy
And here I thought it was because they made that character a girl"
Good to see they put in the Token blacks for wokeness
Nothing will beat johnny depp as wonka sorry kid
Of course have to get the blacks into it After all its 2023
Enough already
ngl his acting is terrible
Yes  Ignore the freaky Depp version  This embraces the Gene Wilder version and THAT is pure genius
And the Oscar for dumbest remake in order to blatantly profit off of a dumb retelling of a fantastic childrens story goes to
Looks insanely horrible If you think it looks good you are actually a queertard
Tim as willy wonka is super cute Gonna watch it for sure but I wont expecting too much
shocked hes white
TIMOTHEEEEEE
Trash Made for braindead morons
This looks awful The thing about Wonka before was how simple and endearing everything was The magic felt realistic because it was within everyday things Shoving a bunch of cgi and fireworks in to make up for whats missing from the original isnt going to cut it for me Stop sucking the life out of everything wonderful Come up with something new and stop beating a dead horse This didnt need to be made and by the looks of it it shouldnt have Millions of dollars for a lifeless prequel that nobody asked for that changes the already established story  This is a no all around from me
No thanks
Looks great but Chalamet cannot play that character at all damn
It will never be like the original
Soraya Aishwaria Polfranscheski Gonzlez si estas aqu es Samuelnecesito hablar contigo no es nada malo por favor
He said Scratch that flip it and reverse it
Why do they keep putting black people in classic European fairytales
MATTHEW BAYNTON IS IN IT AND HUGH GRANT IS AN OOMPA LOOMPA MATT LUCAS 2 THIS CAST
Nopegive me Gene Wilders version any day 
Another bomb at the cinema
Im getting so bored of the meaningless drivel Hollywood keeps producing The mass display of uninspired sequels and prequels of large entertainment properties created by corporate big shots never cease to put me in a melancholic mood
I thought Hugh Grant was going to start twerking at 220
Cant wait m really exciteddddddd
Lil Mabu as Wonka is not something we wanted but something we needed
One things for certain All chocolates sweets and candies will be wiped off of the cinema canteens
Ok so I have a few questions wheres slugworth What happens to the original partner
Of course the girl is nevermind
217 too late Ive started dancing now once weve started dancing we cant stop
 flop
"I think this movie is a prequel for the original Charlie and the chocolate factory from 1971 aka Willy Wonka  the chocolate factory because the oompa loompa in this one is the same one as the 1971 version orange skin and green hair

Also the reason Im saying that is because the 2005 Charlie and the chocolate factory with Johnny Depp the Oompa Loompas are different and isnt portrayed as a lil man with a shiny red suit on and a black hair

Either way Im definitely gonna go see it cuz this was one of my fav movies growing up"
Lowkey really excited
103 is that Rowan Atkinson 
Cannot waittttt
I like that they dont show too much here Most trailers these days pretty much show the entire movie making the trailer better than the movie and giving too much away Theres huge gaps here and i like it
Who asked for this Who wanted this
Well at least Matt Baynton is in it
This looks awful and lacks colour
Maybe I missed it but where was Charlie
Sothis Willy Wonka is from Gene Wilder  not Johnny Depp universe
Wheres Johnny tho This guy sucks
"So quiet up and listen down
no scratch that reverse it 
ngl he ate that "
Boring
Oh my gosh THIS LOOKS SOOOO GOOD 
This onex 4 gen Z oirs was willywonka
Great
"Omg 
This is beautiful 
Im happy Wonka"
Wow using CGI to take jobs away from little people who could have played the oompa loompas
Finally a happy Film 
More PC garbage nobody wants
They ruined Willy wonka with a tik toker
Im such a wonka aswell
ommmg mr beaaan and one of d classic movies 3
I especially loved the part where Willy said Its Wonkin Time and Wonkaed everyone in sight
Let the haters doubt They havent even seen the movie just their quick judgements on the trailer lmao And you wonder why people are always so miserable
"it would have been MUCH better if it was a prequel of CHARLIE and the chocolate factory and not willy wonka and the chocolate factory it should have been a prequel to the Tim Burtons version not that weird Gene Wilder one the 1971 changed the story too much it wasnt a fun watch for me while the 2005 one NAILED the book with more story added to it such as Willy Wonkas dad which even Roald Dahls family admitted it was better than the 1971 one Im sorry WB but you should have thought better

Roald Dahl HATED the 1971 movie as it has insulted him and his book he passed away before the 2005 one came out which his family thanked Tim Burton for making it saying Roald would be proud

despite my dislike to the 1971 movie and my thoughts on how pedofilic wonka acted in it Its my opinion and I respect others opinions as well"
So excited
Sooo many bots on here drinking from the chocolate river lol
This looks terrible Barforama
I see that the oompa loompa is going to look just like the one in the original 1971 film Like thats cool
pancake
This looks utterly horrible lmao
IK i can always trust warner bros to deliver one of the best movies
Watched the one where Johnny Depp is Wonka so now its time This one looks pretty good
Its STRIKE that reverse it not scratch that reverse it Right at the beginning of the trailer too Face palm
Tried of Hollywood just make some old movie prequel Is there truly no origin ideas for movie industry
I would love to see this because I really love Willy Wonka
Idk man I cant wrap my head around it majority of me doesnt wanna watch it in too biased with wilders performance and I feel like the movie was perfect on its own I really dont wanna see how he started or became Willy wonka I would rather see how Charlie is putting up
This movie is gonna be fun and I am here for it
Hearing a refreshed and upmastered World of pure imagination song gives me chills I rrally would love to hear the full version of that new version
"What is this supposed to be and where is it supposed to be set
Talk about not respecting the source material but then thats modern cinema
This looks like it was made by Disney"
Smh lol
Ive started dancing now 
Horrible acting hes just way too soft and seems less enthusiastic at times
"No Please God no    Facepalm

I mean other than Rowan Atkinson theres no reason for this"
I prefer Timothee in Dune 2 but I love me some good Xmas film
Another Charlie and the chocolate movie huh Looks sick
Waiting for the movie
Why
Love it already
We need a movie about what happened after Charlie took over the factory
How dare you stand where he stood
Musicians authors and screen writers should start making tear jerkers again People are cold these days Maybe it might wake some of them up Fckin estrogen festbut gruesome have em thinking about how far this path leads
You guys are being dramatic I cant wait to see the film
Johnny depp is the best willy wonka
Im not quite feeling wonka with chalamet but who knows it could come together well Jack Black is the Oompa Loompa i wanted but Hugh Grant is gonna nail this part
Just me who thinks a sad melancholy ending where it ends in him becoming a recluse leading into the events of the film would work quite well
What I like about this movie is that its that it could not be like the last two movies
Please for the love of God quit making dogshit movies Just stop it
cringe
The chocolate cartel
Finally Willy Wonka looks human
This has like a Harry Potter vibe to it
I love Timothee Chalamet but Im sorry I just dont think he fits the characther
The casting throws it off  but quick money
Hard pass Sorry
I cant imagine someone except Jony depp as willy wonka
Timothee looks good as wonka however I think he should have been played by Idris Elba
why they got hitler in there
This film looks really good I want to see this
God I love Keegan Michael key
Johnny depps wonka movie is still the best 3
Wonka lore expansion
nah beacause im genuinely so excited to see this
Lol I saw Rowan Atkinson playing a similar role to Mr Bean
lol
7 years traveling the world when did he start when he was 10
SO HYPED
I was hoping theyd give Jamie Bower from stranger things a shot as Wonka
Johnny Depp is my fav Willy
So closeonly one vowel out
We all know that it wont be as good as JDs Willy Wonka
HUGH GRANTlooks alrightbut pushing black america as 1930s britian is too much
i was going to pan this trailer but after watching it i found it really interesting  i hope the actual movie is as interesting  will wait and see 
When it said And the Producer of Harry Potter it just made it better
I think its disgusting that in this day and age of a woke society that they STILL think its okay to take actors of average height and digitally manipulate them to appear short We dont accept whitewashing anymore so why is this any different We have little actors who could clearly play these roles Why should we accept discrimination against height differences any more than skin colour This movie is going to be shockingly terrible Im never going to watch this and I hope whoever reads this wont watch it either Warner Brothers should be ashamed
tontonan masa kecilku ternyata ada sekuelnya kangen bangetttt btw timoti ganteng bangetttttttt
Yet Again they are ruining a masterpiece 
His acting seems off But the rest of the movie seems great
He looks like Daniel Thrasher
YES
no thanks
It doesnt look great tbf
The trailer looks really interesting but how can I ever see Timothe play Wonka when my soul is capable of remembering only Johnney and his every little expression
No one can replace jhony depps wonka
This was like way before Charlie Bucket Veruca Salt Mike TV Violet Beauregarde and Augustus Gloop were born when theyll be the 5 winners to find 5 Golden Tickets
Okay wut
Is it gonna be woke bollox
Terrible choice This looks very uninteresting
We need Johnny depp
lahh TIMMY 
"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul Or what shall a man give in return for his soul

For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God"
"For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his soul Or what shall a man give in return for his soul

For the wages of sin is death but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord

For our sake he made him to be sin who knew no sin so that in him we might become the righteousness of God"
Definitely gonna watch And i saw Mr Bean
the amount of cgi is a bit tiring not not mention whoever made this trailer pretty much followed the cookie cutter lets give the exact plot of the movie in a series of clips broken up by a bunch of oneliners I hate trailers that are the equivalent to those movies in 10 minutes channels Dont give us a summary of the movie give us a reason to go watch it
WB loves doing something like this arent they More and more characters got their own movie putting Hawkeye into shame Wonder whos next Alfred Commisioner Gordon Or some random hobo in Gotham City witnessing things so much they can make 2 hours long movie about it Cmon surprise me
Wonka potter looks awesome
Jhonny dept as Wonka 
I always knew Heisenberg was Willy Wonka
Black people in the prequel no black people in the original hm 
Honestly nothing new under the sun Have we really lost our imagination 
nothing can beat johnny depps performance
why is Mr Carson a chocolate cartel member
HYPE
Ive waited for this for years Pls dont mess it up pls
wonka ngene kok dibandingbandingke
What a shame  good idea but wrong cast after Deep and Gene Wilder this new Wonka Timothe Chalame falls short on all fronts
Rowan Atkitson
102 Rowan Atkinson
Finally a movie he actually belongs in
Y tho
Will this be a politically correct version that avoids using short people as Oompa Loompa
142 MR BEAN 
Damn he really does look like a younger Mr Wonka
This looks horrible
Rowan Atkinson running away from a giraffe is one of the funniest things Ive seen in a long time 
"Huh Huh A double Huh
Best line in cinema history diversity is our strength"
Huge Grant really surprised me in the end Really excited for this This looks more grounded and better then the jonny depp one
Chocolate world 
huh huh uh huh
oh its timothee IM watching
My god what were they thinking casting that wet noodle in the role of Willy Wonka Gene Wilder would be spinning in his grave
Eu amo esse filme
Looks fun Cant wait to watch it
How many Wonka movie are we getting so original another Willy Wonka movie yay lets repeat
I was skeptical of this at first cause duh another remake yeah yeah not exactly a remake but still BUT im more open to it now when i saw that it was directed by the same person who directed paddington which as we all know is a CLASSIC guess im curious for this one
Nothing new under the sun
My kind of origin story  its none superhero but chocolate related
Seems cheap and predictable
150 is that the woman from paddington like is it the same actor
wow Rowan Atkinson is in the movie
Paul Atreides sure has changed
Why do they have to ruin a classic
Finally anoter movie of willy wonka
Ohhh great Have to see that movie 
Cant beat gene wilders Willy wonka all this cgi and everything is over the top for this movie the old one felt like it was real in that era this just looks over the top
It looks cute and fun I have to see this movie
Wrong casting
All I was thinking is Johnny Depps Wonka
Crazy how my childhood favorite movie with Johnny Depp is getting another remake 
Cant wait for this 
timothe is perfect for the role tbh
Very excited and seems promising But Cant really forget what a class act Johnny Depp was in the first one Timothe is good But Really missing the mysterious vibe
These are the kind of movies we wanna see
Hope its good
What a trailer it looks AMAZING The original Willy Wonka films and the Tim Burton film are my fiancees favorite movies of all time She is going to lose it watching this It actually made me cry with joy this trailer
Is that mosby
I LOVE MUSICALSSSS
""
what a perfect film for the holidays
Mr Bean
I do t get why they keep remaking films especially when there was just a recent remake There are no original ideas anymore
iconic
"So theyre just gonna make his dentist dad disappear
Also not sure if Timothy is weird enough to play Willy Wonka"
This is third third remake Willy works movie
Movie looks horrible
Its good to see Rowan Atkinson again in a film he is a legend
Paul Atreides this is what happens when u watch Barbie
""
Follow TheWonkaBoy on twitch 
Doubt it will be as good as the 2005 one with Johnny Depp
"Chalamet might be the worst casting choice for this role 
He made me cringe at least three times in this trailer"
mi tim
SJW woke trash 
mr bean
this seems so good
perfect casting
omg
Is this a prequel
Am i the only one who saw rowan atkinson
Good to see Johnson on the big screen
140 IS THAT MRBEAN
IS THAT MRBEAN 
I admit I was skeptical but this does look good
I love Charlies and the chocolate factory so much I watch it million of times Cant get enough of Johnny Depp Wonkas character And getting to know that theres a Wonkas movie coming soon Oh gosh My Christmas couldnt be better
Its not the same without Gene Wilder
Genial 
Chalamet should get oscar sooner or later
Hmmm cant wait
Mr Woke himself Hugh Grant
As bad as Hershey chocolate 
Broooo Rowan Atkinson
Whats the difference between this movie and Charlie and the chocolate factory
Could we maybe nit make thia film the mystery was one of the things in the film that was great adding another film no one asked for The industry has gotten lazy
Why would you ruin a classic
Aldulterating yet another classic
Rowan
Brung back the original cast
Timothee is a gem man
Amazing
I cant wait to laugh at this film in the theater because it looks so bad
So what is this exactly
This actually looks brilliant
Wait Wheres Johnny Depp
Waiting for it
Pass
Oke i want to see
"Are Timothee Chalamet and Tom Holland the only youngish male actors left in Hollywood If Im not seeing one in a new movie or series its the other one

Give opportunities to other talents"
So this is kinda of a reboot and a backstory
"This gonna make a perfect Christmas this year 

I have been wondering ever since I was young while there are several Wonkas sweet products came out on sale there is never a Wonkas bar"
TIMOTHEE
Idk all I see is Timothee chalamet instead of wonka
""
Johnny depp would have been better at this roll
oh Mr Bean is here The run away guy
WHY WHY NOT JUST CREATE SOMETHING NEW THERES STILL SO MUCH NEW IDEAS OUT THERE AND ALL YOU BIG STUDIOS ARE JUST MAKING REMAKES REIMAGINATIONS RE THIS RE THAT COME ON YOURE MULTIMILLION DOLLAR STUDIOS TAKE RISKS AND INVENT SOMETHING NEW YOU UNCREATIVE HACKS
Anyone ever realised that the oompa loompas are actually colonised slave farmers wonka can not sell chocolate in his factory if his workers dont make the cocoa How about make a film about how farmers are exploited and treated unfairly to make the chocolate for wonka and the effect it has on deforestation and climate change No unique story just retelling old wonka films in a modern setting  I would like a oompa loompa film that would be interesting to watch
Oh dear 
Yay the 3rd reboot
No Johnny Depp  No watch
He will never be Johnnie Depp
So is this a prequal to the gene wilder movie Or just its own canon
This feels like its going to be a classic
"Still cannot compare to Gene Wilders 1971 role performance and execution of his role as Willy Wonka 

The 1971 adaptation is a historical masterpiece and is part of the LOC archives for historical accuracy and achievements for American History  

He made my childhoodand I remember begging my mom to let us watch Willy Wonka The Chocolate Factory multiple timesand she was feeling so damn annoyed and frustrated

So she played it for me I am so proud of mommy for ever doing it for me "
"We need more light hearted filmsbut Hollywood says no Yeah no lets not take it up a notch More depressing films please with spooky vampires and love twists that will shock you for life 

Thank you so much Thank you Hollywood and TIMOTHE"
Yh but Johnny Depp gave this character a meaning
055 I know where this little shot was filmeddd it was filmed in Lyme Regis south coast of england
I love it
I 100 sure that there will be a thing that  hugh grant for playing a ompa lompa and taking work from midges
Timothy acting seems awkward
is this a tiktoker
No way are we getting a Willy Wonka origin story thats directed by Paul King and it looks THIS GOOD This might be the first time I nearly cried over a trailer This truly looks like its going to be magical
Looks to woke
"Me watching the trailer then seeing Rowan Atkinson 
Me well NOW I have to watch this movie"
Thimothee Is an Icon Chalamet 
i am so violently excited for this wow
Not gonna lie I was against yet another remake in Hollywood until I saw Sally Hawkins and almost cried for no reason I just love her 
So original
Did anyone saw mrbean
I hope they use Rowan Atkinsons character a bit Itd be a crime to have him in this film and underuse his talents
i wasnt looking forward to this at all but now im ready to cry in theaters on christmas eve
no
No
why they tryna ruin the og willy wonka name this looks terrible 
Wonka is he was real definitely killed some natives and had slaves
The only thing I dont agree with is I reckon they should have kept the Oompa Loompas the same size like the original Still cant wait to see
hot take but I think Timothe was miscast as Wonka hes not as whimsically charming as this character should be Hes more fitting for a quiet emo boy
Every good thing started with a dream Fav line of the trailer now I will watch it
God i hope this movie will be good cuz this trailer was such a treat
Why not use a proper midget
MrBeanYYYAAAYYY
Cant wait for decemberrrr
Damn how much black people
ngl this is masterpiece
Hey another willy wonka movie
This looks like an SNL sketch
I need them to do those promotional Wonka bars too like they did with the last movie
Primary school ahh acting
Im angry
Cant wait
Stupid
Finally Im been dreaming and waiting like forever when willy run away from home I was wondering about all his journey and I hope someone answer me when I ask how can a big house disappear like magic 
153 is it just me or does he look a lot like Gene Wilder in this clip He actually had a bow tie on just like Wilders version of wonka
On one hand Roald Dahl might be rolling in his grave Other hand I am interested in seeing this
Hmm Ill give it a chance but Im worried by the lack of quirkiness and whimsy  Its not fair to expect someone to follow up Gene so I wont hold him to those standards
Black woman of course theres a black woman
TUH I see yall not complaining abt this but complain abt every black movie  coming from a white person
""
PLEASE I WANNA BE A OOMPA LOOMPA
Thank God its super inclusive 
 
How did that actor get the lead role Appallingly weak
Oof this clearly showcases the expressionlimits and delivery limits of Timothe
why we need another willy wonka movie
ITS WONKIN TIME
who going to watch it cause i am
Only reson to se This is Grant as a that 
This is gonna cause a 3rd generation of blueberry fetishists on deviant art isnt it
timothee looks goofy THIS IS SUCH A MISCAST he just doesnt have that charisma of Willy Wonka
A public cringe fest No thanks ill pass lol
Boring Next
Johnny Depp is our Wonka 
"Well begin with a spin
Traveling in the world of my creation
What well see will defy
Explanation
If you want to view paradise
Simply look around and view it
Anything you want to do it
Want to change the world
Theres nothing to it Wonka"
it makes me wonder whos gonna play as Charlie Bucket
Super excited 
Looks cool 
This looks awful and terrible and really bad
Perfect for Christmas time
Why do they cast wonka younger with every new movie lol
Just like marvel Warner bros DC Now Wonka has a multiverse 
clickin on this trailer i was scared after my boy peter pan got butchered to death but after watching it i feel excited to see it xD
Oh wowww
Nice to see a Wonka Dark Chocolate version 
you have probably heard this question more than oncebut how to become an oompa loompa
This is not so true the ommpa lommpa were suplosed to lived in a jungle not kept in a secret shoppe somebody need to justified this 
I was suuuuuuuper skeptical until I saw Director of Paddington Now Im just straight up sitting in wait
ehhJohnny Depps Willy Wonka still way better than this
Its good but my willy wonka the best is Jonny Depp
No se ustedes pero se ve del carajo sobre todo la actuacin de wonka
Idk why but I was a bit skeptical of tim when I heard he was gonna be Willy but Im actually pretty cool with it now
So this is the story of young Wonka before Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
The only true Willie Wonka was Gene Wilder
Soooo excited 
Is it weird that I think the humor will be to modern Its hard to explain what I mean
He kills children in the future and yet he teams up with a child in this movie That child will not survive
I think neither willy wonka didnt need a prequel movie nor timothee is suitable for giving that amount of absurd energy Well I do not have my hopes high for this movie but Id definitely give it a chance hope this will be the last wonka movie it already has great adaptations you dont need to milk it once in a while
Im sooo excited
He like a child friendly Walter white man 
This looks amazing tbh
Mrbeast
This is genuinely so delightful and refreshing Its about time we got a film with some soul again
Is this the real Wonka movie where I can go to cinema on November 13th and fard after eeting chocate
I dont celebrate Christmas but its good its releasing in December it has those good vibes
I was not prepared for this trailer but it looks good I like there telling a story about Wonka past
gwapo mo mister chalamet
Nice
An Oompa Loompa who talks like Christopher Hitchens is rather delicious
goofy
I mean it doesnt look like a bad movie I guess
My service dog is named Willy I had him dressed up as Willy Wonka for Halloween Too bad its too small for him now But it would be nice to show him Willy Wonka
Sorry but youre never going to get a better Willy Wonka than Gene Wilder
This looks amazing Cant wait for December
Happy it looks like a prequel to the 1971 movie bases on how to oompa loompas look like and Willy Way better than the 2005 version
Charlie  The Chocolate Factory movie
NAHH AINT NO WAY
Its so gorgeous I want to cry
This movie looks bad honestlyTim does not fit the energetic side of wonka
i was screaming cuz the set looks so much like harry potter n then i saw omg im so excited
Why is he so beautiful 
I hope they show why and how he shut down his factory what made him mad at the world
Omfg
OMG I CANT WAIT
Never saw Timothe Chalamet as wonka but hey im willing to check this out
It looks ok and allI just dont exactly see the need 
yes but does he say good morning starshine  the earth days hello  i dont think so
Should of casted Kevin Hart as the Oompa Loompas to cut down the budget
Would have loved to see jhonny depp as willy wonka but this also look great
A very different version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Why is it that there has to be a third rendition of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory when theres a second book in the franchise called Charlie And The Great Glass Elevator thats never been turned into a movie
Is this movie will involved super train moving non stop while the wolrd freezing
There is Sand in my chocolate
Why does Hugh Grants oompaloompa look so CGId though Lol they really didnt need to make his face look so plastic
Twink wonka Wtf
Driffrent Movie Willy Woka
Mr Bean better get some chocolate beans in this movie
no
Theres so many things goin on I just saw The Nun 2 just earlier and this now Im here for it
My favorite part is when he Wonkas his Willy
This casting for Willie Wonka makes me cringe hard Not a big fan of timothee
I admit this looks like its going to be a pretty good movie but Im curious as to why there is yet another Wonka movie I know movie ideas are few and far between these days but at the end of the day Im hoping this version will be a good one 
Looks like it was written by ChatGPT
Whats the justification for this movie
trying to make willy wonka into harry potter
"Ok this movie looks bad

Edit Is that Mr Mosby"
I will watch this after I smoke
"So let me guess  the little black girl is the one who was behind Willie Wonka 
Naaa "
Mr Carson 
Where the umpalumpas
At last a movie to match the genius of the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
I cant imagine the lengths that Warner Bros will go to market Wonka It would be pure imagination for them to promote the movie via Wonkathemed Hershey bars that may or may not have a free ticket to see the movie
This movie about to make millions 
Timmy will be great but Jeremy Allen White would have soooo good he resembles young Gene Wilder
Still confused as to why the black girl is attached to Wonka at all hes a loner type who cares more for his chocolate than others and anyone in that role would feel weird
Wow I guess its true what they say Hollywood will recreate movies so many times cause they to CHICKEN TO WRITE ANYTHING NEW JUST LIKE DISNEY BABACK
"U know U love the movie when its what it was meant to be 
Thanks God Disney didnt make this "
The set looks great and so do the clothes but the guy doesnt feel right he feels like a salesman here not like the aloof Wonka
Why
This movie looks like absolute trash and I love the kid playing wonka but it looks so bad not sure what these people are talking about cant wait to see it please smh
Why Just pay your writers what their worth so they can make up something new and creative This is so so ridiculous
Ok im definitely watching this once it comes out in cinemas 
So proud of Timmy
Finally a mainstream movie in which Timothe Chalamet gets to be as goofy onscreen as he is IRL
I know right guys and do you know Chocolate is my favorite 
yay horrible history guy
I know right guys and do you know Chocolate is my favorite 
Tbh this is not going to beat the 1971 and the 2005 movies
IS THAT MR BEAN IN THE NEW WILY WONKA MOVIE
Hollywood bringing this out with all this hoopla and love basically in the same instant that the west is madly working to censor Roald Dahls books The man is not good enough to have his works maintain their original composition but hey still might as well try to make another billion off of his corpse
Kind of unnecessary but I think its worth a shot
From the makers of Paddington This is gonna be delightful
Nothing can beat the original 1971 Willy Wonka film The practical effects in that are far superior than any of the CGI in this Wonka prequel Its too bad they didnt go the practical effects route Were lucky to be living in the time of Christopher Nolan who believes in doing everything practical  his new film Oppenheimer has no CGI in it which he stated in a recent interview and it looks stunning
"Top 3 Wonka
1 Mr Beast
2 Thanos
3 Jack Sparrow"
BAD
Another stupid British movie
It looks good visually but its probably not gonna impress actingwise Its obvious the actors were chose for diversity reasons rather than best actors they could find
WONKA WONKA WONKA 
He doesnt fit playing theres no character just a twink reciting lines
Looks meh
"All i can say is

Look at how they massacred my boy"
Looks like a lot of fun
Thee worst actor oy vey
This movie is going to be terrible The give away for me was 043 the entire movie is going to be pulling teeth like this
Look what hellywood vomited
Aw Jesus tap dancing Christ I dont know how to feel about this The original two were my childhood Now this I dunno Im cool if others like it but This aint it
Ofc they put the blacks in this movie
I highly anticipate seeing this Magical
Cool 
Getting odd vibes from this trailer For some reason when I first heard of the prequel I thought we would get a more serious type of movie This movie looks very forgettable I think Chalamet is a great actor but this role doesnt suit him in my opinion
I cant stop watching this damn trailer lol
you can not convince me that daniel thrasher isnt the one playing wonka
The ONLY ISM Hollywood knows is plagiarism Dorothy Parker true in the 20s and still true to this day
Mr bean
i have nothing against Timothe Chalamet but Jermey Allen White would totally crush this role
Lil Mabu 
This might be the worst movie trailer Ive ever seen in my life
hehe
Mr Wonka ITS JULY You expect me to wait for December for this masterpiece 
Bad trailer showed too much I now really dont feel like Im missing out on anything
I guess we cant just be original anymore
Looks stupid
Timothy Chalamet looks so much like my ex girlfriend its distracting
This is a perfect cast
""
Casting him as Willy Wonka is the worst film making decision Ive seen
eh johhny depp did this in 2005 whats the point of this
Who up wonkin they willy rn
had to put the woke inclusion black girl to ruin a great piece of history     ill still watch it though
010 I cringed at this
Damn it now I want to watch this
oh god no
That looks cute I will be first in line to see it
Sois this a prequel to Johnnys or to Genes I say Genes Their outfits are almost identical And his demeanor seems more on the crazy OCD side like Genes version
Warner Bros is killing it lately whilst i felt nothing remotely similar like this related to anything by Disney lol Just a thought that crossed my mind Im gonna watch Barbie and Wonka and Oppenheimer by Universal which is weird because I dont go to the cinema very often
I wish the director did a better job instructing the main character The animevoice exaggeration makes my ears bleed
OUUUU  this looks so good i cant wait for it to be releasedd
Who wants a chocolate that makes you fly
D888
Another movie to look forward too
This is less Willy Wonka and more Mary Poppins to me Im skeptical about this one
Chalamet is a wonderful actor not feeling him in this role though Still hoping its a solid movie just not sure if he can pull off the zaniness of being Wonka
You may modernize but never beat the original
Mr Bean is that you 
Dont mess with de chocolate cartel mayne
Never thought Daniel thrasher would take up chocolate making
TIM BURTON 
I zoned out watching this sorry
Cant wait for this
Did willy wonka told everyone that they stole the chocolate beans from central amrica and mxico to take to europa and make them selfs famous from cultivating chocolate beans from  hundreds and hundreds years before them just a question from my ancestors
I like him better than Depp
DEI strikes again Looks like trash Cant wait to not watch it 
Im not excited for this at all
It would have been better  if he sounded more like Gene Wilders rendition
""
"                 
               "
this  looks  so good
this is who its done
Damn Im not watching the new wonka just because its this dogshit actor doing it For sure Im not watching and its sad because I would have like to but this dude is annoying asf
Criiiiiiiiiiinge
I wanna see a fat boy get stuck in the chocolate tube if that aint in this movie I dont wanna see it
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory is one of my favorite movies of all time Gene Wilder left huge shoes to fill and from this trailer Chalamet is not a convincing Wonka Disappointing Of course I would LOVE to be wrong about this and would enjoy being pleasantly surprised But as of now I will likely just watch the film eventually on streaming or dvd
Timothe just so cringe
This looks very bad Please no
Im going to give it a shot But if I can be completely honest this looks like hot garbage
Yo they got lil mabu to play Willy wonka
OMG I CAN NOT WAIT Every time I see this preview I get chills the whole time So happy this isnt a remake and looks to be an absolute masterpiece 
Is this like an origin story of Willy Wonka
YOOOO MR BEAN 
Johnny Depp 
So this is like The Harry Potter Franchise saying Hey Tim Burton FU 
Oh God this looks dull and lame
lame
NOPE just NOPE
Too bad its not period correct
I hope with future remakes of any show or movie they do it justice and they dont overdue but this one might actually be good
059 REGGIE
I wish the actor was 30 year old Johnny Depp 
Long love the fighters Oh whoops wrong movie
Kind of annoyed that people are complaining about Timothy being too much like himself in the movie What so you want him to be depressing I think this looks really good just give it a chance
Fizzy lifting drink wasnt invented even during Willy wonks and choco fac what the f
Sigh
Why
Sorry after the deepburton fiasco Im not interested
Miss the laugh but theres nothing to be seen
that looks absolutely not for me
if this film does not include a reference to Snowpiercer I will cry
Weird movie
who else wonking their willy fr fr
As a kid growing up watching the original Im a huge fan This looks like it could be very promising After the abysmal Johnny Depp remake I truly hope so
Good cast potentially good castING but can we get an original idea out of Hollywood instead of retreads just once Please
Huh that was a rollercoaster of emotions in a 2 minute trailer  First I was doubtful then excited then teary when I saw Sally Hawkins as his mother then laughed out loud at Hugh Grant  Im sold  Looks like maybe a musical too  Doubly sold 
"WTF I DINT EXPECT THIS
AND ROWAN ATKINSON

THIS WILL BE A SWEET TREAT AND A SWEET DAY"
Honestly who is asking for this Whos the intended audience I cant fathom kids today connecting to this
The only thing good about this trailer was the half second of Matt Lucas and the 3 seconds of Hugh Grant Does anyone need a Wonka origin story Unless it ends with a tragedy that compels him to build his candy torture chamber murder factory then its pretty pointless
With Peace and Love Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka is the best for me Even the OG one cant win Timothees Wonka kinda boring for me
Yes
looks woke  looks dreadful Hugh looks good but cannot save this POS
This looks so awful
Okay I saw this thinking its gonna be another trashy remake But after watching it Im hoping itll be good Im glad theyre sticking to the OG version too
Lollipops
naur
Looks leaps and bounds better than the Time Burton rubbish
I am a simple girl I see Wonka and I click
Is this a joke
I like the idea but I realllyy dont like chalomet as wonka
Ive got a feeling that this is going to be yet another fantastic film Just by watching this says it all
I sincerely hope this is good not banking on it but hoping
Well my enthusiasm for this movie completely dropped after seeing this trailer
Im offended that you dont have midgets cast as Oompa Loompas
Damn mr bean randomly in the middle is hilarious
From Paul Atreides to Willy Wonka I wonder where his talents take us to next
Wanka
Why not make a reboot of the charlie and the chocolate factory movie instead
I dont mind the actor they chose for willy Wonka he looks the part but this movie looks like garbage 
Too late Ive started dancing now Once weve started dancing we cant stop
Is it just me or did I see Keegan MichaelKey
Wanka
This move is gonna a big nope and I can smell it
"ARGHHHH so exciteddd ive been asking my sister why they wont make another Charlie  Chocolate factory movie because it will be such a great hit and now i cant believe theres another oneeeee


ps eventhough i expect different moves ahhahah but its okayy"
  
This is going to be a classic
im a simple girl i see timothee chalamet and i click on the video
Is anyone else tired of seeing the same three actors starring in every film I wish Hollywood would widen their casting pool a bit
Man I was cringing hard through that whole trailer but when Hugh Grant showed up I actually laughed a little Hmmmmm
Ig this is another musical
Woman actress 
Haters back down I 100 support Timothy in this role
Am I the only who thinks that Timothee Chalamet looks like Daniel Thrasher
Its gonna be weird seeing him in basically an open world setting
Y if youre exited
"Willy Wonka is a Wizard by deartumb1r

Mr Wonka Dumbledore smiled warmly looking down into the Pit from his podium The members of the Wizengamot muttered disapprovingly shifting in their seats Willy Wonka clad today in a bright magenta suit and tophat beamed cheekily up at them from his chair his silvergloved hands cradling his chin 

Mr Dumbledore He replied brightly with the barest hint of a lisp 

I trust you know why you are here Dumbledores question was crisp and businesslike but the twinkle in his eye gave away his amusement at the situation 

Not at all Ive nary a clue Wonka wiggled his eyebrows Dumbledore audibly stifled a laugh 

You are accused of improper use of magic improper use of muggle artifacts and several counts of using magic in front of a muggle Dumbledore reminded him He conjured a projection with his wand Displayed in grainy sepia was Willy Wonka arm around a boy of around 10 Behind his back he twitched an ash wand and machines in the background around them whirred to life producing all manner of sweets 

The projection ran its course and collapsed and Dumbledore stowed his wand back inside his robes

Wonka smiled and fiddled with his hat 

How do you plead Dumbledore asked leaning forward eagerly for what would surely be an amusing trial 

Not guilty on all counts Wonka said perhaps a tad smugly

The members of the Wizengamot muttered amongst themselves Not Guilty Impossible

Dumbledore hushed them quickly Explain if you would We have after all quite a mountain of evidence

Wonka stood and brushed a bit of dust off his suit He tipped his hat mischievously Of course he grinned 

Firstly use of magic shall only be considered improper whereby it is applied to cause harm or applied recklessly All magic used in my sweets is rigorously tested for both safety and taste It is not used to cause harm but to bring joy Wonka paused to adjust his jacket 

But surely Dumbledore said leafing through his notes you cannot deny that you illegally charmed several thousand muggle artifacts

Ah but I can Wonka said now twirling his cap in his hands Muggle artifact refers of course to any muggle made object But you see I built those machines each and every one They are not muggle machines at all but wizarding machines built by a wizard The factory itself as well You could argue that as machines are a muggle invention I still broke the rules but then I could argue that every wizard dwelling with any charms applied to its walls is in violation of the law as muggles were the first to make bricks

The Wizengamot glared silently He was right of course Violating the spirit of the law was not illegal if one followed the letter 

And the last charge These are definitely Muggle children are they not No magical talent raised in muggle society Dumbledore straightened his glasses and peered down at Wonka his eyes still bright with intrigue 

Not at all Wonka grinned placing his hat back on his head You see the ticket system was not nearly so random as I pretended The tickets were charmed they would only becomes visible to children with magical heritage All the children chosen were second generation Squibs Wonka bowed low as if he were finishing a particularly well executed play 

Well ladies and gentlemen it seems no laws were violated after all Dumbledore stifled a grin at the groans of angry disapproval from the Wizengamot 

But he very clearly violated the intent of the rules Spluttered a large rather red faced wizard in the second row Hes justcheating Hes cheating

Ah this is true but he did not technically speaking break any of the rules He did not expose muggles to magic nor enchant muggle made objects nor improperly apply magic anymore so than any magical confectioner Im afraid we have to let him go Dumbledore smiled gently and put away the rather thick file with Wonkas name embossed on the cover For the brief second it was open a list of hundreds of charges with Not Guilty inked beside them was visible It was carried off by a house elf and the Wizengamot began to file out until only Dumbledore was left 

Youre a very clever man He called down to Wonka We could use you at Hogwarts you know

No thank you Wonka called back grinning Skirting the law is far more fun"
Looks absolutely horrible
Looks silly and wrong
Not feeling Chalamet as Wonka
I hope thats wonka slave
Im in
Cringe 0
Ok Gene Wilders Wonka is one of my favorite movies ever  I didnt like Johnny Depps  This looks good  A different pov and more unknown stories of his life before the golden tickets
Mmmmmm yeah this guy definitely read a script for this movie
I like it and will watch it
"Now make a horror version Pure Imagination 

Cut to out of tune jukebox music"
Nadwar really got a movie huh
Jeeeeezzz December
Its a little funny because he looks like how I imagine Charlie would be after taking over Wonkas chocolate factory  I think it is a nice spinoffprequel to the storys origins
The here we go Mama got me right in the 
It comes down to if they can tell the story well and if its a good story which Im really hoping for
Is this movie just for reparations
Finally some creativity in the movie making world
Another overhyped backstory remake
At last a movie that makes us want to feel good about Christmas endless chocolate and the return of an iconic classic  Were coming for you Veruca Salt and Augustus Gloop 
Am I the only one who thinks Timothee as Wonka is terrible He doesnt suit the Wonka character
Movie looks cornier then the others
Hugh Jackman would have a made a better Wonka
At this point Ill watch anything without a political message
What are the odds this is going to be an excruciating POS
"how will we ever compete with these other corporations
Willy wonka well there is this race of small people that are willing to work for free Thats gotta do wonders for overhead costs"
Here we go mama
""
Wellat least its not a remake
Willy Wokea
I liked Johny depp version more this one is flat
""
Like if this is going to be a W movie
TIMOTHEE AND ROWAN ATKINSON I HAVE TO WAYCH THUS
chocolate must flow
Will Bruce Berman be in executive producer for Wonka
"             
          "
Jim Carters voice 
Im a HUGE Timothee Chalamet fan and was ecstatic when i found out he was playing this role some months agobut his performance in this trailer feels a bit of a let down to me I love the fact that the movie is more of an origin story than a retelling of the chocolate factory but Timothee honestly doesnt seem well suited for the role seeing this It doesnt feel naturally fantastical at all it feels very forced And thats coming from someone who absolutely wants Timothee to succeed
Good god is Hollywood EVER going to make a new idea ever again
Wait so he was making crazy things like chocolate that makes people fly BEFORE he even had his chocolate factory I was always under the assumption that the crazy stuff inside the factory was all experimental and not ready for the public yet and that the stuff sold in the shops was just regular chocolate such as the Wonka bar and the Scrumdiddlyumptious bar so everyone was surprised by all the crazy stuff inside the factory
it just feels like a rehearsal on a bad day low energy
wow nice if freddie highmore was on his mid 20s i bet he also will make a remarkable portraying willie wonka
"The Trilogy is now complete 

1 Wonka

2 Willy Wonka

3 Snowpiercer"
"Hello Humans
Dont put all your effort into a human that rejects you at every turn

TERRANCE OUT"
Yay The movie nobody wanted
Will this be good
More soulless cinema
Love Timmy but this does not look good
F this and Dune Copypaste garbage
Willy Wonka And The Diversity Factory
He wants to be Jim Carrey so bad
Se ve increible Timothee me compr con este papel diciembre llega ya
F you Enough with the remakes F you
Honestly the role doesnt suit Timothe
Stupid one star
This shi looks trash asf
I think this is genuinely gonna be good f the haters
Im going to be honest I dont like this I love Paddington
Yes people who made chocolatechanged livescalled diabetes
This looks absolutely unhinged and I am 100 here for it
This is probably the worst rendition of Willy wonka
I had a dream about willy Wonka the night this movie trailer came out what a coincidence
108 Im so glad they are going to keep his kill streak up
my guy looks like phillip gallagher
Willy Wonka has always been the best character ever its so nice to see finally have a stand alone willy wonka movie but i also need an Charlie tribute and also Johny Depp made Willy wonka iconic but i know Timothee can pull it of nice
Literally every line Timothy gives off is horrible
Oh my God what
What makes this movie sad is Wonka does all this just to go recluse later in life to give it all up I wonder if it will show that
Gr8 casting sure this will be fantastic  but Gene Wilder will always be the best  for me remember watching the film on VHS for the first time it was magical im sure the kids of today will say the same either of Johnny depp  or Timothe Chalamet
Is nobody going crazy that TIMOTHEE CHALAMET is playing WILLY WONKA
""
How many mf movies can we make off other movies gd
Matenaiyo
Ah yes the obligatory forced diversity
Tim the future of hollywood
The delivery of wonka feels off And the jokes too
This feels very corporate
Ive been saying this for years chamalet is surely the next Johnny depp I can see that entire personality becoming the next favorite to tim burton
Hard to watch this without Johnny Depp so although Im disappointed Im curious 
Hard pass
So we are in a age where blacks have to be in every single movie No matter what Absolutely ridiculous Get woke go broke 
Nope Not excited abt this
Wonka movie july 14
A world of pure imagination
Some movies you just need to leave alone and Gene Wilders Willy Wonka is one of them he did not approve of the Jonny Depp remake and Im sure he would not be happy about this one the original was perfect in every way leave it alone already
was that mrbean
We are the Dream Makers and we are the Dreamer of Dreams
"Oompa Loompa this is so cool
If you ask me any hater of this movies a fool"
No
Once again Hollywood is regurgitating a classic movie because they cant think of any original ideas
Am youtuber
After the shot of Sally Hawkins throwing a kiss I was sold
I wouldve preferred it if they wouldve gone a lil darker and more serious tone for the origin of Wonka but oh well
Not sure how to explain why but I hated everything about that 
If 2020 tiktok were a film
Again
Cannot wait for this 
After Hollywoods dismal movie output so far this year this looks refreshing Thisand the upcoming Napoleon movie with Joaquin Phoenix 
Seems like a beautiful film but the timothee casting seems forced 
Warner bros are on a role first Barbie and now Wonka
This is more exciting than barbie and oppanhimer for me
MATHEW BAYNTON OMG
Get woke go broke
Everyone has lost ideas now they are just making new movies of old ideas
Hes somehow channeling BOTH previous film portrayals while also doing something original I hope this film incorporates Wonka being a man of somewhat dubious intent
Another wonka Woohoo
YO THAT OMPA LOMPA GOT A DUMPY THO GOD DAYUM
omg guys LETS GOOOOOOO
The PERFECT Christmas movie
Of course they had to made his side kick a black girl
Oh how I wish Christopher Lee could reprise his role as Willys father The introduction of the relationship between him and his mother is so exciting Im interested to see if her overwhelming support is able to outweigh his fathers disapproval or if that will be an internal battle he has to face Regardless I just hope they dont completely disregard his fathers impact
Timothe Chalamet has become an excellent actor with this and Dune Outstanding
I dunno The reason Roald Dahl never gave Willy Wonka much of a backstory is because he didnt need fleshed out one
Was this filmed before after or during he whored around with a Jenner
Black people as police in Britain in the days it was set  Very realistic
THANK GOD MAYBE WE CAN GET BACK INTO THE VIBES LIKE IN THE 1990s BLESS
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is legendary
From the producers of Harry Potter followed by solemn vow Immediately all the fan theroies about George Weasley came to mind I solemnly swear that I am up to no good
ooooph rough
absolutely admitting this Ill Put this on my movie list I cant wait till Dec15th
This is already looks so good I cant wait
After watching this I am now craving for a bag of chips
This is exactly what I need
""
Ooooh i cant wait to see this amazing magnificent im really looking forward to this
THEY HAVE THE HORRIBLE HISTORIES GUY THEY HAVE MATTHEW BAYNTON BEST MOVIE 1010 LOVE IT
i meani kinda like it b
This looks absolutely terrible 
 Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
this looks like its going to be so so bad
MR BEEEEEEAAAAAAANNNNNNNNN
Is it a musical
His dead eyes
Troye Sivan Should have played Wonka
Havent you noticed the names of these movies are getting shorter so that means the next one is going to be called W
I hope they include his dentist dad
"Gee no mention of the dentist father in the trailer


A good thing I think"
This is how they made MDMA
""
When I first saw the title in like please no not Another copy of a copy of a copy but this looks quite interesting OK WONKA
51000 downvotes for those who cant see them Weve had enough of this woke nonsense being shoved down our throats in movies
Who asked for this is a question Warner really need to start asking themselves
childhood memories 
"Omg This is going my fav movie period 

Respectfully Always

BWhovion"
Sprry but Timothy got wrongly cast His performance is not believable and hi looks misplace
Im not sold on the casting but we shall see 
"Willy Im having a hard time picking a name 
Cringe forced sidekick character
I know Wonka 
Mark my words"
Not another reboot There is only one Wonka and that was Gene Wilder PERIOD
I was skeptical right up until Hugh Grant as the Oompa LoompaSOLD
009
feels uncanny to the point where it feels forced hope they do justice to the original in post production
"This looks good I cant wait to watch it 

This trailer is probably what Disney thinks their liveaction trailers look like Let them continue to dream "
Trash
Looks good
NAH
This looks like a Family Guy cutaway  wow 
this might be good
I dont think Timothee is charismatic enough Or Johnny just casts too huge of a shadow
      
IS THAT THE TITANIC
I like Timothee as an actor however this role didnt feel right as I watched the trailer This definitely isnt a movie for me With a holiday release it should do well with kidsfamilies during the Christmas season I thinking family fun at best but not a genuinely good movie
Does anyone else think that Timothe Chalamet sounds like hes trying to be the next Eminem in this trailer when he says So quiet up and listen down Nope scratch that reverse it Just me 
The forced child sidekick character is kinda getting annoying and cliche as of recent but other than that this looks pretty solid
Why the heck do we have to remake everything Isnt anyone independently creative anymore
we are so happy for you Timothe and very proud of you
018 feels like an SNL character
"Chalamet is a great actor
But he was MISCAST as WONKA "
Why do the Oompa Loompas from an isolated island in the Hangdoodles have the accent of a British gentleman
Miss jhonny depp he would have been more suited for this role if he was some year younger 
estoy muy emocionada por esta pelcula
Looks too over the top cheesy Why the need to make it that way 
Omg I cant wait 
There is only one true Wanka and Gene is his name
Timothee Chalamet is too young and hot to play Willy Wonka
Trailer only drops 2 days ago  20k comments 318k likes in that short time   this movie is already magical  I cant wait to see it
"Why I see and hear Karl Jacobs to
him  Timothe Chalamet Cant wait to see this on December Yipee"
Did they just white wash the original material in the book I still wanna see it
"Looks interesting but Im not sure about the sidekick
Dont care what colour the skin may be Id be saying the same if it was white brown or sky blue
Im just not sure how they will insert a sidekick into what amounts to a prequel style film"
Not really feelin Timmy for this role 
103 Could this be Agatha Trunchbull Like a crossover between Roald Dahls Matilda and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
I think that the premises of this movie is for him to do this for his mom cousin trailer he says this here we go mama
Cant wait
charlie in the chocalate factory willy wonka still in my heart
Flip flop Skip Scott dipped off new op yeah  about as good as that
Cringe
Will Simon Farnaby show up as a raunchy security guard
A backstory for Gene Wilders wonka which we love to see my only hope is that a little light is shed on why wonka wanted to essentially teach the parents of the four bratty kids a lesson in parenting It looks like wonkas mother is in this which makes me think he didnt have a bad upbringing so maybe he thinks everyone should be raised in the same way he was I dont know but Im excited nonetheless
oompa loompas looks like a monster
Man Im going to see this movie in theaters
Chalamets acting range is insane
Looks good but does anybody think its odd that a musical movie is completely downplaying the music
The only doesnt make sense is how does he have black hair and then when he gets older he turns blonde its not how genetics work
Wow cant wait to watch it 
"This very much looks like a Christmas release Seems to have very little relation to the Dahl version aside from repurposing characters
Could be good but its definitely different I dont feel Chalamet has the right brand of a little off as Wilder or even Depp"
The guy playing Wonka sounds like he is reading a book to kids
ok this looks hella cute n fun XD
Harry Potter vibes 
Hugh Grant is like a fine wine he only gets better with age and him being cast in this film is proof of that
This is what Hollywood needed A back story not a remake  tired of those
Wow cant wait for this movie 
this looks fun
Mr Bean
Honestly its nice to see a heartwarming movie coming to theaters for a change I feel like the cast and crew had a lot of fun with Wonka
This feels like a movie with a soul
I have no idea why but I really like the feel for this movie Will definitely be watching
Looks stupid Im sure it will be a hit as there is no shortage of stupid people who will watch it
so suprisingly cant wait 
Why reboot something when the original was already good This is nothing like Roald Dahls book
We have to stop making movies
Booo Nobody asked for this Do something original
Hes getting slayed for this trailer and the performance looks good so far lol
Wonka character seems too wholesome he should be a showman but also unnerving
Im not watching it because Willy wonka isnt played by Jack Sparrow
VERUCA SALT YOU IN THIER
Okay but why does his acting remind of Daniel Thrasher being an absolute g00ber
What is the point of this movie We have had two versions of wonka already
"OMGOMGOMGOMGOKGOMGOMGOMGIMG
MY FAVOURITE PERSON WHO IS THE MOST ATTRACTIVE GUY EVER
MAT BAYNTON OMGGGGGG I AM SO WATCHING THIS FOR HIM "
timothee chalamet is was a bad choice hes trying too hard to be effortlessly whimsical
At first I thought I wouldnt like this But its looking good
"Dang Hughie first Honor Among Thieves and now this

Youre on a roll"
wheres the dentist father
This makes me feel like Ive been brought back to my childhood cant wait to watch this
WriterActor strike So what Theres nothing but bad remakes anyway
ITS THE ITS THE HOT HORRIBLE HISTORIES DUDE
BRO MR BEAN IS THERE IN 142
Looks really really stupid poorly written and poorly cast
I just dont think it looks good The original will never be topped
Oh my goodness I would love to watch this
dont feel like wonka
Timothe Chalamet has such wonderful range I cant wait to see what he does with Willie Wonka
This has got to be a joke right 
I saw mr bean 
I love Chalamet truly but nothing beats Depp playing Wonka 
first barbie now willy wonka Warner Bros is getting too good now 
Cant wait
This looks like dooky
I love  the willy Wonka the old one willy Wonka and the chocolate  factory better
Black    
Is this a Wonka Musical If it is lets do it 
this looks cute but not something Id actually watch
""
Nobody wanted this movie to exist
Looks ok but the child in this is miscast which brings down the film
This looks absolutely beyondI heard this was in production but the trailer exceeds my dreams of expanding the narrative for one of my favorite films of all time
Freak Brothers season 2 episode 1
No jdepp thats for sure
I hope the film is better than the trailer
Johnny Depp was the best
Should have cast danielle thrasher lol
See im something of a magician myself  Willem Dafoe Wonka
Flog a dead horse the first one was the only one
Why does Timothee look like Daniel Thrasher Am I the only one thinking this
The famous Willy wonka has finally made a good future appearance even though the movie was old19 he finally came back this Christmas
OH
As a fan of the original Wonka movie I am loving this already
Cant wait
Id bite it
Are new stories not a thing anymorei dont think jhonnys willy wonka will ever be beaten acting wise depp is just that good none of his roles could feel the same if it s not him as we can hardly dissociate them from him
This looks terrible
OMGIM GONNA WATCH THIS MOVIE But is this movie comes to Japan
Coming soon
No
should have been donald glover
Not being funny but this reminds me a lot of poorly written school plays They honestly should have stopped with the original movie but hey thats Hollywood for you grasping at straws for movie ideas and subsequently making themselves look bad They need to stop ruining things with what they think is new and improved as its just making them look desperate at this point
Why do I have extremely low expectations
May God bless you awesome and abundantly May you never no sadness Bcos you have put smile in many people mouth Keep blossoming
Is kinda sad in this movie it appears that Wonka is a beacon of progress antibureaucracy  hope But if it carries on like the original story hell be betrayed close the factory put people out of work after monopolizing the entire industry  will go crazyer until Charlie arrives anyway It is a hopefull movie with a hopeless end Kinda neat actually
WAS THAT MR BEAN
  
All that creativity and money yet every shot has the exact same lack of atmosphere and emotion
Remakes are getting ridiculous
I can see so many parodies of this already
Idk his voice is throwing me off
This looks fantastic
Awesome    I cant wait
A tad woke but has potential
""
Wonka got woke  Why does hollyweird have to woke everything they make
Its like theyre speaking in memes
Ch in this movie mr been spottted
Nah man Willy wonka aint that young he NEEDS to be a little older man
Timothee Chalamet is perfect for this role Im really excited for this movie
Whos forcing this guy Literally zero charisma
Meh Looks big budget without a soul
perfectt cast also from harry potter producers nice
More historical blackwashing 
If it didnt have the director from paddington Id just let this be one of the movies I completely forget about That being said still dont have that high of hopes for it
First of all Timothee Chamalet looks nothing like Johnny Depp hehe and second MATTHEW BAYHTON the Horrible History Hearthrob is starting in big blockbuster movies  so proud
Looks terrible Johnny depp did it the best 
045 reminds me of Daniel Trasher
Chalamet doesnt seem like a great fit seems like hes trying to hard to pull it off Everything and everyone else looks great
Im not sold  The original movie was such a draw imo  because Gene Wilder was so wackadoodle he was amazing mesmerizing  Timothee is just saying lines  Not good enough
I mean Paul King is directing this Im seeing it just off his name His Paddington movies were in the words of my favourite Doctor fantastic
Christmas  will  be  good  this  year
I wont lie when I imagine the first willy Wonka or the one from Charlie and the chocolate factory its hard to imagine them growing up like this and going thru this type of journey except for the going looking for oompa loompas since hes admitted himself he did it for that I kinda lost some of the hype I had for this film
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET GENTLEMEN
Johnny depp where are you  someone stole your character and where are the golden tickets for factory tour where are the kids somebody please find them where are the oompa loompas
Come with me and you will see a entire world of the pure imagination
"I wanted to hate on this but once I watched the whole trailer I honestly couldnt
Congrats Nepo baby no matter who our parents are we still have to have our own talents to get the gigs Timothee is quite adorable"
Terrible idea for a reremake Horrible casting with Tim Chalamethe is NO comparison to Johnny Depp when it comes to being quirky and odd and he doesnt have the sincerity of Gene Wilder in the role The supporting cast is more popular but I dont see that saving the filmHollywood is TRUELY out of ideas when they resort to putting out this kind of drivel
I had my reservations but this looks so sweet and nice and genuinely fun that I cant wait now
Oh shoot mr bean is in there say less
Im hungry for chocolate now
It actually looks delightful
He aint whimsical bruh 
This feels like watching myself try to do a Depp Willy Wonka in the mirror 
This finna be hot
Looks pretty good Please tell me it isnt a musical
I canKt believe Warner brothers is making the origin of Willy wonka
why do i feel like the comments are fake hahahah
Very excited to see this film
Wonka is quite deserving of a backstory himself the man has always been a wonder makes you want to know his past
the original song from the first movie is awesome
blacks
We must be running out of ideas 
This would be perfect
They couldnt cast a real Oompa loompa In 2023
Yep thats what happens when you dont even make him rehearse and just give him the part They really did that 
OMG HOW MANY TIMES ARE THEY GOING TO REMAKE THIS MOVIE 
No just no just no
This looks terrible Ill pass
So shines a good deed in a weary world  Willy Wonka 1971 Theyre bringing the spirit of the first film back and Im totally on board
Oh this looks like its going to be popular
theres no need for cgi for loompas
idk not timothy 
Diversity and cheap CGI
AAAAAAAA I LOVE HIM SM 3333
Okay this looks a lot better than I thought it would be Paul King is great Watch this space
Timothy is the right choice 
The supporting role casting is actually crazy good 5050 on chalamet hopefully the girl is good child actor though so would be unknown either way
Ahh damn ion gone lie they just ruined this shiii for me it looks so goofy no lie
No
looks like rubbish
maza nhi aaya
"Warner Bros
It will be another woke bullsht "
Put the whole movie in the trailer then wonder why people dont go see it and wait for streaming
UMMM WHY IS KNOW ONE TALKING ABOUT MATTHEW BAYNTON
its so bad 
047 around this timestamp I cant unsee that this is Daniel Thrasher
OMG this is so fitting I love u Timothe
This doesnt seem interesting 
""
Cant wait to watch this
Hey Johnny Depp did a cosplay of him to me
We got a black girl instead of a white poor boy nowinteresting
This looks trash
pgn nonton
Ill have an everlasting jawbreaker All you need is one
Might be interesting To be sure it will be very politically correct
    
This over cringy Barbie anyday
So excited to watch this
I wish it was Charlie and the chocolate factory A continued story of his own adventure of how he now runs the chocolate factory then have Willy really old but  still advising Charlie
Im so sorry but I dont think anything will top Johnny Depps version
Fortunately between this and the Wikipedia plot review I dont have to actually watch this film  If I am going to spend any time in this cinematic universe it will be watching Gene  RIP
      
Nope
This film looks like a total mess ngl
WHOS WONKING THERE WILLY RIGHT NOW
Timothy has been in some of the greatest movies I loved little women and I know Im going to love this one
This looks terrible They should have cast Jeremy Allen as Willy Wonka Jeremy Allen looks like a younger version of Gene Wilder the original Willy Wonka and hes a great actor
A Waste
208
This looks terrible
Johnny Depp is BEST Wonka
Go Woke Go Broke this looks like a movie that is trying to hard to be inclusive and destroying one of my childhood favorite movies FFS stop destroying classics
Johnny Depp did it better but I get it There is money to be made
Hollywood quota met 
some white saviourism complex it looks like but still interesting
AWESOME  
For some reason I like this adaptation Something magical Christmasy  about it Cant wait
Am I the only one who feels like someday they should make a Great Glass Elevator movie
Oh hey another movie nobody asked for Im sure the studio will get a fat tax rebate when it flops
""
"Missing jhony deppy 
Y yy jhonny is willy wonkanot TC"
Leeeetttts Gooooooo
I love you Timothee
""
Wonka would not have a black assistant  he didnt in 1971  its improbable
this is going to be so good omg
And as u said WONKA Johnny Depp Wonka face came to my mind 
"This looks abysmal
Roald Dahl must be spinning in his grave
Hollywood truly is out of ideas"
Merry Christmas Everyone
The fabulous rich fulcher is supposed to be in this somewhere
Timothee chalamet film are the best
125m dollar budget This is gonna flop so hard and Im sad about that
Lol the Oompa Loompa was a must 
WHAT 0
Dune part three already it looks more joyful though
Words cannot express how excited I am for this Willy Wonka holds holds a very special place in my heart Even though he isnt a real he inspired me to pursue my love of baking and pastry Cannot wait
Amazing trailer Cant wait to see it The only disappointment is the Umpa Lumpa not for the amazing actor but i was expecting the classic sqeecky voice and the lovely Umpa Lumpa dwarfism look  Is something that i adore in the original movie and in my opinion is what give them sparks i hope i didnt offend nobody with that comment but i mean it in the best way as possible
i cannot wait for dec 15
I was waiting for the lgbtq moment I see theyve learned there lesson on not putting it on the trailer  Ill bet money Willy comes out in this movie
Not sure if I have ever been less intrigued to see anything in my life this looks bad to say the very least
Everything has to always be so dramatic in these movies 
A wonka origin Never expected this
As usual the term diversity is only used for one ethnic group Why is it always like this in all the movies
I wish the new actor would have done a voice more like Gene Wilders voice for Willy Wonka but hes clearly mimicking Johnny Depps take What a shame especially given that they went back to the old Oompah Loompah designs Gene Wilders Wonka was more down to earth while still having a wild and unpredictable emotional range when needed That would have been much better
wow YES YES
Cant wait 
"Were gonna get fun and whimsical thats a must but I hope we get to see where his DARKNESS comes from too It makes sense that Johnny Depp would be emotionally abused by his overbearing and unsupportive father Christopher Lee but Im not sure Im seeing THIS Wonka taking people down The Scary Tunnel and threatening the safety of his prepubescent guests

Well well well two naughty nasty little children gone Three good sweet little children left"
love it
ada mr beannn
One question Why
This movie is being directed by the people who made pattington and the Harry Potter movies how is this not gonna fail
I love how its based before the original charlie and the chocolate factory with gene webber as wonka
Why did the moment he said here we go Mama bring on some unexpected emotions that I did not see coming That felt deep 
Im sorry but i hated it when he said scratch that reverse it  How old is this kid
TIMOTHEE AND WILLY WONKA NO WAYYY
""
But why Hollywood has truly run out of ideas
Well someones got to say it It really is amazing how many Africans were in Europe in the old days They were everywhere policemen politicians rich people etc etc To bad they couldnt find a vertically challenged person to play the Ooopa Loompa Honestly the decay of modern movies is incredible Thank goodness I am old enough to have lived through the good and bad movies of the past 100 years
7 years
Hoooowdy Ho
Might be pretty good I got surprised by Oz the Great and Powerful
When I saw this trailer on tv I knew within the first 10 seconds they would name the movie Wonka lol
He looks like Freddie Highmore who played charlie in 2005 film in this movie 
Tim Tim aint no Gene
Theres always that one token character
idk still a fan of Johnny depps role as Willy Wonka 
MrBean
I think this actually looks rather fun and I trust the makers of Paddington implicitly to handle this with care and integrity That being said this does feed even more into the idea that Hollywood is absolutely bankrupt of original ideas and creativity
Hollywood is truly lucky to have himhe born to be a 
The fact that we get to see Willy Wonka as the child he passed his factory down to before he got old and jaded  Charlie and not the chocolate cartel man he became is going to be amazing This is why WIlly passed his factory on to Charlie because he still had the imagination and wonder that he had and lost
Now we know the secret of Wonka Chocolates big flavour the use of melange
What happened to Johnny Depp 
Wasnt that person that blew like a kiss The original mom from the remake of Charlie on the chocolate factory
Ohh an origin story I do not like the sound of that Looks like a great cast though and I may see this Shame they couldnt get a British actor to play Wonka for once but he certainly looks the part
So diverse
For me Johnny Depp wil be the best Willy Wonka
"Well theres certainly the obligatory OTT diversity quota of characters as as expected I really was expecting a race or genderswapped Wonka too it was a surprise to see it wasnt the case  they kept Wonka white and although its still very obviously diversity checkbox driven as far as casting goes shame  its going to be orders of magnitude better than if Disney had got hold of itI actually might go and see thisMIGHT

Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is a stroke of genius though"
Ahsoka trailer this mid
cant wait for this
Alice in Wonderland vibe 
Looks awful The usual false diversity inserted everywhere Britain did not look like that  nor does it today
MR BEAN
on my birthday yooooo
Cant wait
Uhmm I Guess Hes Harley From Mobile Legends Bang Bang 
Why isnt Johnny playing in it
Obvious WOKE casting and Timothy Chalamet obviously cant play wonka Looks AWFUL Will not be paying for this
Couldnt they have just left the original alone 
"naaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh
NO WONKA WITHOUT DEPP MAN"
Hollywood studios theatrical film releasesremakes sequels prequels reboots Pumping out garbage over and over again
Looks very soulless
125 why does he look like Carl from the mr beast crew
Ok now the OompaLoompa sold it to me
Allan Johnson for the win only reason Ill watch
This looks so so wrong Timothy may be the perfect Paul Atreides but he is certainly no Willy Wonka and this trailer does little to convince me that he has the devious charm or naturally playful charisma the role requires Yeah Hughs gonna make an adorable Oompa Loompa and the Paddington films were delightful so maybe Im wrong I just thinks its weird casting for a backstory movie we probably didnt need
I can see another warner bros flop here
I tought its remake but i think its adventure before won Ka have factory
Another dud from hollywood
who up wonking they willy
Wow really  Just saturate us with reboots No creativity anymore
John depp had the best wonka
Willy Wonka So hear me out what if we employed hundreds of midgets and paid them slave wages in cocoa beans
Just what we wanted another reboot No  but really it looks awful and whoever did this should feel awful
I just dont feel the latinx community is fairly represented in the movie 
Michael scott is the true willi wonka why Timothy is impersonating him 
i miss johnny depp 
If theres no blueberry inflation scene Not interested
does anyone know the soundtrack of the trailer
"When I first heard of this I was skeptical it seemed like a lazy ideasubstitute for a Great Glass Elevator movie

After seeing this trailer Im genuinely curious to see this

Question is is this supposed to be a prequel to the original book The Gene Wilder movie The Johnny Depp movie Can it possibly work for all 3"
Wowthis looks so terrible 
Waiting for Johnny depp cameo in this movie
hes so cute
to be fair this doesnt look  like the book not sure and its more bad than the old movie
Nooooooooooo
009
WINKY DINKER AND THE FLINKY DONKER
Daniel thrasher would be the perfect willy wonka
""
Was afraid this was going to be another remake but glad to see them doing a prequel instead Tbh though not really feeling Timothy C as Wonka but Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa is a stroke of genius lol
This actor is good ngl but in my heart Johnny Depp is the willi wonka
Mr Bean
What about Charlies grandpa Or Willys dentist dad
Now this is a trailer You dont know how many times i replayed this xd
"Everything good started with a dream 
 a certain guy from Austria in the 30s"
"Now we have three Wonkas
Wilder Depp and Chalamet"
this look sweet and heartwarming and silly and smart hope its all balanced
"Brazilian language in my Channel

Em portugus no meu canal DUBLADO"
Wellat leastthe right color
Whats great about this is I can see a sequel already
Willy Woke and the Pandering Factory
Wow this sucks so bad
Johnny depp was better
hope they make the original  with Jeremy Allen White
I think these kinds of visuals are why we go to the movies
lamea third remake for diversity
Unmmm why Why they made another one 
Never thought Id live to see Willy Wonkas backstory
Hehe
I adore Timothy Chalamet Its nice to see hes in a lot of diverse roles Seems like a tear jerker tbh Cant wait to see it
Gene Wilders embodiment of the true spirit of Wonka will always be my favorite
they really out here filling that diver quota to the max level
Looks great
We will be watching
when did they recast the lead role to nic cage
I love that movie and Paddington Harry Potter is part of Waner Brothers i thing is a yes
Oh man another Willy Wonka tale the third one signs that Hollywood cant come up with a new idea What are you going to stop at number 10 like the Fast and the Furious
A film we did not need
garbage
No hate but he looks like a Charlie
is this the prequel of the OG charlie and the chocolate factory
Chalamet actually lookin like he might knock this out of the park
Blockbuster 
Looks great
"019 Im makin chocolate uh course reminds me of Jasper saying battle scars  in Twilight lmaooooo 
This seems cute tho"
Is this young Johnny Depps Wonka or Gene Wilders Wonka
   
i hate this even more than i thought i would lol
Everything about it looks perfect except the guy playing Wonka  he seems so unenthusiastic  I think it will be a nice movie though 
THIS IS SO BAD
Really dont like Timothee casted as Wonka I really hope he proves me wrong
Definitely a better Wonka than Deep played Deep just came off creepy and weird TM comes off fun and interesting to watch
This is what happens when you give the lead role of your movie to someone who hasnt even auditioned for the role
Daniel thrasher
Reminder for December 16th create WONKADune supercut
I guess we really are stuck with the same 5 movies tv shows and Videogames being recycled every 10 years forever Instead of new things
Didnt Johnny depp played this character not too long ago
NAHH NOT THE FAKE COMMENTS
20000 and 1th comment
Pretty sure there wasnt that much diversity in an early 1900s police force
Why his muse gotta be sum coloured piece 
How many variations of this are we gonna GET
Am I the only one who thinks this looks awful and contrived And now we are about to be beat over the head with butchered Dahl films And that the trailer is being flooded with repeated BOT comments
boys planet fans know ollie is going crazy rn
I am not sold in this dude as Willy Wonka at all His acting isnt very good I dont give a f u c k if youre a fan just my opinion
2hour long trailer
It is mrbean at 101 and 141
I AM SO EXCITED THIS IS ACTUALLY FOR ONCE A GOOD PREQUEL THING
You dont understand how this trailer brought me to tears The childhood memories my inner child is overjoyed Can wait for this to be out
just a small group of ppl defying th laws of physics
How Willy became Wonka Great quote
Definition of uninspiring
Paul Atreides is Wonka The Oompa Loompaz Haderach
The director of Paddington ok im in those films were fun
No
2 movie was perfect not another remake
A bit too much of a Fantastic Beasts vibe coming from thisughh 
Lo hermoso que se ve esta pelcula y lo maravilloso que se ve timothe me llena de emocin
Another remake
What about Wonka father
TIMOTHY WAS CAST WITHOUT AN AUDITION I hope you all see this so you understand why he is horrible in this depiction Also the director passed on Donald Glover for that child in a suit This universe is no fun
Does this casting choice mean there have been many many oompaloompa romantic comedies we have never and will never see
"From Dune to Wonka
The Chocolate must flow"
This looks horrible
Not a third willy wonka film FFS nothing beats the first one
I cant stop watching this trailer It just warms my heart so much The visuals the MUSIC the magic and the warmth of timothy chalamets acting It gives me chills thinking about my childhood and how Gene Wilders willy wonka and the chocolate factory is an timeless movie This is a family movie we have been waiting for and i cant wait to share it with my family this christmas Thank you Warner Bros 
Finally we can see the slavery recruitment scene of the Oompa Loompas
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 30
142 Great to see Rowan Atkinson as a Priest again 
"Pure imagination 100
Golden ticket 100
Wonka bar 100
Chocolate 100

It Must Be Believed To Be Seen
"
Omg Im so excited for the movie
Hard pass
I laughed sooo hard at the Oompa Loompa  Now that was great casting Not sure about the rest of the movie tho Especially Timothee  he doesnt have the weird chaotic energy Gene Wilder had as Wonka or charm Hes too soft spoken and everything seemed forced and unnatural
Im not wasting my time  
I have never clicked this fast ever
I cant see this Willy turning into Gene wilders take not insane enough
This has all the energy of the original movie It actually looks really good
no
No No thank you
To be honest the trailer was good but I didnt think it was necassary to have the OompaLoompas look like as they did in the 1971 film They werent described as that but originally as small little blackcolored pygme people Edit Also to mention us that I dont think it was really necessary to have the prequel follow the Gene Wilder version of Wonka if that is what they are planning on doing with it I mean I dont hate it but I dont think neither Felicity DahlRoald Dahls widowhis children nor Roald Dahl would appreciate the idea of a prequel He would most likely disapprove of it and would be rolling around in his grave to be brutally honest Johnny Depp at least made it right with the better script writing acting director and film makers overall were better If youre planning on writing a prequel story or even a book adaptationthen youd better stick as close to the source material as possible if even possible when doing one But if I may be honest with you all this movie does has potential in my eyes I myself view myself to be different while also being diagnosed with autism I tend to see myself as an eccentric person with having wild creative ideasbut nowhere as near as Willy Wonka God I wish I could be that wildly creative God would know that
Lets gooo Lil mabus first movie
Looks absolutely terrible Warner Brothers sucks 
willy wonka is prussianthis is canon
The actors alone sold me
The oompa loompas cgi doesnt look too great but I hope at least it has a good story
This will be forgettable
MrBean
This honestly looks pretty good Excited to see another movie from the mind of Rhode Dahl
What a cool trailer bro
"no thank you good day sir
i said good day to you sir"
Im appreciative of everyones positive responses but the first movie was gold I think we all know by now you cant remake something that was already done perfect
There should be a horror movie about this
giving me The Greatest Showman vibes based off the music  but this looksactually good
Do I sense some promotional candy 
Watttt
if a movie contains black people its woke  this comment section
Bros turning people into giraffes with his chocolate
people have a hard on with this guy for some reason sorry but hes miscast here wonka is supposed to be nutty and eccentric that line delivery at the beginning was so forced and cringe
scratch that reverse it nctzens iykyk
This is setting my expectations so high Its an origin story Make it right make it happen
Love Johny Depp
Are we continually going to have a Willy Wonka adaptation every 1015 years 
Looks perfect for Christmas Im sick of dark twisted vampire movies This looks fun and joyful  and Timothe is good in everything he does Cant wait to see this
uuhm no thank you
Okay heres the thing Its not a cash grab and its trying to be good The thing its doing wrong is that their making the towns folk to goofy He said No daydreaming as a law which is silly but the thing that the original showed us was the compare and contrast from the real world and the chocolate factory If we cant differentiate which one is more nonsensical then the tone of the movie wont work Willys character for the most part looks fine The only thing hes missing is his cruel sarcasm from the movie Remember when the German child was drowning and his mother is begging Willy to do something and Willy goes Help police
Why isnt Willy Wonka black I thought all rebooted movies are supposed to have the lead character be black now or a woman Do we really need another white male led reboot
My favourite part was when he said Its Wonking time and wonked his Willy all over the place An absolutely fantastic movie
A community theaterlevel impersonation of Gene Wilder  sigh
Nope  No  Looks awful
Took away the job away from midgets The only work they could get regularly from Hollywood and replaced it with a CGI guy in a jar lol Well aint that a waste of money lol Yet looks like an interesting film
Timothy is a total miscast hes a horrible Willy Wonka
Good video
No just no
Im getting some Mary Poppins Returns vibes from this
So  Chocolate  Flubber  Chubber 
This looks terrible
idk if its just me but from the looks of the trailer it looks like timothee chalamet doesnt have the right whimsymagic for the role  it looks like its missing something
WB needs to advertise more its a prequel  NOT a remake bc that is the big complaint 
This feels like a wholesome take on the franchise For children and their families to enjoy it releases 10 days before Christmas afterall
"A movie no one asked for and no one will end up seeing 

Enjoy your losses guys"
This looks god damn amazing
Willy wonka always seemed a little scary This gentleman doesnt seem to have that Ill hold criticism until i see the film
I was ready to hate it but left feeling a bit giddy for this instead Looks like they may have done a good job on this
AHEIGNBDIRKVBDO I AM SO EXCITED
"Also featuring Kim Kardashian as one of the test subjects for the chocolate that makes you float
 When trying it she successfully left the floor rising into the air but she also inflated and expanded hugely into all directions like a giant hot air balloon
 So then they fixed the formula so people could float with more space around them"
Nice
I didnt think Id get to see an third installment of Wonka in my lifetime Im 72 years old and I will be watching this film at the theaters
The chocolate must flow
Very excited Are you
Haha I was skeptical to see this until I saw Hugh Grant as oompa loompa now I need to see it
Ive been avoiding this trailer but now Im pretty excited to see this movie 
Awh a main character who reps my last name gang type shi
If Harry Potter Had A Chocolate Story
I wish gene wilder could have seen this 
there is something weird happening in the comments  I have seen more than 10 seemingly innocent comments  with explicit profile images  corn  I think it is intentional as a lot of children and teenagers will be watching this trailer and reading the comments  please report and watch out 
Leave it alone lol
Its goofy but it actually feels like an older movie like something from my childhood
Oh god no just no
I wonder what this one is about 
Come on cant you come up with something new
Absolute trash
Oh My I didnt know danielthrasher was playing as the next Willy Wonka
Sweet Jesus is there no creativity left in the world are people so dull that this is what they want to go see remake after remake after remake after remake after remake Most of these movies are just formulas lowest common denominator formulas
Omg orange ompaloompas 
The trailers been getting a lot of hate but i think it looks good
"This looks awful and is far from the original books
Another bomb because nobody asked for it"
this looks shockingly OK
103 i think the guy is Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean
"Whos taking bets that this will be a woke remake that trashes the original or its creators effort
I see the diversity quota
I see the switching of the oompa loompa and wonka meeting story
I see it not meshing with the cannon story with the fact he makes people fly in public as well as meeting the oompa loompas before he has his factoryif following the original film the factory was manned by people then later shut down for the oompa loompas to take over
I have no faith in this at all"
i already know this is going to be so good i cant wait for it to come out i may watch it 100 times when it does come out
This seems good but nothing beats the original Willy Wonka movie
Is this a prequel or a reboot
Im sorry but I like Timothe Chalamets acting here Im new to Willy Wonka but I like what I see sooo
Is this wonkas back story or charlie becoming Willy
Looks lame like most movies today
Nothing to see here  Just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity
I do not appreciate this at all
Historically accurate as usual
Mr Carson is going to shut this all down
But Who Aaked For This
I bet one of those vials holds the secret to the creation of CW7
Johnny Depp was such a good Willy Wonka
This is not the right casting for him
Sigh looks like white boy Charlie Bucket has been race and gender swapped Gee never saw that coming
RIP Gene Wilder  Makes me appreciate the original SO much more now  Not eccentric enough Timothee   Truth
So far Timothees Wonka feels like Jared Letos Joker 
Use me as a Dislike button
this looks so bad
Looks like it could have been good
might be good
How many times am I gonna see a willy Wonka reboot in my life time And nobody is gonna beat gene wilder
Love Actually Reunion with Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson
Looks like a WOKE remake of one of my favorite movies
Wow his acting in this seems very odd and off and not in a charismatic manic say
Again
December 15 Thats a long way to go Some of you people will have to respond to my comment after having seen the movie and telling me how it was It looks like something that will appease my younger child for sure but I dont know if I could watch it and enjoy it This is a younger Wonka than in that old movie from the 70s right In that regard it seems the society got worse as Wonka got older Shouldnt it have been the other way around Wonder if they bring that up in this movie or the sequel that will come later
I see you Key I see you Trying to be the most annoying  hateable character arent you Hurrmm
Here we go mama
What a colorless movie  Its so drab
Audience gonna be 30 year olds mostly 
The guy playing Willy wonka is horrible His acting is garbage This has potential they just messed up with the main actor It looks horrible 
Was anybody else getting Snowpiercer vibes from this trailer Just wondering
In this he seems like a good guy but in the original movie didnt he torture a bunch of kids to death
More woke remakes sigh
How many remakes must be remade Can we get something new and original please Please Please
10 DAYS BEFORE CHRISTMAS 
HUGH GRANT HUGH GRANT PLEASE Hes gonna steal the movie I hope he doesnt fk up this moment a second opportunity like he did when he first became an idol after Four Weddings and a Funeral
First Solo now this Why hire a softie to play an outgoing character
Wow you can tell right away that Timothee has nailed this role Great casting
Who knew young Timmy Tim would play Wonka one day
Now I want chocolate
not even a terrible concept but why timothee chalamet lmao
ahaa Mr Bean is also here
""
Needed Liz Hurley in a bikini as the MILF
Looks STUPID 
Thats crazy
Why is there a kid side kick
Cant wait
Scar wore it better
Wow finally a magical movie that worth to wait for and watch I think it has been years since we have this kind of magical concept movie I already love the casts
SKIP
Why does it have to be whats his name playing willy wonka I feel like they couldve done better but hey Ill take it
Oh dear 
Very Old World of you Warner Bros
Why did I read that as wanka
Watch out Johnny Depp here comes Oh never mind
Are we going to see Johnny Depp again I hope so
I dont have to watch it
This looks fcking stupid All the bots are the only ones saying this is good are also stupid
Looks good Please dont be woke Please
Na man johnny depp is the OG
So many stars omg
DID I JUST SAW MR BEAN 
Looks awful
Hes not weird enough and genuine
Was that Rowan Atkinson running away
Not sure why they needed to make another Willy
not sure i like what i am seeing i like the idea of it but some of the acting in the trailer seems a bit too much
""
The main character is a terrible terrible actor This movie looks stupid af
I dont know in anything else Id be excited for a new plot of a reboot but I kinda wish it was just the original plot with better acting and effects I gotta see 2023 blueberry girl
With a little child the whole time bruhhh
If its gonna be a musical i aint watching it
I watched the whole trailer thinking that it was Aaron Taylor Johnson 
Lets watch this movie then we could have a conclusion if its really connected to Snowpiercer 
This looks gayer than cruisin
Ill be honest the only one Ive seen that really made this style of filming Choose big character thats backstory is a mystery somewhat interesting was Alice in Wonderland and Cruella This is not to say this movie will be bad but I wonder how its gonna be There is already the trope of random character that is never mentioned in the original story with the little girl but perhaps she will be a really good memorable new character if written well What yall think
You had me at MrBean Hugh Grant this looks great
I just feel like SO MUCH is shoved in this trailer I get lost  but hopefully it is a good watch 
Why is no one talking about Mr Mosbey being in this movie 
Why  Just Why  Can Hollywood not come up with any original ideas anymore
Im almost a believermaybe if I watch the trailer one more time
"Gene Wilder  the best Willy Wonka

Johnny Depp  The exact version of Willy Wonka from the book"
Stop making remakes of already great films toss off please and make new stuff
This looks fun Cant wait to see it
"Another movie no one asked for saw enough of Wonkas backstory in the strange Johnny Depp version
More forced diversity in a filmtime period where it doesnt make sense 1st Wonka had no diversity but suddenly a film that takes place prior it looks like modern day LA In a time period and location of the world where there was no diversity Make it make sense
Another beloved character that is miscast I like this actor but you need a very specific type of charisma to replicate Gene Wilder

No thanks"
Looks way better than that Johnny Depp trainwreck
Hmm not sure how I feel about it but Ill give a watch
The original was subtlety dark and this is for children Kind of bummed tbh And the timothy kid doesnt quite fit the role
Every character Ive seen Timothe Chalamet play is usually softspoken and reserved  so its kind of odd to see him in an energetic role like this At the end of the day though It looks like a cute lighthearted familyfriendly flick that peoplell take their kids to during the holidays Wouldnt be surprised if it ended up doing really well
I love Timothy Chalamet but I think this is a big miscast
I like it It does seem to have that same Roald Dahl Fairytale style
I like the bit where they gave him an American accent
Woke Willy Wonka
Woke cast
it looks okay
ITS FANTASTICSPECTACULAR AND AMZING MOVIEE IS GOOD
Here we go Mama TEARS
Suddenly theres black people all over Victorian England  Please stop with the tarring of history
MR BEAN
Good lord that looks awful
wheres Johnny Depp
This is gonna bomb another example of not allowing a half decent IP to rip
Marcus Lam likes Willy wonka so he will like this scene  205 Oompaloompa Too late Ive started dancing now Once weve started we cant stop
Finally it is a true classic prequel that is released on Christmas  Feels like the 90s
Another insignificant happy story Thats disappointing
WOW OMG an origin story about Willy Wonka sounds really interesting I really want to see this movie
I can not be the only person that just wanted Gene Wilder deep faked as a younger man instead I mean its not like they dont have the technology to do it
Ill really enjoy wonkin my willy to this movie someone I know 
what even
Scratch that reverse it stolen from Jim Carey
This gave me goosebumps
well obviously if your gonna have a movie about a coco factory your gonna need coco people s
You can try and try but just nothing is gonna touch the version with Gene Wilder
are        all of them gonna be hugh grant
"now this is a movie I can look forward to Movies rarely do that now

I like how they decided to go with the original oompa Loompas"
Gene wilder still the best and always will be
Looks so good 
""
Awesome 
This movie will attract all ages from the early movie to the one in the 2000s A Idea
Looks like Fantastic Beasts wardrobe at the banks
Finally a Willie Wanka movie that doesnt give me the creeps 
Gene Wilder 
The song reference 
The first willy Wonka movie will always be my favorite
Is that the same guy from dune
Maybe they used the word scratch instead of strike because they dont want to acknowledge the writer strike
Looks a bit flat and dull Like how Disney are churning out remakes for profiteven though theyre loosing money instead 
102 omg is it mr bean
MrBeast made great version
I wanna see this movie in the winter
Looks Pretty Good Not Gonna Lie 
Who up wonking they willy
Im so excited for this and happy that Timothe is getting a chance to act in a movie like this cause he is SUCH a beautiful actor and really is an allfilms type actor so this is amazing for him and Timothe fans me 
Is this  better than the  with Johnny Depp
folks I am detecting dangerous levels of boyish whimsy in this one
Shows too much in a trailer
""
Did I see the mother from the second Willy Wonka movie
Love how magical this feels
"Magic  chocolate  108
Until the police  chief gained Weight 130"
LOOKS ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE  trying to mimic the Great Gene Wilderhahhaa yeah right
Without Johnny depp there is no Pirates  Wonka  
Amazing they have managed to make 3 films out of this story
All these new reboots of classics seem to focus on the most boring parts of the entire concept I dont give a flip who Willy Wonka dated Tell me more about the OompaLoompaverse or something Seems like the obvious play considering how huge Minions is But no I guess it will be fun to watch Willy Wonka apply for a bank loan with his wife
STOP DOING THIS
Yeah no
No and no
Hear me out Willy is a wizard just like Harry Potter Explains the magic candy anyways 
Looks awful
why do i feel like ive heard of too many willy wonka reboots in the past 8 years is that just me or
No Willy Wonka is set in the normal mundane world his magic is meaningless if set in Tim Burton magicy world Just make something original if you wanted to tell this story This is ChatGTP levels of not understanding the original material
What about the oompa loompas
Its Timothy chamalmala
by the views of this trailer alone omg imagine the revenue of warner bros just for this trailer alone
Why is this movie getting so much hate It doesnt even look bad
210 The computer animation of the Oompa Loompa body looks SO bad This is a cartoon character with a human head pasted on top
This does not add up
This feels magical I hope it is 
I wish Michael Cera was Willy Wonka such a weirdo
Im sick of kids movies that are marketed to adults
NO ONE TOLD ME THIS FILM WAS BEING MADE
Hollywood needs to stop casting timothee chalamet
Hmm theres too many Dark Chocolates in this film for my tastes
He very cute young man
Good to see Timotee Chalamet going into childrens fantasy stories such as Willy Wonka This may be an interest prequel origins story
i was skeptical about yet another willy wonka film but i think im going to watch this
Youd think that Britain was 13 black based on Hollywood movies
People you cant compare a grown person with their younger self This is a young Willy Wonka who eventually grows into the Gene Wilder Wonka
The fabulous Willy Woka 
Needs more black people and mystery meat individuals I will not be watching
looks cute
Anyone whos not a bot doesnt give a damn about Willy Wonkas origin story Have you tried making something new instead of a sequel or would you rather just keep letting AI write your movies
This looks terrible
Why make another
Im really hoping that because of this movie we see Wonkas name on candy again
""
Roald Dahl would be so proud of his work
Nothing can beat the performance that Johnny Depp brought Sorry
It would be better if it was Charlie buckets grown up when he took over the factory
Looks terrible
Can we not put KeeganMichael Key in every second movie
This looks terrible  like why is the acting so so so so bad  corny
I think its gonna failI dont why Hollywood keeps making reboots of classics they just ruined one of a past time favorites
"Short answer  No
Long answer  No"
Can we have a movie without a side character who is diverse or female and is so irrelevant  but just placed there for the sake of it
Im sure itll be fun but hes really not quirkycreepy enough to play Wonka even if it is meant to be a prequel
This looks like something that came straight out of a Disney live action film
You cant say no to a movie with Mr Bean in it chsnge my mind
PLEASE no WOKE 
This young actor seems to be taking inspiration from the Gene Wilder interpretation rather than Johnny Depps I like Depp but Wilder was the definitive Wonka
Seems more like Johnny Depps Wonka than Gene Wilders Wonka that is a problem
Ill pass You know why
the twinkification of willy wonka
Hip hip Cheerio
Ill only watch the movie if you sponsor MrBeast
it a leftist plot to brainwash are kids go to texas yall get away from this woke madness
Ok this looks better than the clips I saw on TikTok I was very worried 
Before covid I was casted as Mr Wonka in a local theater that helps children with disabilities all over ohio When the virus hit they had to cancel the show seeing this announcement made me tear up a little bit
hollywood really running out of ideas  the best wonka will always be gene wilder
MrBeast did it better
This looks so genuine and magical love it
How many times can you remake a movie before you decide its time to use your own imagination
Could Hollywood please invest in an original and new story thank you But nope lets play it safe boys and remake old movies
Awesome
I usually dont care too much about acting but this was really bad He doesnt fit the character at all And the forced divesity took out any little immersion I had in this
Only watching this to see Hugh grant Oompa Loompas idc
goat
The Quiet up listen down line was delivered so bad but apart from that the movie looks good tbh
I love the pure imagination background  its very nostalgic and brings back memories from when I was a wee lad Ill definitely be checking this out 
This does not look good
bots comments Warner brothers ok
pc ships sinks thank god
"Love that they went prequel and chose to try to bring the whimsy of the original movie vs the insanity of the remake

Love Tim burton and Johnny but I feel they pushed too hard for the odd vs the imagination 

Plus having Mr Bean doing anything in your movie is always a good idea  

Make Gene Wilder proud"
Excuse me but was that Rowan Atkinson
"Mr Burns Have Harry Styles killed
Smithers But Sir that isnt
Mr Burns Do as I say"
Here comes another Woke reboot monstrosity to rewrite great childhood classics
Def excited to see this
It looks good but I dont see Willy Wonka I see Timothee Chalamet acting if that makes sense But he can prove me wrong 
This is brilliant One note though the Oompa Loompa CGI really needs work Theres still time I hope they can fix it
Its not giving What it is supposed to give lol
This is honestly so exciting
I saw the actor for mrbean so Im 100 watching it
""
The reinterpretation of the theme song from the 1971 movie that this is a prequel of almost made tears swell into my eyes when it starts playing at around 129  Saw that movie so many times as a kid Love it
I think he would be the only choice for this role good job 
Looks like a big steaming pile of WOKE   
This guy cannot act
JOHNSON
This looks amazing I cant wait
I swear man I think ppl give this kid WAY WAY WAY TOO MUCH credit for his acting  I dnt believe him  tbh this looks like straight up trash 
I feel like I would be more interested in it if they did the factory  opening  again  because it would be better
Timothy Chamolets acting is like child in a primary school play
This is too clean and too twee for Willy Wonka No dark side Plus Wonka doesnt like children so a load of balls On the plus side Hugh Grant will steal every scene again
This kid is the most pushed untalented trustfund kid from Hollywood Ive ever seen He SUCKS Shouldve just left it with Depp
He has absolutely no personality in this role whatsoever He looks like he just read the Scripps put the costume on and went out there and just tried to wing it Im sorry but I have never seen Timothe Chalamet this horrible
who asked for this
Feminism and affirmative action at work with the secondary lead
Why I hear One Piece trailer HAHAH
I guess you couldnt come up with another movie idea so you just make an already classic movie and ruin it
Depp is better
"Once we start dancing wr cant stop

 well not until the child is suctioned rolled dropped or grabbed offscreen"
Im excited
This is the prequel to Charlie and the chocolate factory
149 this little part of the trailer was perfect really gives the larger than life quality
Im not feeling this Wonka the accent  mannerisms might be too American compared to the other actors
So wonka is in England and a magician Really
"When I was about 10 was introduced to the first Willy Wonka original movie 
In my twenties watched the Willy Wonka movie with Johnny Depp Now married in my midthirties and about 4 months pregnant I must watch  "
This looks amazing i cant wait to see it 
Ill be honest I didnt think it would be very good After watching the trailer I am interested in it
Wow This looks great 
""
More work drivel let the boycotts continue 
the secret ingredient is crime
"Honestly the most boring actor Ive ever seen 

Tell me one movie he was outstanding Ill wait 

This probably has to be the first he might change his persona"
Lmao all the conservative snowflakes crying at the fact that a film with literal magic has black people its unrealistic now
141 Rich Fulcher
This movie is gonna flop so hard cant wait to see it tank at the box office whoever thought this actor had the chops for this flick needs to be sodomized and fired
Okay legit why does this got so many dislikes This movie looks really good
Cant believe they filmed some of this in Eltham
I think I am about to become a Huge fan of Timothy Chalamet
I dont care what actor it is this looks like dump and we shouldnt allow hollywood to be so uncreative in all these new movies
Director of Paddington Im in
""
Candy is dandy but liquor is quicker
Am I the only one who cant see Timothee as Willy wonka
El nico Wonka que vale es el de Jhonny Deep 
Charlie and the chocolate factory is the perfect adaptations so an remake would not work
This looks cute I want to watch this
I love chocolate
Who wanted this
As soon as I heard those notes I was sold Finally WB get it it would seem
The production and supporting cast is amazing The story is funny and a whimsical interpretation of actual drug lords or big Monopoly corporations Idk how I feel about the main character but hopefully is a pleasant surprise he does well
Wow this look awful
"Looks horrible
Might turn out but it looks like it wont"
Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka seems like if the High School football Captain tried to play the wizard in a a school play
"The film actually seems quite good though I do think the idea is a little unnecessary
But what the heck Ill definitely watch it
If its good Id like them to do two sequels"
this is truly the moment when willy became wonka
Everyone calling this woke has a combined IQ of 12
Another one
Cant wait til Youtubers make Wonka but every time someone says chocolate X happens videos
Mr Bean as the elevator operator Nice to see him again
Awww this actually looks really cute
I have a positive reaction to this
Odd casting choice for wonka
Theyre making a what is it prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate factory The story ended how to keep it going Im guessing a completely new write Wont be the same without Jonny Depp but seems worth a watch Trailer looks like its well done
So is this a prequel of the first willy wonka movie
Im all in for this
Wonka e la ragazza di cioccolato
Cant wait for the third installment where he builds the Snowpiercer
This is stupid
Wheres the part where he builds the Snowpiercer
If didnt get an unwanted origin and an amount of The Glass Elevator with Tim Burtons film Id be more open to to this film
not bad
Did I just see hugh grant from notting hill dance in a glace jar as an oompa loompa
Wtf
Woke trash although the production value looks good
the movie is very moving its distracting but its very nice
Weve all watched the original at one point its a classic
         
I just have a feeling they will incorporate the LGBTQ community in this movie somehow
Hard pass Nothing tops the original
Rowan Atkinsons Run away is already too ICONICC
Hopefully they stay true to the cannibalism
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
Uh oh
Woke bs lol
cringe
BIG UP LYME REGIS JS DOWN THE ROAD FROM ME  Watched them film this
Gene Wilder The one and only Willy Wonka  RIP
its WONKAs  timeeee
I LIKE this
I just hope its good These remakes have been rough to sit through at the movie theaters
Once weve started  we cant stop 
Mr bean D
"This is very interesting 
Its interesting to see how the movie is going to turn out once you take a peek at isnt it"
Ill fight whoever thought it was a good idea to not cast Robert Sheehan as Willy wonka
this looks awful lol
I was expecting to see Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka but oh well Im sure it will be great
Put on a forward roll
Amazing casting
Hugh Grant Wheres Warwick Davis when you need him
Ehhh looks too goofypass
""
Gene Wilder was the best
All I see is another terrible film
I have serious goosebumps after watching this Im so ready 
Its simple this does not look good
Why didnt they hire a little person to be the Umpa Loompa
       
So is he a young Gene or young Johnny
I cried when he yelled Adrian  at the end
Well this does look interesting But i still wish the moviemakers woukd stop making remakes sometime soon please  but this looks good
Interesting take on the IP i like it
It shouldve been Jeremy Allen white 
i am getting the wonka cut tomorrow yippee
Last year my school did a Willy Wonka musical and it was honestly one of the best plays Ive seen by my school especially since I was backstage in stage crew doing all the props and that stuff I have a feeling that this movie is going to be a good one and I love that its going to come out on my birthday Definitely gonna watch this as a gift to myself
I love Hugh but damn was that cg beyond distracting
Rowan atkinson 
Looks more like a Harry Potter rip off
Pre prequel must be already in the work Ill be in the front row with chocolates in hand
Jonka
Naw
This doesnt look totally wretched so thats already a bit above what I was expecting
Looks stale Because the original is such a good film I will watch it dont seem like I would watch it twice tho
Is it me or does the lady in the crowd looks like Loreen
were really scraping the barrel now how much do you bet that boggis bunce and bean will each get their own films
"Nosorry but I feel so awkward when watching this trailer The Willy Wonka Jonny Depp played was too classic and I  just cant help and kept comparing them when watching this trailer I dont find this Willy Wonka charming or mysterious  he looks like a 17 who thinks they know everything 
The Oompa Loompas looks great though He might be the only reason I want to watch this movie"
"Lets hope this time a hot curvy juicy and malevolous classy woman turns into a blimpy super inflatable blueberry
 The producers of Harry Potter Ok hopefully the props to inflate aunt Marge now can be used for this other hypotetical lady D
 Chocolate that makes people float I like to think before it has perfected the helium in that chocolate also inflated the test subjects like balloons

  Ok Im obsessed with inflating people but I know Im not the only one 
 Im glad they are using oompa loompas closer to the look of the 1971 movie"
I cant believe how great this is going to be   My childhood all over again
This looks AWFUL
Ahh yes Victorian London was known for its high African population
Timothee simply does not have the whimsical silliness to play Willy Wonka He just isnt a silly little man nor is he a goofy guy
"This must be a prequel to Tim Burtons adaptation of the Chocolate Factory
"
This does not look the least bit interesting tbh
I absolutely hated the movie with Johnny Depp even tho hes my favorite actor but I didnt like anything else in that movie Hopefully this one is better
Johnny Depp we miss you 
Well this looks good but its not Johnny Depp playing itIm sorry but I might not watch it please dont hate me for that
Everything about this is wrong and I cannot wait for it to flop
reallyyyyy omg childhood goosebumps
Im out Looks horrible and inendable Its will feel like a 4 hr movie in the theater
did anyone want another Willy Wonka movie
Is he gonna kill off children in this one too
Guess Daniel Thrasher got tired of playing piano
I love that they got the narrator from the Johnny drop movies again
I hate remakes but this one way looks better than a Disney remake Cant wait to work for this company
I cant see anyone other than johny deppchildhood fav
I just think it looks bad 
i did not have chalamet as wonka on my bingo card this year
This is going to be great
Um again
Scratch that reverse it I thought it was strike that
"The previous Willy Wonkas were so good because as kooky and quirky as they were they had this darkness to them 
This guy looks so giddy "
We dont need this film But my god that cast will save it
can someone make something original like why do people pay to rewatch the same thing over and over
Whenther you prefer Depp or Wilders version I feel like Timothee is perfectly representing both equally Much appreciated 
This looks very bad
The kitkat haderach
not even gonna finsih the trailer cringe
Why
Looks so bad
Man they really have a checklist which childhood movies they gonna rape and destroy next
serious miscast tbh He cant have every role
warner we want live action of gantz
didnt realize danielthrasher was Willy wonka
"My two cents Gene Wilder left some awfully large shoes to fill and it wont be easy to do it  

So far I feel like Timothys body language and visual expression of Wonka is spot on but the voice acting leaves much to be desired  Take 010 for example where Wonka says scratch that reverse it robotically as if reading from a script  Contrast this with the original portrayal when he said strike that reverse it because he was overflowing with so much excitement that he was fumbling with his words

Maybe Im just being nostalgic for the original but on the other hand I think that every single other character in the trailer has completely nailed it"
""
Is the detail of his father being a dentist going to be shown
nope sorry looks like a remake that does not follow the original and no longer in the time frame or the vision  of the original
Seemed like a disaster because of the whole Tom and Jerry thing but this is their director of Paddington so I think this is going to be good
I dont like how this feels like a disney live action remake how willy became wonka is one of the dumbest taglines Ive ever heard
This is just stupid and it seems I live in a world full of morons
Im a HUGE fan of the Original Movie It hated Tim Burtons version this one looks really good
Looks like Johnsons last Beamer out of Saigon landed him in Wonka World
I git the idea  the have the production money  Looks great though  just what I thought of
Why is he wonka 
Are they gonna do the bubble gum scene Are they gonna do the scene where they eat the blueberry gum Are they gonna are they gonna do the scene that blows you up like a balloon if you chew the blueberry gum Are they gonna do th
Are all these comments bots Tims a good actor but every line in this trailer felt forced Maybe Im just old and cranky but Gene Wilder is the pinnacle for the character
Just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity Thats something to see buddy
When I see Timothee Chalamet I see myself back in the 70s wavy hair  thin
Who had Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa on their bingo card 
"Hugh Grant So what am I supposed to be doing
Casting Director You are a very small dancing man
Hugh Grant Say no more"
Id actually go see this I loved the original
imagine if theres a multiverse of willy wonkas  wonka makes a chocolate portal and out comes johnny depp
Just no
willy wonka is my special interest at the moment and i actually really excited to see this
Why are we making a third retelling of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Is Hollywood so bankrupt of original and creative content that pumping out remakes every 1020 years is all thats left
3 Willy Wonka iterations cus why not
     
I thought this movie had potential to be like a horror movie Very disappointing
Worst Title Ever
Looks awfulcomplete opposite of what made the original special
director and producer give me double huh
I KNOW THIS IS A PREQUEL BUT I NEED TO SEE A BLUEBERRY IN THIS MOVIE
Uh oh Im seeing clues that this is a full blown Musical They are trying hard to hide it in the trailer but I think this is a musical
This looks good
Ahhh a movie with Rowan Atkinson this will be great
Where did all the black people come from So if this was BEFORE   the original then how did they disappear in the 1971 film  another FLOP
im maken chocolate ah course
The chocolate cartel
timothy is so freaking awful in this role
The most good looking charming and sweet Wonka ever 
Wait Wasnt his dad a dentist
Squeals in delight OMG Yes A Willy Wonka Orgin story
THIS TRAILER IS SO GOOD the movies thats being recreated arent that bad but this will be so good
corny
looks fun and cute  sadly also looks OVERTLY intentional to to promote woke ideology   if we were not so inundated with such at this point in time  a movie that promotes out of the box thinking of social things has a place   a positive value  like all things though there is a point of diminishing returns though  which after diminishing is a point of negative return  When things are at a point of over  inundation this is  usually means realistically things are in a time of negative returns   This we certainly are in now   The woke idialogs are now killing the small gains  they made Some were not bad ones Recognizing there is a rare few gender dysphoric youth and adults who need help and promoting ways to get them that help was a good thing  taking it to the extreme of we must FORCE the world to cow tow to a tiny sliver of folk   wasis irrational
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa 
Hughmpa Loompa
This looks absolutely horrible
I came here expecting it to be another reboot that adds nothing but its actually kind of interesting A young businessman with novel inventions that will drastically change the industry is compelling
Should have had Ebon from The Bear
Not for me
This is how you know Hollywood is running out of ideas
Do we really need another wonka film Who cares about him that much
The backstory we all needed
How many times are we going to remake the same movie over and over Did our generation lose all creative and visionary talent
The Oompa flute tune from the Gene Wilder movie  214
Why
"Pay the feeeee and youll seeeeee a fiiiiiilm with no imagination
"
I think Freya is going to be the star of this film but then Im a bit biased
This looks good I gotta go see this
005 lol Im getting Jurassic world vibes with that soundtrack 
Hold on yo hes already perfected that which he was experimenting with way later in life Lazy
No No NO NO NO NO 
Looks like absolute shite Enough with these reboots
Soooo glad to see people arent just assuming its going to be terrible This looks amazing to me Cant wait I think Timothee will do Wonka proud
the actor line up for this movie looks great 
Nope
Why would you cast someone with no charisma as Willy Wonka
It looks ok from the trailer Timothy chalamets acting doesnt look great
Dumb
Oh wow another remakereboot Please stop doing this Please
Hes not charming enough for the role Nepotism at play again
This would be the best movie ever and I hope Timothy would sing Pure Imagination like gene wilder
Am I the only one who sees mr bean
""
Now theyve come for another fond childhood memory The bastards
I thought this came out like five years ago lol
"Hard Pass forced comedy meta throwbacks to original fighting against an establishment  updated version of a classic song that doesnt need changed dead faced Timothy origin story

Its too generic and overly produced and packaged like a marvel movie but with Wonka  Lets ruin another Roald Dahl story with a reimagining

Ill stick with Genes slightly mean spirited but lovable version


Make original stories instead of trying to profit off of nostalgia"
""
Nobody can capture what gene wilder put into that role all of you thinking that chalamet is doing right by him are wrong him saying scratch that reverse that just sounds so off to me and not even close to the same as gene
Charlie and the chocolate factory was one of my all time favourites growing up its nice to see them do an update on how his story started it looks amazing cant wait to see it
I hate hollywood so much
So is this movie bout how willy Wonka started 
This is your reminder that Jesus took the punishment that we all deserve so that we could be forgiven and he loves you so much that no matter how far you are away from God he will welcome you with love and open arms if you just believetrust repent and love Jesus and remember what he did for us
Im a big fan of Willy Wonka movies when I was a kid especially the Tim Burton Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  
YOU ARE RUINNING MY CHILDHOOD INSTEAD OF POOR WITE BOY YOU ARE DOING ANOTHER RANDOM BLACK GIRL
"Bridgerton 20

When they do a remake of Zulu are they going to cast 1000s of pastyfaced Scotsmen charging over the hill at the Welsh Guards"
Where is Johnny Depp
Cringe
yung willy wonka had braces and a helmet fucc is this
Another one good grief why cant they make something original 
So lush and full of whimsical epic greatness The visuals reminded me of Federico Fellinis films I hope the story is good
Back in the day we wouldve called this a tumblr sexyman Weve grown Unfortunately its now a tiktok sexyman
man this looks horrible
My grandma always told me that she didnt care what they tell you in school  Wonkas Chocolate Factory was founded by a black girl
He cannot match Jonny Depp
Of course he has to have a black female sidekick because its 2023 
042  Its all so tiresome
This cast is an odd choice but fun nonetheless
WACK
Wait Sally hawkins sheemy favvv
this is big time the casts
"Looks like another PC disaster
White boy morphs into black girl"
Nothing will surpass the original film with Gene Wilder Peter Olstrum and Jack Albertson Ill watch this one just like i did the one with Johnny Dep but its just a remake of a work of art
Omg is it mrBean
Charlie an the chocolate factory is my favorite movie so please dont mess this up Why dont they ever make new movies anymore just remakes
disappointed
Johnny depp has done phenomenal work this guy sucks 
But we need a special Cameo If you know what I mean WB
Looks like a perfectly anodyne experience Although Id say that one of the most interesting things about Willy Wonka in the first place was that no one knew much about him Part of the wonder surrounding his methods and seemingly infinite factory was that hed just always been there and never let anyone in I just wish we could see a new IP in this era of cinema It seems like every studio from Disney to Warner Brothers making popular movies just uses some classic character or franchise and just explains away their backstory while removing all mystery from the world and contributing to fatigue
Garbage prequel
Best thing about this movie  ROWAN ATKINSON
This is a masterclass of how NOT to do a trailer feels like I dont need to watch this now
Ill watch this
ROWAN ATKINSON 
Looks good but nothing beats the original
"I mean it looks great but it doesent have Johnny depp


Edit its not great and is still missing johnny depp"
I cant wait to see how horrible this movie is going to be
Had no much doubt for this film until this trailer it might be another rare case of a prequel being on par  or possibly even better than the previous film
All the loyal characters that help Willy build his chocolate empire will soon be fired without cause and locked out of his factory Except for the Oompa Loompas who according to the book are paid in cocoa beans
This hits different
Finally I waited since I was a kid 
"Wonka or Wokea 
Cant trust Hollywood these days"
Thats different
Yep Watching it
Timothy wasnt acting herehe was being himself
Whats with all the black people  There wasnt any black people in the old ccf 
This looks amazing Im glad its going to be a prequel to the original film from 1971 and seeing Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was something I didnt know I needed in my life
oof Timothy shouldve auditioned
This looks absolutely retarded
I hope this turns out well But Gene Wilder is too good as Willy Wonka
I have always envisioned my Willy Wonka prequel is being a mix between Pride and prejudice and Arthur Conan Doyles Lost World I like the idea of Wonka looking for obscure ingredients in South America and elsewhere and coming back with the oompa loompas which in the original version were meant to be African pygmies You could place their theoretical tribe in any geographical region and use some type of Agartha inspired explanation for why they havent been found like the deep caves in China and things like that but ultimately there was something mysterious and serious and Gene Wilders performance that people keep straying away from I would like him to be portrayed with a bit of the madness and zanying us but ultimately closer to a Nikola Tesla type figure whose reaches into various fields of study and invention might have been used for chocolate but ultimately theyre significance is greater I think his attitude in regard to authority is something similar to Goodwill Hunting when Will is interviewed by the government and he says he wouldnt want to be involved in bombing a building which happened to have a janitor in it with six kids waiting for him at home etc He wouldnt want to be an Oppenheimer or have his inventions used for warmongering or greedy pursuits Hes someone who understands the scientific practicality of having to make the magic like a theme park owner but whos pursuit of ideals is primarily philosophical in nature and the money is only to fund his dreams reality I appreciate what they were going for here but Im sincerely disappointed
No grandpa joe  off to a good start keep it that way
"The random Rat Race reference is a random Rat Race reference

RUN AWAY "
We are currently in the generation of remakes Reimaginings and sequels that should never have been made Why not add another one to the list
Make something new
This looks like a parody are they serious
for some reason i never considered this movie would be for kids and have the gall to be disappointed
What Willys not black  Must not be a Disney Film Warner Bros must not have fallen into that BS
Terrible casting
"If its woke 
WB will choke"
Sigh
My Interstellar boy Tom has becoming a super star 
I think i saw Mr Bean  again
is anyone else really excited about this bc of timothee
He looks so much like Daniel Thrasher in this when he does the facial expressions HAHAHA
Hes to flat boring normal to be Wonka
It looks fun
Everything seems way too normal for a Wonka movie
Theres was pretty much no dark chocolate  in Victorian england why is there such a hard attempt to convince the young otherwise I wonder 
The next movie is his fall from grace to become the crazy guy Gene Wilder plays
"Lots of diversity for a movie about chocolate
What is Wonkas vaccination policy Is it as strong as Hersheys
No jab no job Get vaccinated or boosted today as they say"
025 he did the Mathilda Airlines
Why do they always act like Charlie and the Glass Elevator isnt a thing I would much rather see that then this fan fiction
Is the actor who plays willy wonka sight reading its absurd
Always wanted a Wonka movie set in Africa
DANIEL THRASHEERRRRR
141 Mr Bean 
Anyone else just not find him believable as Wonka  Im a fan of the two willy wonka movies the original is my favorite I believe Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka but I dont really see Chalamet as wonka
Out of place dark chocolate shoehorned in as per usual and everyones sick of it
Looks very harry potter
Rowan Atkinson in a wonka moviemy life is complete
A little nonsense now and then is cherished by the wisest men
Muaddib is going through a wet phase I see No matter ShaiHulud shall pass this city and cleanse it

""
This protagonist looks like Harley from Mobile Legends Hahahaha
"I love when they use the producer from as its such a cop out Ive seen it used before to make you think wow its the same people that did Harry Potter

Actually no Not at all The producer couldve done literally next to nothing and your a fan thinking he helped really make the movies and the reality is no"
Ngl Im actually really looking forward to this
Hugh Grant seems fantastic but Timothee Chamalet is not quirky enough to be Willy Wonka
Dark white nutty
Woof
Black girl in early 20th century England At least 50 is black in terms of the police and the entire population looks roughly that amount as well Do you know the racial demography of the country during that time period is 99 white Just stop It doesnt fit the setting How embarrassing
i dont think chalamet is good enough for this role same way i feel about his paul atreides but whatever rip gene wilder the real wonka
movie looks nice tim ad wonka not really matter of fact he looks so out of place here it was so difficult to watch him acting all eccentric and energetic its just not him
Ebey
I hate how they remake this franchise every 10 years Who is so fascinated with this moviecharacter Dumb
Man Wonka is giving Daniel Thrasher vibes It makes me mourn what could have been 
Yeah you lost me at flying people
This looks terrible
Rowan Atkinsonnnn too
This is gonna be way better than the little mermaid
Yeahcant wait to see this one
This Christmas belongs to Timothee First Dune Part 2 now Wonka
"Ummm  I dont know about this movie 
Gene Wilders portrayal of Wonka is unmatched but each to their own opinion
New generation new Wonka "
Horrible
Now this feels like a Harry Potter movie haha
Great another silly over animated slap stick moviesooooo needed
Well if the goal is to bankrupt shareholders good job
Looks horrible Loreens music videos is much better
Politically correct garbage
This looks terrible
Im begging this wont be another cop out and will actually be a good movie for the sake of being a good movie I also love the policeman design they look sorta AustrianPrussian
Id honestly much rather see an adaptation of Great Glass Elevator or Charlie and the Grand Reunion which yes I know is a fan fiction but it is such a good fan fiction that I think it should get some more love
Timothees acting seems sort of stiff no
Excited for this Especially with the same producer as the Harry Potter movies Bring back the magic 
AKHIRNYA DELFI BANDUNG RILIS FILM TERBARU 
WILLY WONKA IS BACK
This guy is in 2 huge movies wtf
Had no idea what the movie was called but had a hunch of I searched Wonka Id find my self here
Rowan Atkinson Im 100 watching this
Lame   No thanks
Tf they got lil Mabu doing in this
"I gotta admitI dunno if Im weird or just in a weird mood but this trailer made me laugh multiple times so Im interested 
    I mean come on chocolate cartel Hugh grant as an oompa loompa 
        I gotta ask though are they gonna reference the tunnel scene"
Ohho  great
Mr Wokeerh Mr Wonka
As someone who grew up watching the Gene Wilder version religiously this put the biggest grin on my face
nothing to see here just a small group of people defying gravity 
This may be the first movie in history to make 0 in the box office
Personally wouldve preferred midgets as the oompa loompas
This actually looks good
New Timothee chalamet as willy timothee chalamet as willy Wonka wonka 2023
Wouldve been nice if Jeremy Allen white got the part of Willy wonka
YESYESYESYESYESSS
HE ISNT SUPPOSE TO EAT THE CHOCOLATES why is he constantly chomping on it
Hahaha Hugh Grant is so funny the most funny thing I have seen today Movie will be 1st rate one I am waiting for Christmas
Uuuugh No new ideas Just a rehash of the same old story  and not a very good one at that Why dont you just remake Captain Ron or Drop Dead Fred or perhaps a 17th Rocky movie Pathetic
I first thought that it was Hugh Laurie not Hugh Grant as the OompaLoompa
No Im sorry  They needed a better lead role he just doesnt seem to fit the part
Is it Willy Wonka from the movie Charlies Chocolate Factory
Ill wait for the reviews
Hugh Grand as the Oompa wtf why
"I SAW AT LEAST 4 MAJOR BBBLK CHARACTERS IN THIS TRAILERYET NOT A SINGLE ASN AMERICAN LTINO AMERICAN ARAB AMERICAN INDIAN AMERICAN ETC ETCITS 2023THEY NEED TO SET A QOUTA SYSTEM TO INCLUDE ALL AMERICANSTHIS AINT NO BBBLK WHTE COUNTRY AND BBBLKS HAVENT BEEN THE MAJORITY MINORITY SINCE 2000ENOUGH OF THIS GARBAGE

Okay honestly the oompa loompa got me loll
Any horrible histories fans here 
Ollie Wonka
How you like your chocolate dark whiteNuTty 
Hollywood has no shame whoring out a great idea until noone cares anymore Like Marvel
I saw Mr Bean
Michael Scott will always be my Willy Wonka
Something tells me this will be Willy Woka
COOL 
""
141 Rowan Atkinson Evetybodyyyyy
Si no es JOHNNY DEPP no es lo mismo
Sorry the way he talks isnt wonka AT ALL
Oompa Loompas were like so funny in the end
Nothing will ever beat the original but Ill be honest for a prequel in 2023 this couldve been alot worse
Trash Absolute trash This is the most I will ever interact with this movie
Timothy Chalamet embodies the childness of the character but hes too young to be Wonka Im the book WW travelled and had a ton of stories about his life Im the first movie WW spoke about retirement I think he may be cute but not right for this role
Again Another fkn remake Just leave this movie alone already
they were filming this near my old house a few months ago
130 Whats up with the unrealistic physics simulation
who up wonkin they willy rn
No need to hate this new wonka My generations wonka was Depp and i liked it a lot when i was a kid and for this new wonka its for the new generation just like me when i was a kid For the wonka 1971 wilder fans and for the wonka 2005 depp fans no need to hate this because we are not the main target audience here
Hughmpa loompa doompity hugh
I dont know how I know it but I KNOW that this movies gonna be AWESOME
oh god
The suspense is terrible I hope it will last
Why does he sound like number 5 from Umbrella Academy
Looks like a LOT of dark brown colors and not just the chocolate in this sure to be woke movie
Chali and the chocalate factory i love it
Im not watching this
This looks so stupid I dont know why they feel the need to keep remaking masterpieces and putting a different spin on it They dont even realize what made wonka a great movie It wasnt about the chocolate  it had sooo many deeper meanings throughout the movie Even darker tones Its meant to be shrouded in mystery Wonka was a complex character and no one has even gotten close to understanding what made him work Honestly i would prefer a older charlie story now ready to pass on the factory to another
Name of the movie sounds like Napoleon
This looks really good  I was very skeptical when I first heard about a prequel
I love Charlies and the chocolate Factory since I could remember as a kid Even til this day I have it on VHS
Am I the only one who thinks that TC lacks the charisma to play Wonka He seems pretty dull in this
The second hand embarrassment I feel watching this is immense
Sally Hawkins absolutely kills in everything shes in I cant wait for this
I like the whimsical feel to the film from the snippet weve seen I hope it can strike that balance so it doesnt seem too corny Thats really my only concern otherwise i think Chalamete will perfectly capture Wonkas kooky nature which will be the heart of the film Im excited
Willy wonka willy wonka and his amazing chocolate factory
Since this is a prequel that means Grandpa Joe is bed ridden
love me a magical christmas movie
wish Gene was alive to see this
Ive watched this trailer about 20 times I am so excited for this
Would it have killed the lead to try and sound like Gene Wilder It doesnt sound like Wonka at all This will be a pass for me
I get the feeling this is going to be a lot of eye candy with little substancelike chocolate
Since when did Wonka become Harry Potter
Complete with the token black kid What a dumpster fire
"There is only one real movie of
Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka"
cool this looks terrible
I better see him do that one thirst trap dance
Omg this actually looks so good
Great movie
Perfect Xmas film I reckon our whole family will watch all year around for comfort  There arent enough new films which are just fun magical and sincere in its whimsicality
LETSS GOOOO
Rest in peace to Gene Wilder  The one  only Willy Wonka
Not bad different  but still like the johnny depp version
looks forced
Im not sold of this concept but  the actors and directors are solid so maybe they can sell it
No just no
this looks amazing
This is the story of Willy Wonkas beginningsand OMG its going to be good if Sally Hawkins plays his mum   I adore Sally 
MR MOSEBY IS MAKING A COMEBACK
Typically movie trailers showcase all the best bits without spoiling the movie to generate as much interest in the movie as possible I really respect the fact that this trailer does the opposite
Timothee as Willy is going to be amazing
""
This kid looks 15 he is not Willy Wonka
this looks so terrible
Thimothee Chalamet is the perfect prequel Wonka to Johnny Depps Wonka  I CANNOT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE
I dont really like the Barbie movie so I prob wont like this one
Should have gone with how Willy got his Wonka on
When I saw it in my feed I was like No noooo look how the massacred my boy But  after actually watching the trailer and seeing the directors and producers I can say that I am pleasantly surprised and actually looking forward to a new movie for the first time in years
without johnny depp it just wont hit the same
This looks awful Why do they keep on remaking movies Has Hollywood lost all ideas Comic books and remakes is all they come out with Hard pass
First of all the racism in the comment section is showing how is it 2023 people are still mad about a person of color  also everyone forgets that this is Willy wonka before Willy wonka yall just want a reason to hate and be miserable
"Aaahhh charlie and the chocolate factory 
my childhood memory
i lovedddd that movie i used to wish that one day God give me chance to visit this factory watched it many times when i was a kid will surely watch this no matter if i am not a kid now "
Willy Wonka X Harry Potter would be a game changer and explain alot

Not a fan of the overuse of CG or weird repetitive overcast lighting Looks like a Disney live action remake
Wow
Oml it said from the director of paddington and Willys mom is the mom from paddigton
Im hyped for the movie but why did they added this girl in the movie to be willy wonkas friend makes no sense Charlie should be in this movie not some random black girl 
Im happy its a prequel and not a remake It looks cute Ill check it out
"Wow The roles Timothee is getting He is on his way to become the next Johny depp 
Hope he doesnt meet the next amber heard"
ROALD DAHL YOUVE DONE IT AGAIN
Charlie and the chocolate factory  Mr Bean  Perfect combo to relive my childhood memories 
Roald Dahl is turning in his grave
Kinda bummed it looks like its not following the original book lore that was shown in the Depp version
I only watch this because of Rowan Atkinson
Bet there wont be no song about getting fat by eating to much chocolate because of all the fatties these days
Looks great looking forward to it
""
So unfortunate that someone thinks that the 2nd version wasnt enough of a trainwreck and has decided to defile the magic of this story yet again with this mishmash of dry acting and disgraceful plot
And willy wonka that i know is jhonny deep 
Usually not a fan of this kind of stuff but for an origin story this looks pretty interesting with a great cast along with the charm of the first wonka movie I loved while growing up 
Blackwashing Again
This was never done before Great freakin idea 
No nohh nooo
Winks is so good hes made a girl out of chocolate
What a dumb idea
Literally nobody wanted this movie
MrBeast THE MOVIE
Timothys Wonka seems very normal Not the vibe of Depps performance
As a chocolate lover I see this as an absolute W
What an utter and complete waste of time money and resources Please tell me that this is a parody Little black girl please Mista Wonka help us allLOL
My auntie went to the same school as Charlie 2009 FILM and after the film was realised he was famous in the school
Honestly this movie and this trailer alone feels so bright adventurous and magical and i cant wait to watch it in theaters in Christmas
What happened to Johnny depp
Rown Atiknson Scene
so cute
TIMOTHEE IS SO PERFECT INCREDIBLE WONDERFUL AMAZING AND ABSOLUTELY GORGEOUS HE LOOKS INCREDIBLE AND GORGEOUS IN WILLY WONKAS ROLE TIMMY IS MY HUSBAND  I LOVE TIMOTHEE SMMMM 
bruh so many good actors to cast as willy and you decided to choose this one
Hes so cute 
Modern Hollywood the historical European thing you like now with quotafilling black people So cringe
Yaaaaaaay awesome
This looks pretty good and Im here to see it out
This is gonna make Mission Impossible bank Whoohooo
Willy Woka 
kinda sceptic at first but im excited to see Timmy do something different
Feel in this trailer is more magic in this trailer than in fantastic beasts movies
Bad
Disney lazyness is astonishing
Looks good I got goosies
Only one Wonka and thats Gene Wilder
Im looking forward to watching a movie release after a very long time
So shines a good deed in a weary world  Willy Wonka 1971 Theyre bringing the spirit of the first film back and Im totally on board
Too complex 
As a HUGE FAN of Willy Wonka From Gene Wilder to Johnny Depp this trailer LOOKS FANTASTIC A MASSIVE W
NOT HUGH GRANT BEING AN OOMPA LOOMPA IS THE MOST FUNNIEST THING IVE SEEN
Ya no one wants this garbage
Paul Atreides hasnt been the same since his family was killed
Too many black folks for this time period
I am 100 sure that the vast majority of comments here are paid fakes Unless all normal human beings started talking exactly like ad agency writers
010
Wow this looks terrible lol
When i first saw that they were making a new willy wonka movie some years ago i tought to myself yay another same movie just diffrent castings But damn its a whole prequal and backstory och willy wonka and im all for it
finally timmy wont be playing himself
Bots are the top comments hmmmm
We didnt ask for another Wonka We didnt need another Wonka And we dont want another Wonka Get some new and ORIGINAL ideas WB STOP ACTING LIKE DISNEY YOURE BETTER THAN THIS
Nah
All that just to end up turning a girl into a blueberry drowning a kid in chocolate and watching a young girl get attacked by squirrels The first two are my favorite movies still
yo wonka
I hate this Hate hate hate hate HATE this It feels so aggressively unrelentingly fake As if all the money in the world can cover up inauthentic hollow performances God this looks plastic and dead I wouldnt spend money on this to save my own life
Another wokeness trash remakereimagined
Yesssss Im so excited Holiday season 2023
Missing depp 
Definitely GARBAGE
Aaaaaaa I cannot wait
Hopefully WB and Nestle promotes the Movie with Wonka Bars with a Golden Ticket  and the winner of the Golden Ticket is a free movie  ticket to watch Wonka
I love Chalamet as much as the next guy but I cant help but feel like he binged Jim Carrey for 3 weeks straight before filming
This seems like a horrible miscast with Timothee Chalamet feels so forced Pass
Seriously wtf Hollywood did you read the book
I wish Depp made a cameo
"set to 025x

go to 034

pause every frame"
Ok I gotta admit here Im interested lol Origin story of Willy Wonka This is prob the first movie I didnt want but glad its coming Hope its good with the cast they have
Make something new
He doesnt seem like the the right type of crazy for the role
Who wonking their willy rn
God this is terrible Creativity in Hollywood is dead As an aspiring filmmaker Im grateful to be aware of that fact because that means I can avoid selling my soul to this industry and stick to indie productions Thanks for showing me why not to take jobs from big studios Hollywood 
Something is missing here but idk what
Oh look garbage
Looks bad
who up wonking they willy rn
""
Peterson Joseph is going to steal the show Stick that up your Dojo
please dont butch this
Gahhh another Willy wonka movie Gah why must they ruin such a perfROWAN ATKINSONS Op imma see it
When I heard about it didnt really care one way or the other but damn did this trailer show me that I wanna watch this but they put out the trailer way too soon because that tells me theyre gonna be giving away way too much information on it
I wish theyd made a movie of the actual sequel by Roald Dahl Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator instead of this prequel
NO WAYY MY DREAM IS BECOMING TRUE YAYAYAYAYA
Underwhelming to say the least
This is going to be reeeeaaally bad
BRING BACK JOHNNY 
looks woke af
Why they took it so long to do this Thank you for coming
The thing I liked the most is that they did a great work assigning Timothee as Willy Wonka  Perfect match
YOOO ROWAN ATKINSONS IN THE FILM
"Tim is just illegally great in everything hes in

On the other hand any writer that unironically uses the line I got an idea deserved to be fired Out of the railgun Into the Betelgeuse"
Aside from the bit with Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa the trailer didnt really do much for me
I really like wonka
He sounds like Jessie Eisenberg lol
This looks horrible
 please stop raping my childhood and ruining everything that used to be good in the world
This looks horrible
Who thinks that Chalamet is funny
""
XCUSE ME WAS THAT MR BEAN SCREAMING RUN AWAY 141 
Oh no  Please dont tell me that in this terrible time of virtue signaling that someone has turned Willie Wonka into a kind and loving person Spreading good cheer Changing the world Have they read the book Seen the original masterpiece Wilder  Wonka is a self obsessed psychopath And a darn good one He has no feelings for anyone This time of changing great stories into woke garbage to lift up a group gender or race in spite of the story will not be remembered well
Why does chalamets performance seem off in the trailer Like he is trying too hard to be full of whimsy Also gene wilder did this role perfectly never understood remaking it
no one can replace Johnny depp willy wonka
looks terrible 2 good 3rd is terrible wjeres the choclate factory
Another desperate unoriginal cash grab from Hollywood that I cant wait to not go see
Why
I dislike reboots with trendy actors and refurshied stories
"Girl why is it so small 
Me 208"
Now this is a cast 
Johnson Alan Johnson
I dont see any madness in his eyes
This looks sooo good and not just because it making me want to eat chocolate  
Stop trying to remake a masterpiece
I cannot wait  The original was my favourite childhood movie with the og oompaloompa song and the remake was fascinating but different Now a prequel HEAVEN
His friend is a little girl weird
The best part of the trailer us Hugh Grant and hes barely in it
Honestly I dont see anything in this trailer to motivate me into spending my time and money on seeing this movie I guess some parents will take kids but really dont see this as becoming a big hit 
Timothe is a great actor loved him in the King movie cant remember the name
Why isnt Wonka black though
Bad casting the guy playing wonka is too cringe the movie looks fun but he is not pulling it off
Hope when this has first visited  Cinemas etc that it gets released on dvdblu ray for collectors This produces more revenue and more jobs and keeps collectors happy  Some film companies need to wake up and stop just thinking streaming
""
I never thought wed be getting a prequel but here we are It looks amazing Im defently gonna watch this when it comes out
That will remove the bad taste in the mouth left by Tim Burtons chocolate
Im glad this is a prequel and not a sequel Interesting to know how he created that multi billion dollar business
But will we see grandpa Joe
Not sure I like the lead here but it doesnt look too bad  At least its not a Disney movie
Id watch  looks entertaining
rip off of one piece
"  20
     "
What about the Oompa loompas
Daniel Thrasher is that you
Hindenburg
         
I uhI dont know what to make of this
No kids so
I JUST CANT IT LOOKS LIKE HARRY POTTER
So i guess he didnt want to be a duke and went to the chocolate business
bruh
"Ehhh

Has the every third actor casting problem

Somehow the world of Gene Wilders Willy Wonka became less diverse with time

Stop it Hollywood  Just stop it  No one cares"
Mr Bean in the elevator lol
How long will it take Americans to realise they should probably stop forcing their actors into the stories of other places
Chalamet is an incredible actor but he just doesnt have the charisma for this
who asked for this
Kind a missing Johnny Depp But love it 
Oh look another movie where CGI takes roles away from little people
This kid just is not Willy Wonka Wilder did it perfectly Depp made it unique and at least succeeded in the wacky aspect But this This just feels like bang average hollywood leading man dressed up as Wonka
Feels useless without JD
Its the kids version of Chocolat
This is really good movie
Part of this is  in Germany
Well I wasnt sure about this one then Hugh the oompa loompa 
oh no willy wokea
Marvelous    Simply marvelous
NOOOO
Pogi nmang Wonka Nayan 
WILLY WONKA
Okay This should be fun
Mom can we get Harry Potter No we have Harry Potter at home  This movie is the Harry Potter they have at home
My Timmy  hes so good in everything
Cares
So what is missing imagination
bruh
Cant wait 
107 anyone else see Mr Moseby from Zak  Cody or 
That run away thingy i so iconic mr beann
nice
this looks great
I finished watching season two of The Bear Jeremy Allen White could be a perfect Willy Wonka dude looks like a young Gene Wilder
"Woke wonka and the cgi oompa loompa
They shouldve convinced peter dinklage to accept the role instead of grant"
Cant come up with an original idea huh
What an original story idea Never heard of it before I love original ideas
103 Ariana mr bean what are you doing here
Overrated actor This will expose his one dimensional acting
 
May be he can bring good quality chocolate to America 
MrBean 
Damn this literally looks like the most unnecessary and annoying thing ever
Ok Im sold This was not on my radar at all but will be a Xmas holiday must
Ahhhhhhh Willy wonky has been my childhood for so long and when I saw this I never wanted to see a movie so bad Ugh Im so excited for it to come out3
this is like Oz the story of the wizard not dorothy
did wonka not kidnapped the ompa loompa in the forest and forced them to work for him lol
I wanted johnny depp to play this
Timothee chalamet  is imagine if they had cameo of jhonny depp
Nop
So is Willy Wonka a metaphor for chocolate in West Africa say in Ivory Coast and Ghana Because then it would make sense if The Chocolate Cartel is Cadbury The Hershey Company and Nestl 
Snowpiercer prequel Okay
After Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory majestically acted by Jhonny Depp any attempt to make something better is just a waste of time Give us something original
"We have Johnny Depp at home

Johnny Depp at home"
Looks good
garbage hott fuking garbage
Ah yes the obligatory black character where none originally existed
Generic whimsical nothing trailer for a prequel no one asked for
Omg why
141 cant wait to see mr bean getting chased by the giraffe 
Why is it that in 2005 we can make Bill Nighy look like a practical effect Davy Jones and yet Hugh Grant looks like you made it for a school project 18 years later
This better tie into snowpiercer  somehow
I havent seen many of chalamets movies and im not saying hes a bad actor but i always see him as an actor only in serious rolestones Might take me some time and few watch to maybe open up to him as wonka
The lead actor doesnt have the charisma to pull of this role and he and the little girl who isnt particularly convincing have no apparent chemistry together Awesome sets and scenery but it has the look of a soulless prequel
Looks so fun definitely gna take the fam
"hmmm I really dont know What shall I say



here we are going again

mony mony mony mony mony mony mony mony 
                                                         edit in my must watch list"
Johnny depp live as this character
I am cautiously optimistic this could be good
Hes looking like a Carl from Mr Beast
Just feels to me like Timothee is really having to act and it is ending up too forced therefore not working for me Wilder and Depp whether you liked their versions or not liked Wilders didnt like Depps did seem natural and almost effortless Also the accent doesnt fit for me at all either Rest of the elements all look good
This Wonka comes off like a pedophile doesnt have natural charm like the others I dont like him
"Nobody
Film industry Sorry no new ideas But what about endless prequels sequels remakes and whatever else that nobody did ask for No Not what you like Here you go anyways Go watch it we put Timothy Chalamet in it come on give us your money

Nothing against the actors though Timothy Chalamet is very talented for sure everybody loves Rowan Atkinson all fine but why not give them their own new roles"
Johnny Depp special guest
Not even close to the real man 
Wonka es Johnny Depp Dejen de inventar remakes de remakes
No plz
Will never watch this movie I dont care it will never be as good as our Johnny Depp
I absolutely love how this has the spirit of the 1971 original classic I even love the whistle tune that the Oompa Loompa does lol This film looks like its going to be magical Cant wait to see it
Rowan Atkinson is here too Now Im definitely cancelling my christmas gathering so I could watch this on repeat
Ah its paddington crossed with the original Gene Wilder movie You got me
Yay CC
Looks like another flop film lmao
This is no good They should have cast an English actor
Pretty sure all these positive comments are AI generated This movie looks awful
Ooof Casting howler
"I was one of those people who was adamantly against this because Roald Dahl the man who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory The Witches Matilda  James and the Giant Peach just to name a few didnt want anymore film adaptations of his work because he was displeased with the adaptations he got to see especially Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory  The Witches 

Growing up I didnt know those films were based off his books or that Dahl hated the way they put so much emphasis on Willy Wonka when it was suppose to be Charlies story or that in The Wicthes he hated the happy ending where the Witch turned good 

To me the film starring Gene Wilder is one of truly untouchable cinema  something I cherish dearly as I do The Witches Matilda  James  the Giant Peach Without these films being such treasured memories of my childhood I would never know who Roald Dahl was I appreciate that Hollywood sortakinda respected his wishes by not making anymore film adaptations of his work in his lifetime but it does bother me a bit that they keep making these films that dont have the same endings that he wrote

All that said I was extremely skeptical about  even wanted to hate this film before I even gave it a chance until I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Now I HAVE to go see the film Hopefully they start selling the Wonka Bars again Those were my favorite chocolate bars besides the Whatchamacallit  the Snickers"
TIMOTHEEEE CHALAMEEEETTTTTTTT AHHHHHHHHHHH
NOT MATT BAYNTON HORRIBLE HISTORIES IlovehimandHorribleHistories
Never see this coming
Who asked for this
Oh God 
Why Just Why BOMB
This looks really good
Where is Jhonny depp
Why are there no chinese or asian people in this film This is racial discrimination
sheeeeeeeeeeeetttt timothee chalamet pa nga
This is part of the Harry Potter universe
Timothy  is a nice guy and a versatile actor but his acting is not convincing to me There is something feeble in his acting
"If I do watch this film Im only doing it for 2 reasons  I want to see Rowan Atkinson play a bumbling priest again not seen him in such a role since 2 Weddings and a Funeral and secondly Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is absolutely hilarious 
The rest of the cast including Chalemet is a meh from me currently"
No no no Woke CGI fest Rubbish Gene is the only Wonka
Man Timothys performance looks soo weak One of the greatest Roald Dahl stories of all time man I h8 Hollywood looking for a quick  payday Sigh
Mr Bean is in this movie
Why is bro look like mabu
ive been dying for a prequel to willy wonka since i first watched the movie this was so NEEDED and the choice of actor was on point
RUN AWAY  my favorite part of this trailer  im happy to see MrRowan atkinson
Huge Depp fan here and I was a little iffy about this one when I heard about it because a JD role is gigantic shoes to fill but after seeing the trailer I think TC might just pull it off Willy Wonka is one of my favorite childhood movies so I really hope it lives up to the hype of the trailer I cant wait
Is that Johnson
Why didnt they cast Tom holland as Willy while they are on it
Johnson IFYKYK
     
Wooohooo woke wonka  Cant wait to miss it
""
Shout out st albans where this was shot some of it
"Oh great an annoying youngster willy wonka Theres never going to be another Willy Wonka Willy Wonka was Gene Wilder No ones going to compare to his willy wonka so dont even bother 

Also whats with all the darkness and brown Did they forget that one of the major things that made the original so good was how nice and colorful it looked The people who made this are absolute buffoons and should be embarrassed"
Hmm idk I really dont see TC as Wonka There was something special about the original movie and in the second one Depp was astounding Depp had the right mix of intelligence and strangeness Some mystery about him and at times he could still be creepy and innocent As for Oompa Loompa the short Indian man who played that role did fantastic too I used to actually find him scary and odd This trailer just doesnt quite hit it but hopefully the movie is better
You know we have come to a place where there is a lack of new and exciting movie content when producers start making prequels  IMHO nothing beats the original
"Who dont watch a movie that Rowan Atkinson is in AKA MR BEAN
"
This man couldnt act decently if his life depended on it
Music by Neil Hannon of the Divine Comedy yes
Wonka ISNT a psychopath Wtf was Gene Wilder doing that whole time
Whats a monumentally stupid looking film
Aaaaaaaaa GOOSEBUMPS
the forced diversity destroys every movie honestly
How can the prequel be this diverse So annoying not staying true to what followedI wont be able to watch it
Chocolate cartel Have some respect for your audience
Shish
Mr Bean is the priest in this film cant wait for this classic
can we have Panic At the Disco on the soundtrack please 
Naaaa he not comedic enough to be as witty
Well they sure checked the diversity box didnt they This looks thoroughly MEH
"Cant wait to see this
218 Too late I started dancing now "
Im a simple man Ive seen MrBean Im gonna watch the movie
Looks good tbh but WHY IS HE AMERICAN
so bad careless
Mr Wonka should definitely have used the Voice over the Chocolate cartel
Apart from Rowan being in this the trailer didnt do anything for me he didnt sell me as being Wonka and idk why they would do a prequel to the original movie and 1970s Oompa Loompas and not the 2005 version
I dont think chalamet is right for this role
Noo they ruined the style of the first to willy wonkas
""
Congrats Daniel Trasher for the main role 
Timothe Chalamet is soo FINE
You think Roald Dahl would have accepted made up prequels and sequels of his famous storys
looks extremely stupidly woke
Two things Hollywood blatantly sticking the odd black actor in a supporting role here and there just looks like wokeness box ticking Unfortunately theae actors do not represent the rest of globes ethnicities such as Latinos Asians Arabs Secondly you simply cant follow Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp  and if you try then you gotta get it right From these clips it doesnt look like a good representation of the Wonka character
it feels like if Johnny Depp or Jim Carrey where 3 decades younger either of them would be the perfect cast to play Willy Wonka
This is the over exposure of Timothy Chalamet  Frankly I am tired of seeing him in films and film series backtoback
once we dance we cant stop 
Mr bean 
They had me at chocolate
You had my curiosity But now you have my attention
Chalamets most renound roles were very moody and somber performances Hes just not right for this part and having him play against type isnt looking like its going to pay off for this movie
  
This is the movie to be excited for not effin Barbie
Thats like 3 days before my birthday
Are the oompa loompas going to twerk in this movie also
This feels more like genes wonka and I love that
Theres mr freaking Bean 
Where is Willy Wonka i know who is actually a dark and snarky sociopath in a borderline creepy murderous movie disguised as a tale for kids Who is this wonky happy child and what is this syrupy disney movie
Ahh just before Christmas Wonderful 
Looks horrible They need to stop rebooting and remaking come up with something original Theres no creativeness or imagination anymore
"Are we going to see Jhonny Depp as the older Willy
I would just love to even its for a small moment"
Why is Hugh Grant giving major Lord Farquaad energy
He is handsome
yikes
""
Im sorry but I have no clue why they cast Timothee Chalamet for this role
No This will flop Sorry
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
Warner Bros may want to check out a library sometime and find a story worth adapting then making another origin story no one asked for
gene wilder was MrWonka Everybody thought johnny depp couldnt pull it off he became Willy Wonka  I dont know how i feel about timothy havent seen the movie i just dont feel willy or mrwonka from him
OMG This is a must see
i DONT WANT TO SEE LIZARD BOY AGAIN HES BAD HES NO GOOD
Well that does not look very good and the guy isnt throwing off Wonka vibes at all very generic acting it seems
Why did we need this third reboot
Ouuuu yesss 
Willy Wonka  a mean slave driver who murder kids openly infront of their parents
I love Chalamet But I gotta say this feels like a mismatch
Timothy Chalamet was not the right actor for this he just sounds like himself and not the willy wonka character
Thank god disney would have ruined this project
""
Pass
This looks good whimsical and it doesnt have the racism of the original novel which is a major plus
please stop casting TC in movies this kid is Vanilla AF
you guys need to remember that with depp it was a darker adaptation of the original stop comparing it bc they are different adaptations
"the trailer looks really promising looking forward to it

BUT DECEMBER IS STILL SO FAR AWAY "
Wonder what that movie would have been like without political correctness
Cant wait to watch bruh 
Not saying that Timothee is a bad actor But to compare his portrayal of Willy Wonka to that of Depps makes me realise how uniquely talented Johny Depp was
Not the same without johnny depp
The Film Industry is dead
144 The balloons reminded me of Up2009 
Willy Wokea and the Factory of Color
We need Johnny Depp
wow this is really refreshing seeing the other side of Timothee Chalamet in the prequel of Depps Wonka cant wait
i was hoping i could see depp as cameo on this movie
Gonna be good
Im sorry timmy is overrated
I love it 
I was very discussed of all the recent years of stupid movies and to me doubting eyes came this movie trailer That looks very good  to be fair very very good I will defo go to see it to theatre
How many times is Hollywood going to beat a dead horse
""
150 Is that Loreen
Anybody else expecting Hugh Grant to be oompa loompas
Although Johnny Depp is my most favourite Willy Wonka and hell have this title forever ill watch this movie surely it seems really good and funny
confio en timmy
This looks fcking sick
Uhmm Why is this not horror  Willy Wonka is not this nice
mr bean  anyway i was like oh god not choclate factory the 2 before were amazing dont need a third one but thank god this is about the beginning
Going to watch this only for ROWAN ATKINSON 
cant wait to see this movie
The Michael Gary Scott biopicprequel he always wanted
Im sorry but hes not delulu enough
This seems really magical but idkwonka doesnt seem to have that fantastical whimsical magical absolutely insanely crazy vibe to him He should be the previous wonkas turned up 100000 thousand as this seems to be Wonkas backstory and startinh so his passion should be amplified by his youth but Im not an expert so this is just my opinion
Cautiously optimistic for this one But Ive been burnt by so many rebootsremakesprequelssequels Please be good
Looks boring
Looks horrible
I guess only rubbish can be made these days
I cant believe it thats like the first Willy Wonka prequel film to the original Willy Wonka film and pretty much its awesome they really made a movie based off on the origin story how Willy Wonka made chocolate and candy and pretty much I cant wait to go see this in theaters in December it looks really interesting
Congrats Daniel Thrasher 
this is the most deeply uncynical thing Ive seen in a while and Im living for it
I NEED TO SEE THIS MOVIE
Its a great year yet again for Timothee Chalamet Dune 2 coming in November and Wonka in December
I dont think Ive ever been so excited to see a film in my life
I see WOKE
Well most of the cast are British And some are American But when it comes to British they are good of acting
You ruined it with the black
I have started dancing now and once I have started i cant stop awesome
I love the Oompa Loompa scene so much 
im not going to watch it
I am not missing this by any chance So so so happy it popped up out of nowhere and I am surprised and excited and so much 
I like that their doing a prewonka before the chocolate factory thank god its not just another reboot of the same story
Wo ist Johnny Depp 
Is that Rowan Atkinson
We need Rowan Atkinson to reprieve his role in Wonka deriving from his scene in Love Actually
I LIKE HUGH GRANT AS THE OOMPA LOOMPA
omg i cant wait
goto watch is fine acting and sensely entising movie 
Another mkultra trigger
OMG THIS TRAILER IS THE TRAILER OF THE YEAR ITHEJSS
Who is ready to gain some pounds
the first 20 seconds disappointment the next 20 seconds better then up to high grantimpressed after seeing the oompa loompa Im excited to see it
It was such a smart idea to make TC take the role of Willy Wonka in the movie
Wow theres something so magical about the look of this movie Consider me a grown man sold on
Looks good for the kids Shouldve just filmed it where the original was filmed in Germany and went for a similar look rather than the Harry Potteresque look this has
I def did not see timothee playing this role but ok
Hes no Gene Wilder
all ready dont like it to be honest
"Im something of a magician
An OompaWhat now
Cmon man"
""
"Wonkas appearance looks like he was inspired by Tim Burton

Just to avoid making the character look like Gene Wilder because of Hollywoods irrational hatred towards gingers"
Looks like this was made mainly in the UK rather than in Hollyweird Quite a different feel to it with refreshingly subdued ESG
Looks terrible
I know nothing of whos playing willy wonka but I definetly dont like how he reads the script or just how his movements are
""
Rowan Atkinson spotted 
Wow
i love it already
yay
""
"man im so willy

how Willy "
Mr carson retired from downtown abbey to work here
Well heres my dads childhood all over again
I would be more optimistic about this if they had a different lead actor Timothee just feels very miscast His line reads just feel off Someone like Paul Dano probably would have fit better
Another Wonka  No
This actually looks good
actual best trailer i have seen i literally shed tears like this is a must watch for me
Does anyone else think this is gonna be a terrible movie
This looks fun 
ROWAAAAAN
"I dont know I loved the original Truly marvellous movie I was hoping this would inspire me more but I simply didnt find it captured me at all Hugh made it at least a little funny even if the CGI is a bit obvious and he came off looking like a head superimposed on a graphic
I guess Im a little disappointed"
""
Timothe Chalamets portrayal of Wonka is like a perfect fusion of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp
Kinda getting tired of the remakes Is it just me
Oh
I love Willy Wonka
are most of the comments bots Timothees acting is really really bad I agree with others here his range for this role is not there I am not seeing a young version of anything The facial expressions and accents are so inconsistent and subpar
    
Feels kinda pointless for Willy wonka backstory it was kind of the point that we knew little about him I know what burton did however that bit of the movie was actually a homage to his personal life and actual relationship with his parents But I digress I dont think this movie will be bad just kinda pointless rehashing iconic characters in ways that feels manipulative and lazy But still I doubt this movie will be bad
Willie Woker and the shorted shares
This Christmas its only July 
"YESSS  IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THAT TRAILER SINCE LITERALLY THE YEAR 2022 WHEN IT WAS ANNOUNCED  
Well I know what Ill be watching for Christmas "
  
WOOOOO Another banger
This movie looks so insane and I love it
This is how you revisit a classic and its magic without remaking it Disney take notes
Rowan Atkinson in the houuuseee
Okay Im finally going to theatres So excited something worth watching after a long time
This looks like a magical good time Has that Classic WB Movie Feel I love it
Am i the only one expecting a Johnny DeppWonkavibe in here
Johnny Depp 
this is what casting off status over ability turns into timothee has no range and he cant even keep his accent straight 
"Timothee Chalamets delivery as Wonka isnt promising
He doesnt have the confident nonchalance of Wilders Wonka or the barelycontained insanity of Depps
Every line he has in this trailer has an air of timidity He doesnt seem to be comfortable with his own presence on stage in stark contrast to Wilder and Depp who both strut around like own the place

Chalmet was extremely well cast in Dune Paul is an earnest young adult thrust into the heart of conflict with little confidence in his own ability and Timothee brings that energy
Trouble is he seems to be bringing the same energy here to a character who is well established as a cocky eccentric misanthrope
Hed be better cast as Charlie than Willy Wonka

Unless this film can effectively show Wonkas descent into impassioned madness and Chalamet can bring that to his character I dont see this movie going anywhere"
Alan Johnson
102 141 I just found Mr Bean in that movie 
""
Daniel Thrasher
Why remake this film for the 3rd time  Why cant the film makers of today think of something new and why change the story  Also why is Wonka not a Blackman
 
People say I sound like Yeat is that true 
People say I sound like Yeat is that true 
People say I sound like Yeat is that true 
People say I sound like Yeat is that true 
the original willy wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 is one of my favorite movies  Im curious  what is presented to us  although I hate musicals in films
Make something original would you
So its linking back to the Gene Wilder interpretation of Charlie and the Chocolate factory Im generally not that drawn towards Timothy Chalamet bc his characters tend to give off the same brooding moody vibe so Im interested in seeing him a role that intentionally goes against that
At least its not like the last one they made with Johnny Depp that one gave off a lot of pedo vibes
"Roses are red
violets are blue
girls be creaming
When Timothee chalamets
looking at you"
Looks catastrophic All of the magic of the original Roald Dahl book is completely absent and we are left with a harmless parody that looks completely boring Everything feels wrong
"I loved the original Willy Wonka Watched it more times than I can remember growing up

This movie looks terrible Totally not even in the spirit of the original

The last thing I want is to have Willy Wonka ruined by finding out his backstory

Hes not the main character of the story Tell me more about Charlie"
good looking movie and all but how many reruns does this movie really need
Please fix the closed captions
""
"New headcanon 

Willy Wonka Mary Poppins and Nanny McPhee are all related Cousins Halfsiblings But definitely related"
No one can replaced Jhonny depp
Meh Looks corny I will stick to the original fo sho
Again Something new
going to relive my childhood with this prequel
The got the perfect person to play Willy Wonka
whhhhhhhhhhhhhhyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
I saw mrbeen 141
Willy Wonka was Jewish not some rich white boy
Yea Im sorry Im not debating that it could potentially be a very good movie but Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder as professors are just going to be hard to come close to
Looks More like the mad hatter From alice
Hmprequel Might be interesting I like Tim mostly cos hes attractive but thats arguably what makes him less wonka here
Bruuuh shame
im so excited to watch this film 
WONKA is perfect Christmas time movie Easter too
So this is The time before he became a pedophile
Garbage fan service movie
TC as wonka is weird
Awww  I saw the info I this It felt like a Harry Potterinspired movie 
In my opinion he does not fit the role Just not goofy or witty enough He just seems basic
Whoohoo Woke Diversity YESSSSSSS We needed that
Johnny Depp is still my legendary actor
Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompah is perfect I cannot wait for this film
What the hwll is everybody here on about The whimsical nature looks too forced particularly in the acting The film looks mid Which is such a shame i wanna see a novie about a whimsical guy moving into town Why is Wonka even a protagonist he works so much better as a secondary character
Tbh this looks meh Like a Disney movie If youre gonna prequel at least have the decency to keep Gene Wilders dry humor alive Theres barely an ounce of it in there
Cant wait
I cant stand diversity hiring Im out  
bro why is charlie a black girl movie looks woke asf more like willy wokea
Warner Brothers can we please have some more IP with that CU
Good Wonka
          
When I first saw Timothe on the cover I was really skeptical on how it would turn out but now that I see the trailer it actually looks really good and Im excited to see it
Why they got TC as willy wonka what on earth has happened to casting directors doing their jobs
Yeah no I think Im just old now  looks like it sucks 
Grandpa Joe get a Cameo 
""
where the trophy Asian person in this film
Oh my god another one
Even if its minor role its always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films Cant wait to see this one the film captures the spirit of the source material so well 
For a second I thought its Ibrahim
Why are they always exploring his past Why is there even another movie Why are people definitely going to watch this
Mr Beannn ahaha
"The main lead is good But by the voice action and other stuffit strongly remainds me of Jesse Eisenbergplayed lex Luther zombieland now u see me social network

Any one thought of the same"
Hm Not impressed
Tamil dubbed plz
what an abomination of a movie
Just perfect
At this point they be reusing the Paddington actors At least theyre doing one of the three Rs
Looks mid but its got Matt bayton sooooo
The humor and acting already seems stupid in the trailer I fear that the movie wont do that great and a lot of people will definitely be disappointed
Well its obviously a nod to the Gene Wilder Wonka film which is pretty dope
Jesus not another reboot there already was one
"What do you do for living
Currently I dressed up like my ex girlfriends father for living
Do you often do that
Twice
 "
this acting is unbelievably embarrassing
This is awful Johnny Depp Wonka was the best This is just pure cringe 
So this is the prequel
he looks 17  so he spent 7 years 
Timothee Chalamet is this new generations Leonardo DiCaprioHe got a lots of good roles
wow
Aahhh this year gonna be something magical 
This might be great or it might be terrible but probably itll be just meh
Cant wait for this 
This is so soulless and the main actor has as much emotion as a plank of wood
Hang about hang about where is this going Ethan Its just a movie innit mate
wilder was way better 
Why does timothe chalamet look like lil mabu
this actor compared to Wilder is a huge disappointment for this role 
"Its look like a good filmthe sweets that make you fly he was making when Charlie turned up later
And Hugh very funnyI am sure this will smash the box office
I am glad this is before Charlie as I was thinking they would make him a girl or black which he is not neither"
This is gonna be bad
This looks absolutely terrible  Even if it didnt the whole point of Wonkas character is that he has a mysterious past   A prequel ruins the mystique of the character
I was a child used to love Willy Wonka and Charlie and the chocolate Is term 4 school I learn about Charlie and the chocolate factory about characters study and about Augustus gloop then I watch movie in the school for last year
Im keen on Woke Wonka but why arent the oompa loompas black CMON MAN
This looks awful
Oh em gee yeaauus and around Christmas
I cant wait to see the TikTok guy in the bush cut into the film by accident lol 
gee can no one come up with an original movie anymore
Its weird to me that no one is talking about how terrible TC seemed in this trailer Not fit for this role at all it seems other than that looks ok
im gonna watch this movie because mr bean has become a father now
Eh Dialogue is cheesy And Timothee is annoying People must be desperate for a nostalgia film
Trkiyeye ne zaman gelir
This looks horrible
Wow This Looks Mmmmm Good 
No thanks
Yes its a cartel chocolate
Looks absolutely dreadful
Whenever i hear willy wonka Johnny depp always comes to my mind No offense tp the guy playing that role now and i can see hes doin a pretty good job but johnny was the best actor for that role still
Looks fun

I always want to know how wonka life began It like a whole new chapter where he make good chocolate for people who love his chocolate  and  make a  that how you you know it good chocolate
Cant wait 
Hey thats Keegan from Key and Peele as the police officer
Nice trailer excited
the movie i wasnt expecting tbh but then again theres already at least two others so why not
I smell a Stinkerootm
seeing wonka as such a young person throws me off because all of the other movies hes older
Its a 0 in tha comparison  to johnny depp movie
Nah Willy Wonka will forever be represented by Gene Wilder in memoriam
Very interesting
Are they going to just wave alway his slave force
Wonka Atreides
Okay Wilder and Depp as someone in the comments has noted had an edge They both had that captivating edge about them revolving around Wilders mistrust and Depps upbringing it made them not only captivating but mysterious and unpredictable in a way Timothee in this movie does not have that A lot of people see it as a casting issue but in reality this might be a character writing issue The movie couldve still been PG and released on Christmas but they couldve added an edge I know the term edge is broad but thats all Willy Wonka really needs Yes Timothee is playing the character as intended and i guess so is the script but lets be real did a majority of us watching really feel captivated and interested in Wonka watching this trailer Me personally watching this trailer just made me want to watch the older versions again Im no expert on Willy Wonka by any means so take this with a grain of salt but it seems that theyve had all the time in the world to make this prequel over a decade and they couldve done something really great with it potentially even groundbreaking for a pg movie everyone that watched the old ones if this trailer had the it factor would go watch this It couldve even been up there for movie of the year i mean the potential is unmatched and im just a little disappointed Maybe ill eat my words maybe i wont if you read this far there was probably no need lol
Use me as a DISLKIE button
Anything made by Liberals  Democrarats will always be titled DUMB
I dont think the main actor is suitable to play the role of young willy wonka Johnny acting was a whole new level
Just stop and do something original I beg of you
Im surprised they didnt make wokna black and female
Wonka  Chocolate Beast and where to find them
only in theaters gotta wait for hbo for another one or two yrs 
      
This looks awful Jesus
nah
Nice 
hes really the Lisan AlGhaib
Ommpa looompa was missing
Whos up wonking their willy rn
SUPERRRRBBBBBBB I CANT WAIT 
Wowwsuper coolI like itthanks
This looks cool Im definitely looking forward to it
This movie is my childhood Im definitely going to go see this I seen the original then the remake now this one is going to be epic
Wowpass
This kid doesnt have the chops to pull off Willy Wonka Gene Wilder And Depp had the acting abilities this kid might do better as a Ken in the Barbie Movie
Theres something different about this  it kind of exubarates hope and happiness  Its rare nowadays 
This looks horrible
A prequel to the 1970s Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory Cant wait
This is surprisingly amazing
HATE
It looks like an SNL sketch
Well no one is saying it it looks like a disaster waiting to happen Could not even finish the trailer it was so cringy
Timothy chalamet as Willy Wonka is a definite good casting call
Im just glad Im old enough to remember when films were good Hollywood is 100 stuck in a post creative age at this point
MAJOR cinematic risk and shoes to fill with Gene Wilder AND Johnny Depp Cant wait to see how and if the challenge was properly met
hes cute but hes emotionless
If youre gonna remake this movie again you should put Johnny Depp in it This looks stupid
Paddington  Harry Potter How can this be anything but magic
"A retarded actor 
Woke casting 
DOA"
If its Willy Wonka then YES   If its going to be Willy Wokea then yeah   Take a pass on that
Hes like a mixture of gene wilder and johnny depps ver of willy wonka
The origin of willy Wonka that something im interested in seeing Expansions into classic stories are far better than low effort remakes
"ughhhhhh arghhhhhhhh noooooooooooooo
Suddenly the johhny depp one doesnt look so bad
1 Only gene wilder can be Willy Wonka no one else knows how
2 Replacing charlie bucket for some black girl to fill diversity quotas is pathetic
3 Every scene was boring or cringe
Let this garbage flop folks speak with your money"
No one can beat Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka
This actually looks really good
Willy wonka has always creeped me tf out i get john wayne gaycee vibes 
"DID NO ONE CATCH THE PHRASE HE USED 

Scratch that reverse

THATS GENE WILDERS WONKA LINE

IM SOO STOKED THEYRE GOING WITH THE OG "
Well clearly far far overdone in the insanity department and Chalamet looks like hes performing in a high school play  What are the odds this will be even halfway watchable
Who noticed MrBean
Another Warner Bros flop for 2023 Theyre having a bad year
ew
I thought they might make a new Willy wonka
Johnny Depp did it best
se ve muy buena
What is this I was hoping for something better Gene Wilder was weird Johnny Depp was weird This guy has a soft voice and is like a young Wonka was splashed by some Disney mahic dust and lost his weird creepy smart Wonka charm Ill pass
Sorry Ive already started dancing now Once we started we cant stop 
I think were all watching just to see High Grants Oompa Loompas
142 Mr Bean
Timothee Chalamet is a competent actor though I wish it had been Johnny Depp
"This Is Going To Be Epic

Johnny Depp can eat my shorts"
"You lost me after chocolate cartel 

So dumb "
AHHHH IM GONNA LOVE ITT
Eagerly waiting for it
140 if you pause Rachel is in the movie get the joke 
I like the scene where mr bean says put away your willy wonka truly one of the movies of all time
We all wanted this movie but now the trailer is out and we decide that we didnt need it
Who is that DILF in green though
Absolutely not
Am I the only one who feels like willys mother looks familiar
I cant believe how much Matthew Baynton is in this trailer And Simon Farnaby has top writing credit I cant wait Any fans of bbc Ghosts will know how good those guys are and if theyre acting writing in it its gotta be good
Okay but Johnny Depp  I aint feeling this willy to be wonka enough   no hate but really 
Nice trailer
ive watched this trailer so many times I have everything memorized lol so good I cant wait to watch the whole thing
Absolute atrocity to a good movie   You couldnt pay me to watch this movie
Extremely lame that they used such a mild color palette and ran the entire movie through an amber filter Willy Wonka is supposed to be eye bleedingly colorful Hollywood just continues to mess up visual design over and over and over with very few exceptions
Through trailer i feel its will be amazing
This looks terrible
"Big Lemony Snicket series energy
not an insult"
There werent this many blacks in england at this time  Woke bs
Bro Just Turned Williy Wonka Into A MCU Movie 
so happy this isnt another remake  cant wait to see it
kisi ne Candy Crush ka music suna 
Oh my gosh I never thought he would be the perfect Willy Wonka But chefs kiss
Willy wonka chocolate factory is the best hope johnny deep play the role but give other artist to shine
Johnny and Freddie 
Boring boring boring bring back johnny deep my god
Im so happy they are the original Oompa Loompas and not the ones from the Johnny depp version I love he is dressed like a young gene wilder SO EXCITING and a great way to pay tribute to an amazing man
Wonkas villain origin story I love it
"I liked both movies equaly but I always thought Charlie and the chocolate factory was the better one to make a sequelprequel out of just because of all the extra lore they added Plus its newer idk how to explain

This is giving me vibes of like how they made a new wizard of Oz movie and they made a new Mary Poppins movie If I remember correctly both of those were prequels"
Meh
""
I am so excited for this  LOVE Timothy Chalamet
i can smell the simps
Oh Hugh Grant Is he a thing again
this is a good mix of magical and whimsical
Nooooooooooo
Wow Amazing some childhood memories 
Rowan Atkinson is Back  
i just threwup in mouth a little
Rowan Atkinson voice  heard
Jhonny Depp was the best Wonka
This looks exciting but why do I have a feeling that Wonka will turn out to be a villain lol
This should be a crime
Im so excited 
this looks like a Harry Potter movie
REGULUS WHAT R U DOING
Never expected that Timothee Chalamet got Wonka roles but I dont have any complaints 
Cant lie I dont care for this movie but that shot where it transitions from daydreaming to normal was unreal
I dont like what wb did to J Depp  Not supporting this company
Johnny depp was the legend
I love his lack of whimsy A great new take on this classic tale
Looks pretty mid Ill give it a watch when it releases for sure
For me its always johny depp but yes this looks good too
So many boys commenting on this video its pathetic
She Wonkad on my Willy till I Oompa Loompad in her Chocolate Factory
ok let see what you guys give us
Edit this the prequel
How many times are we going to see the same thing being remade over and over and over again
Guys I just saw Mr Bean in this movie at 103
im so tired of seeing this mfs face everywhere
I dont know if this makes sense but timothee is too handsome and happy  I dont feel the mysterious vibe I got from Wiily Wonka
The male Mary Poppins LOL 025 147
This is what real cinema looks like Magic is about to happen  Christmas is finally going to feels like a Christmas
theres a lot of great things in this trailer but its giving me more Johnny Depp Wonka rather than Gene Wilder Wonka
I was all in when i see the Producer of Harry Potter 
Good no agenda from the community
idk how I feel about this I thought Johnny Depps version made it quite clear how Wonka became a chocolate maker
id rather go see barbie
The queen matida move 
Another franchise ruined
This is going to be a huge success
Is that mr beanbeam 142
Cute
Wowowowowowowoowowow
Last time we got Lord Grantham in Paddington now we got Mr Carson here
Sharing
i was not expecting to be this excited for this movie
OMG Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa lol
Too much black
This looks terrible
"Please makeoriginal movies Original movies as inoriginal characters that are not already characters in other movies Pleasedo you guys need to mix your cocaine with dmt or something Wheres the original ideas 

Hard pass for me I want something that isnt an offshoot of a different movie 

Probably why I havent gone to the theaters for years"
Gonna watch only for Hugh Grant as the oompa loompa Cracked me up
"Cant wait to see this  
Sooo excited "
Wow Okay this actually looks pretty good
12 yo me when i watched  Charlie and the chocolate factory in 2015
Is that JOHNSON
Timothee Chalamet is playing the main role in more and more movies Wow respect
Chalamet seems like a miscast Hes honestly the worst part in this trailer imo I liked everything else especially the set design
I never thought I would find Willy Wonka hot but here we are
I was very skeptical of this Timothy boi playing the chaharcter but from watching the trailer looks like he did a pretty good job for this role
Doesnt seem too bad
This is just what we need Great Actor that fits the perfect role Would be interesting to see how Willy Wonka came to be
Bro this is as woke as it couldd possibly get  dudes really tryin to replace depp Man
The fact that people dont realize that this is made to be a woke version than actual an art of a movie  This is why we are where we are in America God help us
The woke industry is destroying movies If actors are selected based on being an African it becomes the worst form of racism These unheard of black actors are not even that good they just seem to be the convenient ones
"Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Ninja Turtle

Seriously though why did these woke fckheads have to replace Charlie with a little miss ebony"
The fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Glad I could hear pure imagination on the big screen again
No one can replace Johnny Depp
Why is this a thing We dont need another Willy Wonka film
Gene Wilder is spinning in his grave SMH
yuck why would u mess with the johnny D version
No
WHEN HE SAID I rebel I CLAPPED
So the backstory that nobody asked for completely changing the image of the character from what it was in the original movie Yeah makes sense
Im sure they must have done a marvellous job in directig this film but the sheer magnitude of big actors casted in this film just to support Timothy just goes to show the sheer lack of talent in his own right You can remake all the movies that stared Johnny Depp but nothing will ever surpass the success of his film Depp is pure talent that no fresh blood good looks and star studded support can subdue Let see if your CGI can help 
""
Im glad willy wonka lives on for a new generation
looks pretty bad ngl
I am something of a magician myself
Mid
I havent even finished the trailer and I can tell you Chalamet missed the mark I was optimistic Movie looks good but him not so much
A movie that we dont really want but theyre giving it to us because laziness has a become a big thing in hollywood
Better be cameo of real Wonka candy Like the commercial Wonka candies
The reason we cant see dislikes lol

This looks super fun  Hugh Grant as the Oompas YES Keegan M Key AND Mr Freakin Bean BUT one thing Even though Tim is the man They really dropped the ball by NOT making Gene Wilders old character  Jeremy Allen White I mean cmon Theyre practically twins Plus dudes already blowing Up after Shameless  now the bear Im still checking this out though 
MID
At least another iconic character hasnt been black washed thats enough for me to watch it
Excited I just hope that boring Willy Wonka impersonator on TikTok does show up more for me after this
This looks terrible Theyre doing magic candies now instead of science based research and development candy that took Wonka decades to figure out  ugh And what is with this over the top score Its all wrong
Nope
Ive never heard of this story Has it been told before
Who  it a no
Too many black people Pass
lol saw this back in cinemacon seeing hugh grant as oompa loompa always cracked me up
"What are you doing Wonka
looks directly at the camera
Making chocolateremember cuz from the movie AND LOOK ITS AN OOMPA LOOMPA HORRAY"
nope you guys should have begged johnny depp instead
ummmmm pass
I really hope they release Wonka bars because of this movie Really miss those things
I didnt see this coming 
Another original idea from Hollywood
Wow this looks like the brown stuff  and I dont mean chocolate
I love this
Ooooa black person Cant wait for the angry keypad warriors to join the chat
It looks okay but I dont like the tiny cgi oomph loompa Its uncanny compared to the original
Snowpiecer Prequel  Thumbs Up If You Get This Reference
One of the most beloved classics is coming back with the origin story of willy wonka Ive seen the movies both willy wonka and Charlie and the chocolate factory Ive read the book and I seen it on Broadway and this is next Christmas as come early this year
Looks funbut what is going on Who cares you millennial kahoots my ticket and find remaking movies with codes matters Lolthe 1st 2 will always be the best Any originals now daysits like hollywood twilight zone
"Idk about this
Part of the charm of the book OG movie and even the remake was just how crazy and magical Wonka and his factory was compared to the relatively normal mundane outside world Here the outside world already seems crazy and not at all serious so theres no contrast
Also why change the origin of the OompaLoompas Wonka was supposed to have met them for the first time in Loopaland Here one is following him around for some reason"
Its like hes channeling Gene Wilder Awesome
 
"I am YouTuber 
 youTuber 
 mera Tach channal Hai
   
mere channel se Aapke Help Ho Sakata Hai
       "
   
129 this line is my reaction to timothee acting as Willy Wonka 
Willy wonka Walter white
it was STRIKE that reverse it this will do a disservice to Gene Wilder
Do not want
not hugh grant being hired to play an oompa loompa
Missing Jhonny depp as willy wonkaa
Really looks horrible especially whatever the leads trying
yes
"W W I mean who do you figure that is Woodrow Wilson Willy Wonka Walter White
 Huh You got me "
"A totally normal day when the policemen just say

Nothing to see here just a small group of people defining the laws of gravity  113"
Gene Wilder would NOT approve
Do todays generation children even believe these kinda stuff like we 90s kid did
Bless Richard Dreyfuss
this is going to bomb watching the trailer is like watching Styrofoam made out of static noise A lot of these top comments write like bots
"with Tim in it

Ill support this movie and watch it"
I know what the music is referencing but it still sounds like jurassic world trailer at the beginning
What a waste of money
at least people wont say johnny depp is the worst wonka now
"041 Penalty for day dreaming
In which country"
Kinoteatrda baxmaq lazmd mtlqq
Gba
WTF IS THIS
Gene Wilders Wonka was kind of dark and unhinged Roald Dahls work had a strong hint of cynicism and black humour as well as magic and wonder This film just seems twee Chalamet is trying too hard to be whimsical with none of Wilders edge
Too late Ive started dancing now When we start we cant stop
Suprised Wonka isnt a black woman
"A prequel to Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory Amazing Astonishing

Something to really look forward to"
IS THAT MR BEANNNNN
 It looks good to me  But I love Willy Wonka
Might actually give this a chance since its written and directed by the guy who did Paddington
""
Why did they cast this guy 
Timothee
TIMOTHEES ACTING IS SOO GOOD
These idiots have no new ideas And they think we will pay for it  Lol
definetly gonna watch this bc of keygan rowan atkinson dan hugh grant lol
Oompa Loompas i dont undertsand em they are working for white Willy for free cause he is such a nice guyleaving theire country cause it is fun to produce chocolate i think history teached us it didnt work that way I want ooma loompas in charge world wide i think that would be even more fun
Why is he talking like a Dr Suess character
Timothy chalamet better than mr beast 
first time ive ever seen tim chalamet smile
That sure is a lot of black people for early 20th century England
the film communities when they realize this movie isnt for them but for children o
The Harry Potter reference in the suit at 109 is such a cute easter egg
Is it just me or is this role not at all for timothee chalamet He just doesnt have it lol
The basic reality that this is coordinated by the person who did the two Paddington films is sufficient to inspire me to watch this Those movies were outright showstoppers of exhibitions narrating and heading
brooooooo another one whyyyyyyyyyyyyy
Im sorry but if he doesnt kill some kids is it really willy wonka
Beautiful Bravo Cant wait for this magical movieThank you 
Im definitely going to go and see this movie And ya just know it will be fantastic
I wish it wasnt a musical
cool
And then a lifetime later he goes on to make a contest where he brutally traumatizes 4 children and then gives his factory to a poor kid
OMg Rowen Atkinson Is Playing Willy wonka WOW
This looks so bad
Another box office BOMB
It just keeps getting worse
Why do i remember ollie wonka from boys planet lmao
Roald Dahl made Wonka very mysterious Thats the point of him Tim Burton made his own origin story Now we have a origin story of Wonka Yeah Im not watching this I prefer to keep Willy Wonkas origin story a  mystery to me This is why Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me His story is almost at a no origin story So I rather keep it that way Not every character has to have an origin story Some things are best left alone and should stay that way
This looks terrible
Bro actually said Put my thang down flip it and reverse it
No thanks Ill watch the scenes of Hugh Grant on youtube and that about does it
Idk
Hmmmm
I feel like Hugh grant was the only good part of this tbh
Not another one cant they come up with anything new just keep rehashing old movies boring
Omggggg
"A double huh 
I got an idea"
grat
I hope no LGBTQ kind of thing in this masterpiece cause i just want to enjoy the story and moment
""
Why are there a bunch of Sub Saharan Africans in the film
Where my Mexican  people at All I see is white and black
This looks stupid Not wonka at all Dead in the water This is more magic then candies
I dont remember so many Africans in the Willy Wonka tale
I cant believe the comments Im reading in this comment section This movie looks aweful and it will be absolutely terrible
Should have taken johnny dep as the wonka 
   
Who decided that this movie needed to exist This is the most easily predictable flop
Nope
holy this looks really bad like i almost couldnt imagine a worse concept or worse cast especially in this climate where so many movies are flopping
I think people who are hating on this movie already look too hard into every detail I grew up reading the book and watching both movies Im honestly happy that theyre expanding on one character who is so magical and fantastic that you wanna know how he got started I think it adds something interesting to the history of one of if not the best childrens stories ever told I hope this movie does amazing because people need something to dream of again and the only person who can make dreams come true is the one and only Willy Wonka
Is that Mr frickin bean
when
OkHugh grant as an oompa loompa was something I never knew I needed 
They couldve kept this honestly
This shoulda been a wes anderson movie idc
This is definitely not my kind of movie but since Hugh Grant is an Ommpa Lommpa I will definitely go  watch it
Ah yes the little orphan african girl in London spunky sidekick helps the inept hero overcome all odds
I hate willy wonka 
In this era of absolute abuse of CGI and visual effects all these movies lose their original script magic to become just choreographed shows of nonsense Chalamet can hardly match the insanity of Gene Wilder Even the Johnny Depp one was at least acceptable because he did his character very weird as usual and that was ok for what you expect in Wonka But this one is just trying to be cute Thats not the spirit
""
mr bean its here
Getting desperate for entertainment or what Screech is Wonka
Itd be funny if someone did a horror edit of Wonka taking away all the Oompa Loompas from the wild and locking them up to work in a Victorian era chocolate factory
I LOVE WONKA CANDY CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS MOVIE
Might be alright Although I wish Hollywood would come out with something new instead of reusing the same old stuff Also I just dont see this guy as willy Wonka He just doesnt fit the script for me personally It seems way too forced
Am I the only one that does not like Timothy as Willy wanka like his acting does not seem like it fits the role well 
Do black people ever get to have original movies or do they always get sloppy seconds
Yeesh  Not sure this was casted well
The black colead and cast are there to satisfy diversityinclusion clauses Im not at all saying it is wrong or ignoble Only that its intentional With that in mind good luck fully immersing yourself in this fantasy while you watch
ok
this ad bumped outta nowhere into my face while i was trying to watch spider man doing miles mom
i dont want u are ruin my life
No
Ummmm Im unreasonably excited about this
Is this going to have musical numbers
Im missing Johnny Depp 
Im not opposed to it
This dude is definitely not the right actor for Willy wonka
This is just Cruella for bottoms
I dont know how to feel about this Nothing will  beat the classic  Just saying
Oh god I can hear the TikTok thirst edits already
Black co star for inclusion sake
OMG the prequel I never thought I needed bla bla bla bla tears OMG
Ill only watch this for Hugh Grant
Wow cool film 
Willy Wonka and the chamber of secrets
Once we started we cant stop Immediately sing a song while a child is being traumatized and humiliated
Coca king
Yes yes absolute yes
Rowen Atkison Great Just wish he had a bigger part he is hilarious
Dentist tooth fairy son hes a nympoh no
I get strong RDJ in Mr Willowbys Christmas Tree energy here which is a very good thing
Hard Pass due to no inclusion of little people one of the most marginalized groups in society This makes me very sad Its not just about the money the little people could have earned Its also about who wouldnt want to be in a big movie and have something to share with your family for generations 
Where is Johnny Depp
I knew nothing of this movie until today Wasnt sure about it until I saw Hugh Grant  Im in
   MEH Looks like a mixed bag Ill wait until the second week if people report what I THINK theyll report Im done donating my hard earned money to the first week of mediocre movies The only thing in this trailer that wows me is the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa That gave me warm fuzzies I gotta say 
Im only in it for Sally hawkins
Isnt Willy Wonkaevil Doesnt he kill kids At least shouldnt we see him that way
Sooo its a nonmusical Jingle Jangle starring Timothy chalomet OK
Another IP crushed Onto the next
I normally hate the hurr durr the trailer showed the entire story comment you see but unfortunately hurr durr they really did show the entire story here didnt they
Johnny Depps performance of Willy Wonka will always be my favorite
what is wrong with you
Timothe will be indeed one of the greats of our times And I have the privilege to grow up in such a time
Discover how Willy became Wonka is my new favorite line now
Im still waiting for Dune 2 haha
Meh
omg rowan atkinson
This trailer reminds me of Charlie and the chocolate factory 
OMGSweet Tea
he was dating with captain Sparrows daughter and now starred in a film that Sparrow had starred in
No thank you I do not need a prequel
"Chalamet was awesome in the king and dune

But this looks like a miscast"
Its almost as if Hollywood is unable to imagine a fictional world without 21st century American demographics
"why do they have to show so much in trailers i feel like the movie isnt even worth watching any longer

cool he made chocolate that made people fly

why should i watch the movie now they just revealed some of the most climactic part of the movie"
009013 Ive read the original charlie and the chocolate factory many times growing up and i dont really remember wonka saying things like thatso im assuming that this is a tribute to gene wilder
Honestly I think Tom wouldve been a better fit
Ffs another prequel Come on
Is there a soundtrack for this on Spotify
They really could have gotten actual little people to play the Oompa Loompas but otherwise this looks interesting
""
Looks very cute
Needs more artificially injected minorities Not woke enough just to add a female black sidekick
At least there wont be any cursed gum this time around right right
This is a movie we dont need Just this trailer breaks cannon Im not looking forward to more of this
ALL THE ENGLISH GREATS and the greatest American amongst them of course cant wait to see this
I know what I am going to see on my next birthday 
Im realize if Johny depp be more amazing after seing this
Didnt know mabu acted
Only watching it for Timothee Chalamet lol
Looks like trash Its gonna bomb at the box office for sure
Damnthese comments are sus
Yikes Hard pass
Despus de tantos filtrajes finalmente sucedi Le voy a dar una oportunidad slo por estrenarse en Diciembre
No
Wheres the part with Willy getting ready for combat saying to the other chocolatiers May your ladles chip and shatter
""
Lolyeah its really hard to sell chocolate that makes you fly
i love thisssss because i hate previous willy wonka cause its look creepy the vibe i really hate it
Aw heck yeah the Germans got me interested
Weird seeing Paul atreides in Willy wonka
I didnt want to like it as I have grown up with Roalds versionbut I have to say I like it Cant wait to watch it
Seems strange there are no bad reviews Ill be different Doesnt look good to me at all The lead looks like a guy trying to be Willy Wonka but really isnt i have no desire to see this at all Cringe
I bet Mr Wonka doesnt know what county chocolate was discovered in haha I do 
Oh snap they remastered the original Willy Wonka Its a actual Christmas miracle thats the time itll play nearby
Finally a positive portrayal of a talented entrepreneur fighting against the economically inefficient cartel while promoting the evergreat and ancient idea of dreams come true and dreaming is good and all of that in the modern day and age  I am very pleasantly surprised Cheers
Ill enjoy it if Im on drugs
Lets just hope its not some Disney remake
Maybe its just me I am traveling and working without break It felt home watching this Not sure why
cant wait
This is terrifying   It looks good  Really good   So many bad movies lately but I havent seen a trailer thats gotten me this excited in a long time   BRING IT
Did i see Mall Cop
soundtrack is going to be extra chocolatey
The guy who made the hilarious to Paddington movies wrote this All I needs to know
"AAAAA AKHIRNYAAA
DITUNDA MULU SOALNYA TAYANGNYA
AKHIRNYA BENERAN JADI TAYANG 
AKHIR TAHUN INI






















kayanya Timy bisa dapat peran ini selain emang karakternya cocok sama Timy juga karena Timy pernah pacaran sama Lily anaknya Johnny depp ga sih kek bisa pas gitu hahaha soalnya ditahun yang sama pas Timy pacaran sama Lily disitu juga ada tawaran film ini hehe"
TC is playing the character as intended as someone who is quirky and intelligent who is very forward but also has a huge heart  As a prequel I can get behind this
Thanks I hate it
"LETS GET THIS STRAIGHT
THIS IS A British version with American accents "
"If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then theres no stopping him
You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka"
This actor is not quirky enough to be Willy Wonka
Something about his eyes aint selling it for me Like he doesnt believe hes Willy Wonka
TAKE MY MONEY
To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
I could have done without Timothee Dont know why hes everywhere
Something I never thought I wanna see a Willy Wonka prequel
ANOTHER WILLY WONKA YES
this guy already looks more subtle than johnny depp
Wowvery mediorce acting for a leading role
Wow another remake from Hollywood  Didnt see that coming
Who wonking they willy right now
Only pirate actor can do better than this
Cant wait for this
Yo tom holland wouldve been perf
This looks exciting and did I spy Hugh Grant Dan Foglar and Rowan Atkinson Love the cast
Two words come to mind forced whimsy
i hope you all enjoy this im gonna pass
Well thanks for showing me the whole movie
thats a big old nope
i CANT CRINGE HARD ENOUGH  THIS IS GROSS
i gotta be honest nothing against timothee chalamet but he just doesnt seem like a good fit for this role to me
Did ChatGPT change strike that to scratch that
Once weve started we cant stop hahahahaha
Childish trailer not official
not my wonka
Only thing that throws me off is we have to find out what happened to the little girl why isnt she with Wonka anymore at the time of Charlie And The Chocolate Factory Shouldve been the guy who played the role of Slugworth to try and trick the kids
Oh Johnny
When will we see him turn into the sociopath child mutilator murder we know and love
im so proud of timmy
Im gonna say it this movie looks awful
Needs more diversity and LGBARF representation
So Whats up with these top comments and their profile pictures on a trailer for a childrens movie And they each have multiple highly upvoted comments Also many of these comments have replies that all have a random string of lettersnumbers Its like someones using YouTube comments like a numbers station
the scratch that reverse it had me READY to watch this guys fr i cannot wait lol
I came to the comments to look for some Dune Memes
HUGH GRANT
bro im afraid of the chocolate cartel
I was skeptical when I saw the preview on Instagram but Im all in
Hugh oomph loompa is going to be hilarious Have a good feeling about it
ayeee i was scared to have a trash charlie  the chocolate factory reboot but a willy wonka origin story is sooo dope asf
"Oh gee Another movie weve seen before
Wouldnt want to ever pay an writer again now would we
Staff writers forever Stale plots twisted to male a political point Yay"
The new annie movie looks lit
"After seeing this was an actual movie one thought came into my mind


Dear Hollywood







Its over"
Cant believe timothe is almost 30 he dont look like it he looks like a teenager
lmao at Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean playing a priest
Cringe such an unnecessary movie Another woke movie where they have to force inclusivity smh
Yup definitely a movie id go to the theater to watch for sure too bad i have to wait till Christmas time but ill try to remember to look out for it in the coming months
Hey Hank we found your W W  Heisenberg  
Se ve prometedora esta reinvencin
To be honest I think Id watch that just out of curiosity Timothee was great in Dune
so they already screwed up replacing a soda that makes you fly with chocolate Damnit Warner Brothers This is why DC movies fail
no movie in the recent decade has had me this hyped This actually looks really good
I AM A CHOCOLATERE I AM A CHOCOLATERE I AM A CHOCOLATERE MR WONG
If only Gene Wilder was here to see this RIP
Okay that actually looks really fun
Is it Charlie and the chocolate factory sequel prequel
I like thats its a prequel Ill go see it on Christmas 
Looks interesting
""
So clearly the story is narrated by Hugh Grant Which would make the original Wonka cannon Which means the black girl end up dying somewhere at some time because shes not in the future installments
WHY Another one JesusThey all sucked
This is one of those movies youll only ever see in parts at family get togethers when they need to put something on for the kids
omg hugh grant hahahah was not expecting that
Thank god they still put matt lucas as a cast what a magical person he is 
Okay Hollywood this looks good  So far have two movies that I will go see in theaters and this is one of them
I prefer matt lucas playing oompa loompas at first but hugh grant actually gave us OOMPA LOOMPASSSSS
Well Tim seems to be the Johnny deep of our Generation and I aint mad about it 
 His acting is so stiff 
Is this a musical Wack
anyone hating needs to stop watching kids movies expecting a not kids movie
Im going to call a flop right now  I dont see how anybody would want to watch some sort of prequel to the books  I mean whats next A life story of The Phantom of the Opera guy 
I remember being traumatized by what little I saw of the old version when I was a kid
I dont like his voice Trying to hard Sounds stale and fake
pass
Hope he knows its a never match to GWs WW  hey Read the book
hmmm not feeling him as Wonka lol voice doesnt match
Im already living
We lived long enough to witness a willy wonka prequel
Why is everything now days a sequel of something made already Cant they just get creative and stop ruining old classics This movie looks Like a Gimmick
Not remotely reminiscent in tone or spirit to the original story This looks awful
I have to say at least they LOOKED like the original movie oompa loompas and that was kind of funny with Hugh Grant once we start we cant stop
Maybe if you made it look stylistically like the old movie id probably watch it The score cgi and vibe contrast the original This just feels like a modern movie not a prequel to a classic of cinema
No day dreamingdont give legislators ideas
Bro oompa loompas terrify me
""
broooo im stocked
Looks cool Now start paying your writers
Nope  forced diversity casting that doesnt match the era 
A movie nobody ask for
I didnt know Wonka was Italian
This looks so good
Just what we needed a diverse the patriarchy are stopping the world from being rainbow flagged movie No thanks
"WRONG No HECK NO 

so woke took over this movie and after they change words in Rauld Dahls books now its selfish woke blm saying lets take every good movie made and completely take over the entertainment industry How much does anyone want to bet that the Language has been changed 

little mermaid teenage mutant annie are other examples

So i take it Tiana pochahontas jasmine moana esmerelda and all those disney characters are not enough either 
oh and lets not forget how caucasians cant get a part now because CHANGE

well if you want to support racism go ahead but I am well above and far from that You cant make new movies now entertainment industry Have you even tried nope Woke is in the entertainment industry And if we dont start saying something Many more beloved actors and actresses will not get parts Well Im done with your racism woke and BLM Im done lgbtq for your lame excuse to put aMAN into a WOMANS sport He was being LAZY and didnt want to try just like woke is doing to these movie remakes 

Go WATCH Sound Of Freedom Its based on a true story about child trafficking and it deserves your attention 
If you dont want to gain your own opinion that is your option I obviously cant make you do anything But if you want to support BLM WOKE AND ANy Political idea Bless your heart 

Here are movies that had a lead african american role or co stars that were good to my memory
I am legend independence day CHICAGO the musical Rent the musical  cool runnings the A team DIEHARD Men in Black Jumanji pursuit of happiness eddie remember the titans the birdcage and more

But you just gotta decide for yourself what made the movie good Was it because politics were involved or was it because of being artistic and there were a wide variety in the cast how about a new story or Good vs evil good wins 

But this is where I draw the line and yall better not even touch shell silverstiene books Taylor swift already has a golden book YEah A GOLDEN BOOK the kid books  WHAT THE HECK 

THIS HAS GOT TO STOP and if noone will say it I WILL 
A photo just black and white is black and white kind of boring sometimes but when you have all the colors the image is beautiful  THINK ABOUT THAT WORLD"
This movie looks absolutely trash
hey greg
Looks great Pay your writers
I didnt expect it to look so good now I cant wait
Cant wait to see how he enslaved the Oompa Loompas
I can tell you right now that hes not the one to play Wonka Hes gonna blow this movie
My favorite part of the movie is when he said Its Wonking time And then he wonked all over the place
Its gonna be magical 
I cant wait
Loveee it already Looks like Peter Pan or the Witches Wardrobe 
Why
Honestly this looks terrible
Enough recycling stories for biopics Lame
This is the best thing since everlasting gobstoppers
The beginning of the trailer I was like eh By the end I was like yep
Hard pass on yet ANOTHER cheap reboot  Call me when they make something new creative and inspiring
So is he a sorcerer
Oh Lord its woke Guess they should change the name to WOKA
"um tell me this is one of those fake made by a fan  trailer spoofs

seriously ANOTHER Wonka movie 

cant Hollywood come up with ANYTHING new"
Why did they have to pick him bro
"Me Theres no way another movie franchise can be ruined

2023 Hold my Indiana Jones"
I love a good origin story
It should be Carmy from the bear as wonka
Why are they remaking everything This is ridiculous Where are the writersssss
Gawd WOKE off the bat
"ISNT THE POINT OF WILLY WONKA THAT HES ECCENTRIC IN A WORLD THAT IS DRAB AND REALISTIC
WHY IS THEIR WORLD SO FANTASTICAL
CHOCOLATE CARTEL

WHICH NEPOBABY GREENLIT THIS"
Nice
It will be fun watching what the online reviewers do with this one Keep em coming The swill must flow
Oh wow this looks really good seriously hoping it does not disappoint
Fantastic Oompa Loompas and Where to Find Them
another remake did people lose their creativity 
This comment section is infested with bots Turn back now
Its supposed to be Willy wonky not Harry Potter
Hes giving Nikola Tesla not willy wonka
This looks absolutely abysmal
When I see this trailer the first character that appeared in my mind is Jhony Deep
Chalamet is a splendid actorbut why am I wondering what D Radcliffe could have done with this role cast and director
At first I was like Timothee seems so serious I cant see him as Willy Wonka But now that I see the trailer I know hes gonna be AMAZING
We are going to get everything but the origin to the Tunnel
Finally we can fix what Johnny Depp f up  This is what it should have been  This kids gonna crush it 
this trailer threw me off his facial expressions and movements feel heavily edited but im assuming its to add onto his character so weird
 this doesnt seem as great as I hoped it would be I guess Gene Wilder just ruined it for all the predecessors because this feels lacking
"DECEMBER 15thats too long 
cries"
the black girl makes no sense in the movie
I didnt think it was possible to make the Burton version look good But they did it TC is a good actor but god damn talk about miscasting
Meh
Shocked to say this looks pretty decent  Itll never touch the original  But the director of Paddington is the right guy for the job
why do some of the scenes look like theyre set in the ministry of magic  lol
we finally get a sane willy again
142 Mr Bean
Please God stop remaking movies and rewriting legacy characters to be nothing like themselves
He is NOT Wonka
Every Good thing started with a dream so you hold on to yours
    
me after viewing this trailer  you get NOTHING you LOSE good day sir I will not be seeing this sir WB Sorry
I ran to this at the speed of Matthew Baynton
He is literally copying Johnny Depps way of talking for this movie but worse this doesnt even need to happen
I want his chocolates 
Im over here smiling and tearing up at the same time I absolutely cant wait
Its story is done come up with something new
none of these comments are real bffr rn with me this looks bad timothee peace and love is not camp enough for this
Timothy as wonka Can this rewrite my childhood
I thought Mr Bean was dead
nojustno
"Where is Johnny Depp 
I like Johnny for Willy Wonka"
Chalamet is horrible Whats wrong with you people
This is so strange Wouldnt the origin story of Willy Wonka be dark Hes practically a villain Hes enslaved a tribe of small people to make his chocolate and seems to despise children and the people trying to steal his chocolate Isnt that what makes his character so interesting He makes a product for a consumer he hates I want to see the origin of THAT
Another leftie destruction of a classic
Acting seems real bad pass
Whoa the first Chalamet picture I am completely disinterested in
Its kinda sad to see johnny depp and that other dude not as wonka but he still looks cool
This is going to be woke and pointless
Omg this look absolutely horrendous hahahahahaha Its almost as if Hollywood is incapable of making anything good now Bahhhh
Maybe its just me just Timmy just isnt quirky enough for this movie
Yehhhh No None of this is in the original novel Too much blatant blackwashing of history too
What a load of absolute shite bollocks
He seems like a kid compared to Johnny depp he just looks so young 
MATTHEW BAYNTON
"When I was a child the original Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite movie I would watch it every day multiple times a day and make my whole family watch with me Most of my family got tired of me asking them to rewatch it for the 100th time but my grandma never did She always watched it with me sung the songs and rehearsed the lines with me she never got tired of it Earlier this year she passed away and I wish I could see this with her but when it comes out I will go see it in honor of her with a empty seat next to me just for her

Edit I didnt mean the one with Johnny Depp I meant the original movie with Gene Wilder just forgot it was named Willy wonka and the chocolate factory instead of Charlie and the chocolate factory"
please let this be a banger bro
Never liked the original  Wont like this one either
Who is that girl again
i will watch this because Timothe Chalamet is in it 
oh cool another garbage wonka movie
So this must be the younger Wonka based off Gene Wilders portrayal Considering how the Oompa Loompas look 
Finally a movie from my Nostalgia I actually had goosebumps that from a trailer I wanted to see It might not look as good without Gene Wilder or even Johnny Depp but if mine reaction was to get chills from watching this trailer I have to see the movie I wonder how the next trailer for Wonka is going to be Warner Brothers I think he may have just hit this one out of the park with a homerun
That here we go momma hit 
Im not feeling it Some things should be left as is
id only hope this movie will bring back the wonka bars they were soooo good 
I absolutely HATE everything about thisand how DARE them make his costume look like Gene Wilders  STOP MAKING REMAKES
this is going to be perfect for the christmas season
Cool to see Jason Goldstrikers origin story
This looks like a really good movie to get really stoned to
Ik Jhonny depp is the best Willy Wonka but he is too old for the role
Make something new
I dont know what looks more fake the lighting and colors the effects or Tims acting Shame
Honestly I just cant help but think of Lies of P when I saw this trailer because they based Pinocchios appearance of Timothe Chalamet Which btw I cant wait to play that game
So considering the appearance of the Oompa Loompas this is a prequel to Gene Wilders movie
forced diversity and terrible acting ill pass
Who ever decided to cast him as wonka is a genius
im gonna be alone here for sure  But this looks so over the top cheesy and not in a good kids film kind of way  Just seems like its another kids movie with too much happening and not enough time to absorb it or care  It just looks awful and the trailer pretty much showed the entire plot  Usually they do that when the movie has no substance  Crazy
"Oh good ANOTHER movie remake 

Hollywood is a bunch of hacks trying to change culture by modernizing classic movies so people wont watch the old ones because the old ones would judge their current actions"
Love love Wilder as Wonka so another remake felt unnecessary but seeing this is a prequel  Im down
This feels very magical and whimsical I love it already
Are you telling me that Willy Wonka is from the same universe as Harry Potter and Newt Scamander
Great Chance to see a great inspiring creative movie
Havent been excited to see ANY film since the pandemic this one is making me tingle
I wonder if Willys father or even Charlie will make an appearance
I love you timothee chalamet Every thing he touches turns to gold Cant wait
Whack
"the fact thet its gonna be released in winter makes it more perfect and dont forget that therell be rowan atkinson in the cast list omg
"
Monka
Is this really a new movie about Willy Wonka and not about magic
Surprised they didnt cast a chocolate man to run the chocolate factory
IM SO STOKED FOR THISSS
"Not quite sold on it  It just feels like a reskinned Greatest Showman based on this trailer
Then theres the fact that this is a prequel and we know itll end with someone betraying him followed by the store closing the factory gates being shuttered and Willy becoming a reclusive shut in"
How Willy became Wankah 
this looks amazing
Oh brother how many times are they going to remake the same movie or beat down this topic like a dead horse
Oliver Oliver Oliver Willy Willy Willy
This looks horriblebut I bet it be good Judging from all the bad movies that looked like they were going to be good
I miss the Johnny Depp version
I hate modern day vibe jokes  and dialogue in antiquity vibe movies also this seems like the grindlewald movie
The chocolate must flow
Chocolate cartel seriously
Rowan Atkinson stole that trailer
Seeing the orange Oompa Loompa means that this Wonka prequel takes place before the Gene Wilder version because the Tim Burton version made the Oompa Loompas have natural skin colour
timothee chalamet is hot but hes no gene wilder thats for damn sure imo these gen z kids will never be the comedians we used to have because theyre just too tainted by internet culture
We dont need this
These comments bouta be from 5 years ago
This looks awesome
"Through the entire trailer what horror have they created I wont watch it
Hugh Grant oompa loompa damn it I have to watch it"
Little does Willy know that in a few years his shop is gonna belong to a boy named Charlie Bucket
poor delivery just stay with brooding roles man
se
When I saw the guys eat the flying chocolate I was like The only way to get down is to burp
"the 1960s Wonka a will NEVER be outdone haha
these lazy remakes with modern charm will forever be monotonous"
Why does this actor look and sound like Daniel Thrasher
looked like a pass until the Hugh Grant bit might watch this just for that
Sweet another prequel to Snow Piercer
I didnt care til I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompah
i love itt its very whimsical
ITS TIMMY TIM YEAH
"W imsical
O
N derfull
K ayotic
A mazing

How i describe this trailer and hopefully the movie "
Being 57 years old I will confess that as I began watching this trailer I was thinking buthe isnt Gene Wilder By the time I got to the end of the clip I was hooked I get it now A fresh new look at a classic I am now looking forward to seeing this
Its like hes a blend of the two previous versions with his own unique flavor Gene Wilders whimsy with a bit of Johnny Depps wackiness
What I was hoping Fantastic Beasts was going to be like
Carson from Downton is also here
Ew musical Goodbye
"My expectations are low but I hope Im pleasantly surprised

Hugh Grant might save this single handedly though"
This is what I call a movie
"Willy Wonka 
I would like to learn and know the story of Willy Wonka"
Good lord make it stop
Wait is that Johnny English
Im glad to see Timmy getting out of his comfort zone with this role however he seems a bit too young for this character
I was just saying wheres the Oompa Loompasand then Hugh Grant
Oh wow another remake  How oh how I wish something original came out
TIMMYYYY 
you can never beat the original Charlie and the chocolate factory Gene Wilder as Wonka was the best Johnny Depp as Wonka was awful why are they making a 3rd Wonka at least this one looks better than Johnny Depps Wonka will i go to pay money to see this new Wonka maybe
We definitely need this This will be worth the waiting Take your time Warner Bros Make this movie as best as posssible
"Awesome Trailer
I figure with the cost of the popcorn goobers and a medium sized coke I just saved 2250"
Yes omgggg so excited to watch
Im shocked They didnt turn Willy Wonka into a female latin character
As a diehard Dahl purist this should feel like blasphemy but I kinda want to see it
You know its gonna be bad since Keegan Michael Key is in it
ANOTHER wonka movie righto
Awesome
This looks rough and just devoid of magic
Ive always LVED Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka  My favorite nostalgic movie next to The Wizard of OZ Looking forward to this
This looks so good Im only a little puzzled as to why this Willy Wonka has an American accent Isnt the story based on England Even the Oompa Loompa Hugh Grant speaks with a British accent
The theme
nope scratch that reverse it
114 incredibly in character for Keegan 
The Oompa Loompas yooo hahahah
Ohh boyy this film is gonna make Christmas the best day ever by filling the atmosphere with some great epic adventure as we see Willys journey on becoming a huge chocolate maker out there
Wow this looks awful
This is going to be good Im really excited for it
No
The Chocolate Cartel 
Imagine if Wonka 2 comes out in 20242025 where Charlie Augustus Violet Veruca and Mike appears in the second
Idk y but hearing theres a chocolate cartel made me laugh
Why do we need another Wonka movie
Looks kinda bad to me tbh and I feel like Timothy Chalamet is in everything atm
What a mess What happened to Johnny depp
Hope this one will be good I still absolutely LOVE the original from 71 and sometimes still find myself singing oompa loompa loombadidoom x
"208 Weighing 248 lbsTAZ

ITS TAZ"
Looks awful
it shouda been Johnny Deep
Too bad the story is sumed up in the trailer They did it again 
Am I the only one who thought nobody but myself would care for this movie
No thank you
Timothee chalamet
Black people in Victorian England No thanks Utter BS We were NOT free then Stop twisting history
Candy is dandy  but liquor is quicker  nice try but Gene Wilder IS the only Wonka
This looks awful
Im watching for Olivia Coleman
They made Wonka Super BRITISH
Why is there black people
This looks fun
thats keaty from the beach
Fock this
What a absolutely wonderful Im sure it actors Rowan Atkinson an priest in wonka so excited to see wonka movie
NOOO
Theres a disconnect not that i dont like him but its a miscast for me
""
qu ganas de comer chocolate estoy re manija aguante la droga
045 bro that literally looks exactly like daniel thrasher Am i going insane Daniel thrasher the funny piano guy
Mr Beast already did this but okay
Im not buying it If it reviews well after a few weeks maybe But after 10 or so years of getting tricked by Hollywood its time to stop getting falling for trailers p
Cant wait for this looks fun
Its about time some one did thisI hope they get it right
Yo Mr beast got that budget man 
Is that daniel thrasher the funny piano guy
This is before he got his willy
How can we ruin another great childhood movie
the only thing I care about is how much added sugar it has in its nutritional value
Mr bean in it
"A film about a way lively Willy Wonka with optimism and humanity BEFORE he became the recluse and cautious candy maker we grew up knowing

Im sold"
This looks so good I cant wait 
really not a fan of hugh grant as an oompa loompa and always hated the original oompa loompa design so the only movie ive been looking forward to for a year is already disappointing me 
Willy Wkagreat
You see Im something of a magician myself
It just doesnt have the charm of the first one
looks terrible lol
muito bom mas infelizmente no  o johnny depp ai fica dificil
Everyone picking out the smallest detail to justify watching this absolute disappointment
They horribly miscast Wonka in this sadly Great actor but completely wrong for the role and this performance just looks so wrong
So this is before he goes evil and starts killing kids
This looks terrible 
This actually looks really fun I like it
Hmmm more remakes
I think Ive never been less excited for a movie in my life after seeing a trailer
My childhood  willy wonka 
Christmas cant come soon enough
"Whats bizarre to me about these kinds of diversity pushes in film is that Identitarians are constantly harping about making movies for modern audiences yet the black representation in this trailer doesnt come anywhere close to matching the demographics of modern day Britain

Black British citizens with African andor AfricanCaribbean ancestry are the largest ethnic minority population at three percent of the total population

And yet a clueless viewer watching this movie in vacuum might come away with the impression that black people in Britain range anywhere from 40 to 50 of the population That is a RIDICULOUS overrepresentation The only name I can really give to the phenomenon is black fetishism And seemingly only black fetishism because the director apparently doesnt give a damn about Asians or Middle Easterners or Indians or any other ethnic group"
This looks exciting
lets go timmy t
""
THE BACKGROUND MUSIC  When I heard the melody of pure imagination I GOT CHILLLLSSS This is gonna be a good one
Yeah it feels like a Paddington movie just not in the good way Sure this movies gonna do fine with toddlers but the chocolate factory we all know is a classic for everybody Wonka is trying so hard on a level of cringe that screams desperation Why is everyone so fruity and musically entwined Why does every piece of dialogue include a pun
Trash
Wonka movie can not wait on Disney plus
""
Anyone noticed key and Peele
Every top comment youre seeing is the most obvious use of botsAI Ive ever witnessed on the internet
NO
031 UM MATTHEW BAYNTON
Wonka Im something of a Magician myself
Ridiculous and unnecessary
Hollywoke are creatively bankrupt
okay i was really skeptical of timothee playing willy wonka buti think he really did his homework
Was that Rowan Atkinson 
Tim whoever as Wonka might be the worst casting decision of all time
This looks awful im not going to lie
Looks like 
I dont like it maybe I gotta watch again 
This looks nowhere near sinister enough
"I Love this new Version of this movie 
Its going to be So
Great"
No one will ever be as good as Gene Wilder playing Willy Wonka Ill pass on this
I dont know if its just me but Timothe Chalamet is the only one I feel icky about which is weird because hes the main role I dont get that energy and bipolarism the two other adaptions of Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory had I dont know if its just me or if its too soon to even judge but I just wanted to share my thoughts
Im being very honest this film is going to tank at the box office It just seems quite a pointless movie going in a pointless direction Just like one character says nothing to see here Its not saying anything new on the previous incarnations I can see this will most definitely flop
Hopefully we dont see any dead kids in this movie Other than that I hope this adaptation lives up the hype
They literally couldnt have cast Wonka betterand OH MY GOD from the producer of Paddington and Harry Potter Its gonna be a masterpiece
this looks pretty cringe
Cant wait
Why do they have the floating candies when this is supposed to be a prequel Maybe Im just dumb but gramps who worked for Wonka for decades seemed really surprised when they floated in the original
I had to watch this twice coz all i spent most of this trailer just wondering if i saw Olivia Colman then i saw the list of names and i was right
Them basing this after Gene Wilders willy wonka God my heart
I love that they kept the original Oompa Loompa look and Hugh Grant in the role might actually be genius 
sequel or prequel
once we start dancing we can not stop
Ofcourse they were going to add a black female character with willy that will get half of the screen time Ofcourse
I hope they visit Loompa Land and show the WangDoodles Ive always wanted to see it
nee
Stop making movies that have been made already Be original make your ideas
Hes no Gene Wilder but Im going to give it the BOTD for the love of Wonka
this performance would make more sense if timothee was in a fedora 
Watched it again Its growing on me
Wilder Depp Some random clown Once again hollywood proving they have nothing new to offer
but wait didnt willy wonka discover oompa loompas on an island searching for new tastes
i already dont like this bro does not look like a willy wonka
Why
Is this woke like all the other new movies coming out
So stoked about these historical biopic movies coming back First Oppenheimer then Napoleon now Wonka Cant wait 
So is there anything left of the movie to see
""
No thanks Ill stick with Gene Wilder
This is gonna bomb
the main probem i see here is that they are trying to present wonka as a nice caring person the character that we all known and fell in love with is NOT a good person  thats what makes him so interesting hes a cold person that very rarely shows any sort of emotions a bit disappointed that they are presenting the character in a new  and not so intersting and unique  way
The chocolate must flow
Boringgg
Willy Wonka is not a good person lmao
this is morally and intellectually bankrupt
Miss Johny depp acting on this that was a time
Xd
I will
This little girl side character seems unnecessary considering we never see or hear of her in the original
arent  that Mrbean as the running priest 
Somehow I forgot what I was watching when this ad appeared and then 053  so I definitely need to watch this
Rowan Atkinson as the Priest with his Mr Bean voice makes everything better
HUGH GRANT AND ROWAN ATKINSON WILL CARRY THIS MOVIE BRUH 
thisll be a great holiday film
No one is talking about how he embodied Wonkas attitude and made it his own He made it a Wonka but a younger and dreamer version and I am here for it  I legit thought that the thumbnail was Johnny 
was that mr bean
"This looks so cool and amazing I bet Timothe Chalamet would do perfect as Willy Wonka just like how Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp did to their roles 

And I cant believe that both the director for Paddington and the producer for Harry Potter and Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa too Now that just makes it even more perfect This just feels like a tale here Both the book and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory were my whole childhood and props to Warner Bros for bringing back the classic book character o  o"
This actually looks brilliant and am I the only person who started welling up when he speaks to his mother 
Ummmmsorry Timothy blind simpsbut Timothy isnt timothing like he usually timothees
The truth is the only reason I look forward to this movie is because they can go through all of the eras and forget Gene and Johnny and finally get us on the great glass elevator
Omg really another remake wow what a orginal idea bravo   
Doesnt look appealing
Yes people We now live in an age of remakes
"From the director of Paddington
Thats already enough to convince me that this movie has every potential to be great"
Aside from 50 of England apparently being black back then this looks like garbage because its Wonka removed from his factorythe factory You know the most interesting part about the Wonka universe
Might give it a try The time period looks a little off to me but my first experience was the Gene Wilder version which took place in the 70s which would have put him starting out just after WW2 This looks Victorian
Johnny deep is 
Why Why another one already Wtf
On my birthday  amazing 
Maybe everyone gets to a certain age when you start to see your favorite movies as a kid get remade twice by now Unfortunately Im there and its no fun
Here we go momma made me cry  thats not fair I cant wait to see it on Amazon
I wonder if Willy will get his chocolate store in the end 
Looks stupid
Im literally here from tiktok and ims that Timothy chammelt
this looks bad
Timothe Chalamet is a good actor but as Willy Wonka appears flat and not enthusiastic or expressive enough he doesnt show his trademark deadpan stare
This will be a perfect Christmas movie
From the trailer it looks completely devoid of soul and character I sincerely hope Im wrong cause this is actually a good idea for a film 
Rowan Atkinson won me over definitely gonna have to watch this one
Nobody needs this movie lol
No one will beat Johnny depp hes just a legend
Finally the prequel everyone needed
Iam pretty simple man I see Chalamet I click it
Looks very promising Im sold
WHY RUIN SOMETHING SO BEAUTIFUL 
NOOOO WHYYYY 
how many remake they gonna do ppl ran out of ideads
Wow this looks terrible theyre not even trying anymore are they
Looks boring
I wish Youtube still let you see the dislikes
Having Rowan Atkinson alone makes this movie worth watching
But why
wait I am actually really liking this
Musical boooo
no one can beat gene wilder or johnny depp as wonka ngl
This looks dumb af
If he wasnt hot you guys would see he is a great actor but not for this role The delivery on the opening lines in the trailer lol
how tf did u make willy wonka into a marvel movie lmfao
Was that gringots
NO NOT ANOTHER
""
129 look at the guy in the yellow suit
Oh my goodness you can just feel that there is heart in this movie Feels like i went back in time when that was what movies were made from I am absolutely looking forward to this
If they show us how or why he becomes jaded and closes his doors at the end Im sold
Hes not a good Willy Wonka Whoever did the casting needs fired
why didnt they ask johnny depp to do this instead he played the character before
Never seen the worlds fascination in Wonka
Looks horrible lol idk what you guys are smoking Another poorly done modern remake devoid of soul and emotion
His chipper attitude is getting me thinking something earth shattering for him is going to happen
Welcome to modern Hollywood where any given franchise will at some point get an origin story movie
Hopefully after this we get another Charlie and the chocolate factory with  this cast
No
I dont want to be older than the guy playing Willy Wonka
Lame The corniness seems worse that depps version
Nah this movie its too childish for me Tim not even look like a man hes just so young thats all I have to say Its look Disney movie Others wonkas movies was for everyone but this is only for kids
I really thought Daniel Thrasher was playing Wonka for like this entire trailer
119  A Great emotional rendition of Pure Imagination The song which connected us to our childhood and Mr Willy Wonka himself
Seems like an amazing cast an explosion of fantasy except for the lead character NO American spoke like that at that time if they looked like him  Everyone else is ear candy to listen to except the American kid with poor elocution at the centre of this And his lines appear to be just as cringeworthy with its cheap English shaving off every consonant Seriously could NO ONE have spared a few extra  to hire a proper vocal coach
I hate how absolutely terrible this looks when will they learn packing a movie full of celebrities doesnt make it good 
That is the most boring portayal of Willy Wonka Ive ever seen  Hes making the whole thing look like one of my 11yr old nephews school plays
The fact that Johnny deep isnt playing Willy wonka upsets me he is the best in my opinion 
But wonka is johnny deep
this is aboutta be the most mid movie of the year
Wow looks like dreadfulgarbage
Oh my god
The prequel to the remake of the original
Chocolate cartel
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHH In my teenaged girl voice
Looks horrible TC is so annoying
There is ony ONE Williy Wonka and that was Gene Wilder  However i think he would be pleased to see Timothee Chalamet play a younger version of him  Remember there is nothing that he knows to compare with pure imagination
Timothee
Yeah  No
Nah bro
Im really so excited 
is that a joke legendary Rowan Atkinson has less than a second screen time in the trailer
I got to see an early screening and let me tell you my favorite part was when he said its Oompa time And then he loompad all over the place
Black people No thanks
018 yeah Im not doing this Movies are so unoriginal
I am so glad theres a Willy Wonka without Johnny Depp
Omg have to see it But too long of a wait
iM mAKIn cHOcOlaTe of CoURse
Way to ruin such a great childhood movie 
A messiah cannibal and a chocolatair Ive always suspected Wonka of being a bit off
Oh look more woke garbage
why am i lowkey hyped
  
Chalamet as vonka is as good as Jhonny depp
Early Harry Potter vibes looks great for Christmas
Yeah no one asked for this
another woke remake
Great casting
This looks like a sweet love letter to the 1971 film and I love it
"Chalamet is awful here everything hes delivering seems awkward and wooden 

Hugh Grant will still get me in a seat Lol"
Willie WOKEAh
this is gonna be a good feel good Christmas movie
this looks so bad
How many times do you need to thrash this Come on
His vocal performance is so flat Just sooooo flat
Im so excited I just know its going to be good Also I just love Timothy Chalamet
Keyyyy from key and peele Definitely watching this
Why this looks like a cheap CGI B movie from Netflix France
Johnny Depp is better
Looks like he was forced to do this
johnny whyyyyyyy
Thats a Ravenclaw
The pure imagination music in the background so much nostalgia and chills
Nope More diversity and representation and you can stick it where the sun dont shine
Timothys acting is kinda rough based on this trailer
No thankswheres charlie
this is some bad acting
closest thing were getting to him actually being connected to Harry Potter
nah
Wokea What a load of C
Looking forward to it but miss Johnny Depp 
this guy is becoming a world class actor no ways
""
Noooo no one can beat Johnny depp as wonka  Im sorry timmy
Omgthese remakesno way this will touch og wilder
Nah
Hes a little too sane for me
I am NOT that guy but sometimes you should cast a little person What the heck Oh well
  Willy WOKE   
Hey me again Hollywood aka Pedo Central how many kids you exploit today and how many have you taken
Can already tell this is going to be a banger
OMG Mr Bean 
Looks awful Next
The cast is again diverse except for the two shots of the bad guys in this story They were all white
Why do I feel like this is allegory for coke
seems like hes trying to hard to act like johnny depps wonka just younger
"Even though it kinda pisses me off that there has to be a third remake of Willy wonka the director is incredible cast is awesome and I shall be watching it

Although Johnny depps Willy wonka will always be the greatest"
All this payed bots are so cringe And seeing the actor who plays willi wonka already made me threw up zero charisma zero acting skills why didnt they just let johnny play this make him younger with cgi since he already played the younger willi wonka
OMG  this looks WONKALICIOUS 
Shouldve had Tim burton direct this 
cant wait for this horror movie
"Mr Bean

leonardo pointing at tv meme"
Hugh grant hugh grant hughie grant hugh la la la
Who up wonking on they willy
baaahahaha another useless remake I love America I love white people lol
Is better that Johnny Depp in the 2005 film of the same name
This looks soo bad
Why didnt they cast Jim Carrey as the Oompa Dangit
This brought tears to my eyes  I was just singing the Willy Wonka song the other night 
Its not Johny Depp
I love this movie already
Nah this guy cannot replace Johnny deep as Willie Wonka 
Except Willy Wonka was a villain Lol He wasnt the good guy
Who is that little girl and why is she not in any other wonka movie
Chocolate must flow
I cant wait to see this and it comes out on my birthday 
This has to be one of the worst castings in the last 5 years
WB been making a hof lineup of movies recently
This actually looks promising 
Im wondering this time how many children will be ground in with the recipe how many will be obliterated by fans how many will explode and so on Whats Wonkas torture andor kill count now
AHHH
Wilbur  Let me check your teeth Willy
I see its the life autography of willy the wonka god of chocolate
Wrong Wonka should be English
WONKA or WOKA 
Ive always wanted an origin film of the 1971 movie Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory
Those first few lines from timothee really did not sound natural Im sorry I think hes great at serious roles but I felt like he was doing an impression throughout this rather than his own interpretation
I was rolling my eyes until Hugh Grant started dancing Ticket sold
Bring back Henry Cavill
Great Hollywood ruins another movie
People call me a wonka 
Isnt that the same mom 151 from Johnny Depps version 
bad acting detected    what a shame
Ah this is going be GREAT in the box office
Idklooks awful
Oh God why cant they just leave this Movie alone   If you are going to keep changing it then at least stick a little more closely to the Book   This Actor is trying to copy Depps version not good   The one with Gene Wilder still the Best  Every time they remake a Movie now it gets worse
wheres the children that became blueberries
Timothy ChamaLamaDingDong aint never gonna fill Wilders shoes NEVER And yes I couldve cast this role much better
its gonna be a big maybe for me really excited about the direction and production team
No because the only reason Im going to watch this is because Timothe Chalamet is in it
Doesnt anyone have an original idea The first Willy Wonka was brilliant The Depp version missed the mark Now this WB blew it with the super heroes and this reeks of desperation Such a waste of truly talented actors
Is he a young Gene Wilder wonka or Johnny Depp wonka 
I am so excited to watch this in theaters
Well it doesnt exactly look charming or weird which is what made the original so good And I dont think TC feels right at all for Wonka But I do love Paddington so Ill give it a chance I guess
to see mr bean in an elevator and made by paddington im watching this
That timothy is not a professional actor  Cuz his mom is jewish now we see him everywhere  Sorry i have nothing against jew people i have already jewish friends  So plz stop making untalented people as amazing actors 
Big chocolate HATES him
Im glad Gene is gone This should be a crime
The Oompa Loompa scene is what made this trailer I now care about this film
Mark my words this will go viral  157
I cant believe it theres a movie at the dropping trailers stage that sounds like I DO want to see it I think that last time that happened was Bumblebee
The cast is fire
Only a day  its at 11 million views
Oh i would love to watch this  138
""
Have I gotten old this looks dumb
Nope
Johnnys performance will be hard to top Lets see how this one goes
This looks Fun and daydreamy a good escape from reality which we all need cant wait to see this at Christmas
te quiero mucho Timothe Chalamet
This looks way better than the last Charlie and the chocolate factory movie
A third Willy Wonka Really Probably too woke
Wow I love it
Timothee is a great actor and i loved dune and the king but I am for some reason not vibing with this role of his could be just me it looked too superficial for my taste idk
Here we go mama give me chills 
"So how hard is this one going to flop

Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is hilarious I must admit"
Of course they would put a black girl in that role even though no one except a black man would ever date one
What do you mean willy wonka isnt a YouTuber called mr beast
"This just seems a bit too cheery 
Willy Wonka as far as how he is portrayed in the novel and original movie is a bit of a dark fellow  Which is why Gene Wilder was cast in the original film As one of the producers said in regards to Wilder
He had the sardonic demonic edge that we were looking for

We also know by the time Charlie and the Chocolate Factory takes place Wonka is a recluse that has shut himself away in his factory after firing his entire staff except for the Oompa Loompas 
So how do we go from this way too optimistic Wonka to the one that is met by Charlie"
Way to go WB wrecked another classic movie
why do i want johnyy to play this role
This movie looks good
Soooooo how many wonka is this now 4 ffs lets see how woke this is
"Alright guess Ill be the one to say it




Timothee feels and looks miscast"
Hopefully better than the previous rubbish movie of Wonka and his chocolate factory many years ago
"Looks like a good movie for me
I grew up with the Roald Dahl books during my childhood and have read all the books with exitement
The Charlie and the Chocolate Factory book is one of my favourite books and it has given me thoughts on how it had been if the chocolates in the books was real stuff
Now that the two movies from 1971 and 2005 with Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp has given their magic out we get the story of how Willy Wonka became the chocolate maker every fan has read about
I bet there still a fan or more who wants to get exited to see this one as a christmas present before the holidays
I will for sure grab some sweets and see it for myself"
The cgi looks badthe first sonic trailer level bad
""
Im so happy that this is coming back 
Is this still the same universe as Snowpiercer
This looks so bad lmfao
It looks bad
Hopefully it will cover the harrowing experience that turned him into a human being hating narcissistic
Im sick of looking at black people
JOHNSON
THIS LOOKS AMAZING
This looks so boring
A 3rd Wonka movie awesome
Olivia Colman Shes superb
Every good thing in this world started with a dream so now Im dreaming of a chocolate bar 
IF YOU LIKE WONKA HIT THAT LIKE BUTTON
And here we go A fan service that captures a wellknown character to create an idol effect with diluted elements of great franchises in this case Alice in Wonderland  Mary Poppins  and an aesthetic and lazy recycling of Fantastic Beasts  with a repeated plot bland full of special effects characters without charisma or personality and cliches Nothing new here The trailer ends with the exact last scene being an easter egg and considerably gross They really no longer try to camouflage the play of attracting an audience by memory and not by quality And it really works
I wanna watch this movie NOW Did Road Dahl write a prequel book to the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Trilogy There were two books I remember Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and its sequel Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator I dont remember there ever being a prequel to this
MrBeast Wonka video about to go even more bonkers
""
Oh dear  Yet another beloved character to ruin
No 
2005
"So since Roald Dahl died in 1900 I guess the copyright is free now

Good

Sadly you folks have decided to make Wonka into an approachable 20something rather than the reclusive creepy and somewhat menacing figure weve come to know  Now Im not gonna whine about Hollywood raping the corpses of deadIP though you are  And Im not gonna whine about you folks substituting CGI for plotsubstance though Im pretty sure that applies here too  What I am gonna whine about is the absolute lack of testicularfortitude here  You could have taken Wonka and explored his darkest aspects made a thoughtprovoking piece that leaves viewers questioning the nature of humanityinstead you made a bunch of CGIfueled dancenumbers with a manchild who looks like he just recently discovered thriftshopping 

Im sure youll make a lot of money from disappointed adults and children who dont know any better  But nonsense like this is why film is dying  Its not piracy   Its not COVIDits your lack of ingenuity its your lack of vision"
Wonka had always been an eery character Always a step over the line A little mysterious This version just looks like a silly whimsical kid I cant see a boy like the one in the trailer turning into the sort of scary awkward adult that is Wonka Makes me apprehensive of this movie but maybe the trailer just didnt capture the characters persona all the way Idk how I feel about it
I think I heard them announcing this movie a while back and I was actually annoyed by it but seeing this trailer makes me really excited about it
Charlie and lady dark chocolate
This looks so good Cant wait
Its a bit much
Movie looks terrible Tom Holland couldve played this role better
The hype I vot for Henry the V on netflix has the same level of hype for this Fkn get in Timmy boy
The actor Im most excited about in this whole damn cast is Mathew Baynton 
Is this the prequel
Whos wonking there willys now
i absolutely CANNOT wait
ive been anticipating the day this trailer would be released sind this movie was first announced by the looks of it the long wait definitely didnt disappoint i cant wait to see this in theaters and perfectly timed during the holidays after dune part 2 
Honestly this looks dumb
I hate this wonk Bring back Johnny depp 
I always love when a good movie comes out around Christmas and this really looks great Timothee Chalamet along with an all star castcant wait to see it
"YALL GOT ROWAN ATKINSON IN A WILLY WONKA MOVIE
I AM SOLD"
To see Timothee Chalamet sound so goofy and quirky makes me laugh I mean in Dune and other things I see him he seems so serious and reserved This is whole different view of him and I like it It looks so cute with the music playing in the background and seeing all the colors musical numbers Perfect Christmas movie
Who knew HG as an Oompa Loompa was exactly what we needed 
This looks absolutely awful
I wish one was made based on the 2010 Willy Wonka with Johnny Depp That way it tell more about his childhood We know his father but not his mother
I really felt when willy said its wonkin time
This is the British crossover we never knew we needed Weve got Mathew from Horrible Histories Rowan Atkinson from Mr Bean Johnny English and Hugh Grant from Paddington
Looks amazingbrilliantand Im 60
I almost rolled my eyes at yet another movie that will be riding brand recognition all the way to profit but it actually looks delightful and that it will be a happy edition to the Wonka lore
Thank you for giving me a reason to was the new flash movie
I cant wait for this It feels like a prequel to the Gene Wilder movie I liked the Johnny Depp one too but Wilder was on another level as Wonka and it gives me vibes of Mary Poppins meets The Greatest Showman My only hangup is that Wonka said Scratch that reverse it instead of Strike that reverse it but thats a tiny nitpick This looks great
betta than johhny depp      sorry johnny
Im ready for the Willy Wonka Into the Wonkaverse Need that Johnny Depp and 2pacd Gene Wilder action
I didnt know Timothee could smile
206 Homunculus
Am I the only one that thinks this doesnt look great And I want it to be I love Timothee but from what I see here he just doesnt have the intensity or weird charisma that I associate with Wonka I hope Im wrong
Im very impressed with Timothy Chalamet he really became Wonka However Im not sold on the writing or overall look and feel of this film from this trailer We will have to see
This looks retarded  That actor is all wrong for Willy Wonka Wonka is an old man not a young 20 something  Warner bros ruining Willy Wonka Gene Wilder is rolling in his grave
Bot campaign
Okthis looks better than I thought it would
Well as someone who read the books and watched both versions of the Chocolate Factory I have mixed feelings But I like how Timothy Chalamet isnt trying to be either Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp and is putting his own spin into the character Just the right amount of whimsy though Im wondering if this film will end with him closing the factory and then alluding to his famous or infamous if youre Augustus Gloop tour and the Golden Ticket
Ever since that disturbing Call Me By Your Name movie having a teenage Chalamet being sexually seduced by a 30yearold Armie HammerI just cant get pumped about any movie that kid stars in And Im sorry but WONKA Its already been butchered by Tim Burton Looks like were going for seconds
Is thatJohnson from Peep Show
Great more garbage I wont watch
I cant wait
Yep Another remake 
""
"Just after seeing him dark dreadful and dreary in Dune and now bright bubbly and brilliant in Wonka is a huge whiplash I actually believe hes a different person in this Thats impressive nowadays Glad he wasnt typecast

I also like how theyre leaning hard into fantasy"
who wonkin they willy rn
Paul needs to lay off the spice
Pathetic
Terrible fake English accent random token black child shoehorn in for no reason this film is going to be dogshit
Willy foakin Wonkah
Looks absolutely pathetic Johnny Depp had a fun take but  it wasnt WILLY WONKA This guy watched the Tim Burton movie and was like boom Ill nail this
When they were shooting in Bath a snowy scene near the waterfall i was on a first date with a girl that i married later on  Something for us to remember
They just couldnt leave the franchise alone could they All of these woke remakeitblacks are getting stupidly out of hand
oh 16 seconds in and I can already tell where this is going
Ooh this is just wonderful Ill be looking forward to this one very much
Is this before Bruce Wayne parents are killed or after
Nobody asked for this And chamelet is so 2019 Who TF cares for this movie
AYYYY NOW CHOP
not Chalamet why
Aint it hilarious how them antiwoke folks are those that get triggered just from seeing a black person on screen Obligatory what a time to be alive
Its a little underwhelming Seems to never leave the town And the little helper girl makes no sense
Another Willy wonka movie
Im surprised timothee knows how to wear a hat ngl
Where is Jack Sparrow
Bro Wonka be looking like Daniel Thrasher 
"Rather than being creative and making new IPs youre adament about ruining classics

Way to go warner  I sincerely hope this is a flop at the box office Youll deserve every penny lost"
This just seems like another one of the many uninspired pieces of shlock Hollywood has put out over the last decade
Respect to everyone that searched for wonka trailer and decided to click the Warner Bros Pictures
I just watched the entire movie
What a terrible movie the original is so much better
"Looks made for a modern audience

Ill stick with the original thanks"
I was a little hesitant when I heard news about this movie but honestly after seeing the trailer I am now excited I love how whimsical and fun this seems but it still has a serious note as well
Oh hes American now Cool 
Why God why
JFC come up with something new for once
Diversity hire of course xD
this looks good and even tho this actor looks like a teenager I know hes probably older than me lol
I feel like I wont mind the musical numbers in Wonka
Am I the only one that thinks Timothy just isnt great Couldve casted better
Im shocked Wonka wasnt race swapped
looks boring
Its like they combined the whimsical nature of Paddington with the showmanship of The Greatest Showman looks amazing
Every new Wonka movie makes Charlie and the Chocolate Factory look better and better good on WB for keeping the classics alive
MATHEW BAYNTON
I was enjoying this until I saw that bellend Hugh Grant thats put me right off watching this 
Once we start watching we cant stop 
Here we go mama  this scene is enough to watch this movie
Its hard not to measure every Willy Wonka performance against Gene Wilders take on the character Looking forward to seeing Timothees version
Was that Marion Moseby
Ooooh definitely gonna watch this
Is this prequal
Lets be honest Gene wilder killed it so much no one will live up to Wonka
Peaceful
I never thought Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa would be the best thing Id ever seen until now
Animation looks bad but will watch only for Timothe Chalamet
IS THAT TIMOTHY CHALAMET
Waner brothers finally i live them making movies wuhuu
You changed his hairstyle
Every Big thing in the world started with a dream
Ill definitely prefer this one over the Tim Burton directed one any day
Rowan Atkinson caught my eye
"wheres Zendaya
Im confused"
Cool another wonka movie
This trailer almost made me cry
Mr bean sighting
Super down for this so long as it respects the storys future by leading toward the original plot and isnt charlie erasure by introducing characters that would be inheritors of the factory
Tim sounds too depressed to play this role
Amazing idea
of course its timothee
008013 Thats probably my favorite line in the whole thing It reminds me so much of Gene Wilder
The way he talks and move doesnt feel like Willy at all it seems forced
I know its nothing like the book but the original film is unbeatable
This new movie should be illegal
Alright
usually a bit suspicious of origin stories but this has the cast and support to be a banger as well as an actual intriguing backstory in the original
trash
The usual woke pc box ticking nonsense Shame
Yeah im sick of hollywood theres no originality
Hollywood straight outta ideas huh
lmao once we started we cant stop all in all i hope is movie is good im ready to be blown away
At least Willy Wonkas still white
I dont remember this episode of house
Im gonna cry
ew
Am I the only one who thinks this role doesnt really fit him
looks good
Oh Yeaaaaaah  
TIMOTHE CHALAMET EVERYONE I geuinely believe they did a great job with the casting considering his versatility in acting and from the judgement of his silly quirky expressions that portrays Willy Wonka at its best by just this one trailer not every famous young actors these days can play this type of character well Not to mention the director of Paddington and the producers of Harry Potter who made me gain trust in this movie and look forward to it even more  literal icons Plus timing this at Christmas is just chef kiss
this is legit anotehr great willly Wonka content
Trash
Isaiah 4711 No SATTAnniku Satanic Reversals  Kappah Arurs  Copro Corporate Kaffi Corps  Kappa Xyper  Xyy Pir  WUB  Camay   93
Why does Willy wonky look like and sound like Daniel Thrasher
Na seriously I thought that this movie was a prequel to the 2005 movie but it has nothing to do with it also it shows that the movie is located in the 1920s or 1950s This movie looks more like a prequel to the 70s movie
No
David Tennant would make a better Willy Wonka
So Willie Wonka is actually a Wizard from the world of Harry Potter makes so much more sense now
Looks stupid af
Hes a good actor but I just dont think Timothy fits into any of the big roles hes been cast for Just a little off The movies still work though
This looks terrible Terrible casting choice
"Once weve started we cant stop
That explains a lot"
Yes call me Maria chocolate yes we all want to return from the dead head pepperoni
Couldnt be much worse than the versions Johnny Depp destroyed
Musical
El umpa lumpa en cgi se va a cargar la pelicula
Just kinda hate that this look like fantastic beasts
Wow its like a worse version than the original BUT with a bunch of blacks added for no reason Super cool jewish execs at WB
This is one of the dumbest concepts of 2023 How stupid that he is a master before becoming a master seriously the entire premise of Willa Wonka and the Chocolate factory is that he was a crazy inventor  candy maker who was working on new insane magical innovation in his factory the idea he had flying  floating candy at this point is just plain lazy
You could have casted the guy from The Bear
Director of Paddington Hot damn this looks good Worried about the release date tho Some big hitters in there
Que sea la precuela de snowpierce Por favor
This looks exciting
Hm I believe in timmy but i was hoping to see a quirky british boy Something like doctor who
this movie looks amazing and Timothy fits in with Willy wonka so much
I didnt think Paul Atreides would be making chocolate after wandering into the deserts of Arrakis
"The bots have truly taken over this comment section

 Well if its from the director of paddington its gotta be a masterpiece "
Why
that just looks delightful
where is johnny depp 
Another Willy Wonka that doesnt have a British accent even tho the man is literally from England
Ugh nooooo
Come with me to a world of purrreee imagination
MATTHEW BAYNTON AND ROWAN ATKINSON THIS IS A DREAM COME TRUE
Ugh
Timothe is a genius
They even got the Numberwang contestants incredible casting
this bouta be cringe
The jokes just flat out are not landing for me
Where is the group of kids 
Oh dear
Hollywood coming up with another original idea
Why does this movie keep being remade Just do a stage play if everyone wants a turn acting and directing it Movies are more definitive
Christmas has come early Looking forward to this one 
Literally in tearsits Perfect
I love this so much kids will definitely love this too
Small chocolate
Yea not exactly sold on this kids performance on being willy wonka but since it has keegan and mr bean i will go watch it
this is gonna be absolutely terrible casting that twink as wonka is a huge mistake
Nice and woke
Who up wonkin they Willy
Isnt this film gonnaa be pg or pg13 im confused
There are no BLACK people in willy wonka Stop making everything woke
Why do we need this Why not make something new
A bad passing film will be released again The whole charm and interest of Wonka was that it was a mysterious character And here it is not clear why they made a prequel it is not clear what the film will be about Tim Burtons film showed a chocolate factory and children Is Willy Wonka a magician here Why do people fly Wonka is a chocolate engineer so wheres the chocolate Where are his sweets
Looks promising but cant help but to think its just another greatest showman rip off
Yea I dont know about this 
This is just a personal opinion but Timothee Chalamets doesnt capture the spirit of Willy Wonka and idk how to feel about Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
"Its just the mad hatter selling sweets
Oh they use the old ompalompas design "
Willie Wonka and chocolate factory
Wow this looks so nah
I already thought the movie looked fun but Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa has me convinced to go
I love how it seems as a origin story I also love how it will be out for Christmas such perfect timing 
Whats the point Tim Burton already made this  it was incredibly faithful to the source material This is just another example of a money grab factory film making
Johny depp will always be my willy wonka
Why we wonking the Willy again 
Okay this totally looks like an overcooked souffle I think maybe just stick to the Great Gene Wilderand the classic OompaLoompas
What a horrible idea Even worse than the Johnnie Depp mess
I HATE WILLY WONKA will never forgive him for what he did to that poor Bosnian village
Trash
I like Rowan Atkinson thats it
"This hurts somewhere deep inside Theyve taken willy Wonka and went full harry Potter with him

Part of the character I loved about the original was the slight darkoffedge that he brought Timothy chalemet just seems whimsical animated and surprised by everything 
Sad to see indeed"
Looks as boring and uninteresting as unseasoned chicken breast
""
Here for Timothee  Chalamet Finally getting the break he needs
why is his hat cgi
I had zero expectations before watching this Now I am excited for this movie This is a Beautiful looking Trailer
I dont think this works
No one will ever be as iconic as Wonka than the late Gene Wilder
This was Michael Jacksons role No one else could ever better portray a better Willy Wonka than he would have
The casting is amazing  How can I resist watching this
"I would find this interesting if the movie ended with someone betraying him and him becoming the recluse explaining his state in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 

That probably wont be the case though"
Hope they bring back the Wonka bars in time for the movie D
MrBeast should do a part 2
Destined for failure Gene Wilder is and forever will be the one and only 
It just looks overproduced and as if its piggybacking off the ideas of the original
Another sequel movie Probably gonna flop
I love his quirkiness as Willy Wonka Cant wait to watch the movie
So what I gathered from this trailer is that this movie has nothing to do with its source material anymore Yeah no thanks
So no crimes of criminal warfare Or child murders
and again its woke af
This is bad
 
We didnt ask for this and yea im getting bad fantastic beast vibes
So excited for this movie Our family will be enjoying it this holiday for sure 
no one replace johnny depp willy wonka
The comment section is so sterilized its cringe
Gene Wilder was whimsical in a way that felt like there was something dark behind his eyes Johnny Depp was so whimsical it was almost cartoonish and its because he was scared inside Chalamet is just a dude trying way to hard to be whimsical
I really want the Slugworth villain film to come out
Prequel to Snowpiercer
why did this trailer make me so emotional 
Mr bean was unexpected
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
An original Wonka story acting and time period look solid count me in
Why
Looks like a cozy film to watch this Christmas hope it meets all the expectations
Scratch this movie and watch Sound of Freedom
I must WATCH this movie
When I first saw this I thought it looked good but one thing made me not want to watch it I thought it would be a prequel to the remake of Willy Wonka with Johnny Depp Which isnt a bad movie Johnny Depp Carries it but I like the classic one EONS BETTER But when I saw the Orange Oompa Loompa with the Green hair and not just a short dude I knew it was a prequel to the classic So now Im DEFINITELY going to watch it
after like 17 years from 2005 he is back
Gene wilder will be spinning in his grave WOKE garbage
When is thiS coming out
When i see this teaser  remember those days with Johnny Depp 
Yeah this is definitely gonna flop I cant wait
Look another Willy Wanka movie  Hollywood is so creative NOT 
Chc mng phim thng bn 95
Not really sold on Timothee Challomett
you cant be serious bruh not again 
Before the video revealed the producer I swear I said to myself this is giving Harry Potter vibes and lo and behold 
How many times are they going to remake this horrible moviestory  Yikes another one
Ive got a bad feeling about this one
Im pretty sure half the comments here are bots Aint no way folk are that excited
Do the great glass elevator with Johnny depp
Im sorry but this looks awful
Another remake without the fun or  charm of the original why does every remake have to be so serious and dramatic so sick of this Get some original ideas
I must say this intrigued me greatly  My expectations have been whetted
Seriously you needed to remake this movie AGAIN can Hollywood seriously not come up with any new ideas that they have to keep remaking showsmovies and doing a horrible job at remaking them I should add
Wilders and Depps were great and this one just might surprise me
Old willy wonka is the better movie  Charlie fabric of chocolate 
As Willy Wonka once said the Chocolate must flow
Hope this one doesnt disappoint
The only thing that gives me pause is all of Willies human companions in this We know that in a few years he is going to be all alone isolated and apparently without friends So what happens to all these people he built his business with That makes me want to see a sequel to the original so we can see Willie reconnecting to some of those old friends as he rejoins society sort of
he is so silly
"Is Agustus gloop 
Veruca salt
Mike teeveee 
Charlie Buckaaat
Violet Baureguarde 
Cameo 
At least the oompas look scary unlike the trash we got back in 05"
Uuuuuuggggghhhhhhhhhhhh reuse remake repeat completely sucks try thinking outside the box
Ok its a visual treat already 
"Nonono
Willie Wonka not your name
Call me by your name is your name
Timothy is actor of one role like Daniel Radcliffe  Harry Potter forever
Timothy is those who in each movie looks like silly boy which was fckd old man 
Willie Wonka is only for Johnny Depp"
This could actually be quite fun Im looking forward to it I just wish that the trailer and so many others didnt give soooooo much of the storyline away Less is more sometimes
bro is not whimsical
When its coming on Netflix
weird enough this looks quite charming
No Not another timotei film
You got me at chocolate cartel
This is just perfect and the line up is great  cant wait to see it 
What is this trash
Timothee Chalamet looks like a young Gene Wilder
OK IM CRYING NOW THIS IS INSANENEVER THOUGHT TIMOTHY WOULD BE IN THIS ROLE FEELING NOSTALGIC AND EMOTIONAL
Ohoho I cannot wait for this
umpalumpa 
no one asked for a willy wonka prequel
"Im not really feeling this one Might just be the trailer not showing much of the story but it just doesnt look like a compelling story
I kinda expected more of an underdog angle with the struggle to break into this market thats dominated by these monolithic companies But it seems more like he just decides to do it and then everything subsequently just works for him"
THE CHOCOLATE CARTEL
I wanna say this looks good but that would be a lie But Paddington was good so who knows
I hope it does not become a hour long slop I have great expectations
Huh they copied MrBeast
Do people really need to bring out Disney here
Mr Bean 
I may give it a chance
Yayyayayyayay Im so happy yay 
Looks like it sucks how unfortunate for such a great movie character Oh well Im sure someone will be woke on top of everything else
Wonka YOU GET NOTHING YOU LOSE GOOD DAY SIR
Ah yes the woke version has arrived
Honestly just looks like its gonna be horrible
"031 OH MY
As a MASSIVE Horrible Histories fan I had to take a double take just make sure that was Matt Baynton
I cant wait to see this I always loved Matts acting and personality"
Please Stop No more drivel its too disheartening
This looks amazing and Hugh Grant at the end gets my vote for sure
Where is the Hispanic representation If blacks can keep complaining about it Ima keep complaining as well until we become equal or close to it
Im sorry but that guy has the personality of a slice of white bread
Omg a character from the book I was in love with from childhood portraying by an actor Im in love with now its just too perfect
Nope scratch that reverse it Is it worth it Let me work it
Naah bro You guys just ruined it Umpa lumpas dont look good we love Johnny depps willy wonka and chocolate factory
Hes a good actor I see him so much pulling off this type of character and the story seems good However theres really nothing here that screams Willy Wonka so I wish they gave it a different name and followed the the direction of originality towards which the movie seems to be going
This looks insufferable
Finally Timothe Chalamet in Kids movie 
A British actor wouldve been MUCH better Im not sold on Timothe Chalamet
This is missing the magical feeling of the orignal  The remake of the oringal was at least trying to recapture it this just is missing it completely
 omg
He looks handsome  on that Wonka Outfit
This is the cute and pretty version for kids Depp is the edgy a bit darker version which also caters for adults Will see I dont see any Wow factor And chanfing an iconic Ompa Will see the Cg ont this
""
This gives me Cats movie energy I pray to God Im wrong 
After watching the tralier I remembered the wizard of oz
Why does it look and feel exactly like Cats 2019
This looks so cool I cant wait
This movie is what Disney live action tried to be but failed
I swear they find away to destroy all the good classic flicks 
never thought id have a crush on willy winks after the last movie
Wonka Poppins
This will be better than Napoleon Mark my words
Im just not feeling this
ANOTHER REMAKE MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL ALREADY
Chalamet cant act
an unfortunate casting choice
Nah
I think its hilarious that he dated depps daughter and now is playing the younger version of the same character
This looks like the perfect Christmas movie Cant wait
Atreides Wonka No thanks
Cant touch Wilders Wonka theres no sense of magic here
Shoehorning Africans in England in an era when they were not part of English culture of that era 
From the creative minds of The Mighty Boosh If Noel Fielding isnt in it This is gonna flop and not be worth watching
I wasnt feeling this at all then Too late Ive started dancing now Once we start we cant stop
Ooff
"I am 5050 on whether I like this or not  The movie is creating an origin story for a beloved character that usually fails every time  Plus as much as I love Timothee Chalamet in many films I am not liking his performance in Wonka  He isnt bad but it feels like the absurdness he brings comes across as forced and not natural to the character

I could be wrong but at best it will be a good fun movie but not memorable  Maybe a 610"
Not to be THAT person but why is Wonka American
This film seems too perfect to be true Starry cast all perfect for their roles directed and produced by big names who created critically and financially successful films in the past few decades and a timeless story thats still held dearly by children and adults alike around the world Hopefully this hype will be welldeserved once the film comes out
Im sold
02 seconds in so far Do we really need another movie based on the childrens novel
Change every chocolate with drug and movie will still make sense
No dad as the dentist  When was he ever an orphan  my god this movie makes Zero sense is you already watched Chocolate factory Its like theyre remaking stories for the new age kids forget about who grew up watching 
Just horrible Wonka has been miscast
"Nobody 

Random customers eating Willys chocolates  God im so high rn"
I hate this
MrBean can talk 
Rowan Atkinson and Keegan Sign me up for this
Im not going to lie Im genuinely not going to lie Im not one of these but counts this trailer actually looks interesting
Johnson Alan Johnson Yes
boo this sucks
Whata new Wacky Willy Wanna watch Wonka with me wifey on a Wednesday
Looks mid
Timothy  
Boring
Violet eat gum get blueberry inflation is back
Another movie that will flop at the box office
""
Ah finally a movie that everyone was asking for
Johny deep just better and yes
Perfect casting for Wonka
That girls chocolate black i love chocolate black 
Guess Dune and Wonka mix
"For the love of God  MAKE NEW STORIES Stop reimagining old classics Your version will never be remembered like them Heres a secret you know why they became classics Because the story had never been told before They explored uncharged territory and built something entirely new 

The public knows that there is no shortage of talent nor great untold stories But your insistence on shunning both is making us lose faith Whos in charge at these studios Maybe its time for a change"
Willy Wonka is back in our childhoods
I love Timothee but I think Johnny will always hold the best Wonka I cant wait to see this though Awesome role to see him play lol
why about chocolate and candy for what is Wonka films all about
oh my god that movie looks unwatchable
"Any one else board with tinsle town right now Because they keep remaking old stories

How many times can they remake casablanca and other famous movies Ive seen about 4 remakes of movies I enjoyed growing up in the past ten yrs"
Oh The classic Oompa Loompa  that aside it looks charming I hope that they also bring back the Wonka chocolate to sell in stores those were the best
This shows how intellectually bankrupt you truly are I am so tired of reboots prequels and franchises  But I suppose it wasnt made for me was it
As long as its NOT WOKE bs Im in
Honestly I think this will destroy the ominous existence of Wonka which was kind of the whole point of his character
IS THAT SHAWN MENDARESSJ
I really hope that this is the role that timothee finally gets his name permanently attached to
This actually looks good
"Looks brill but one questions why does Wonka and some of the cast have American accents they are English characters really confusing for children and sorry I know this will offend some but myself as well  
Anyway am sure it wont matter once we get caught up in the joyful magic of the film x looking forward to it  as am a big Dahl fan xx"
Rowan Atkinson better be more than just a man that says run away  And then never to be seen again or Im gonna be heated
Now i get it this is the aliexpress version of johnny depps wonka right 
Alan Johnson monopolising the confectionery market is the final stage of Project Zeus
Looks too cutesy and watered down for my taste Huge fan of the original with Gene Wilder
First The Little Mermaid now thisWoke remakes have a history of failure Just give it up already
I AM A CHOCOLATE MAKER
OMG not again So tired of Hollywood these days May the writers strike continue until a new generation or actually talented people emerges
JOHNSON
Wow I cant believe I made it 11 seconds through this hogwash Miss me with this clown show
Nobody is going to like me for saying this and I dont care but this seems like it leaves a lot to be desired Especially since nobody can come close to Gene Wilders Wonka
just no
Cant wait
Looks interesting Definitely will need to check this movie out
Oh look ANOTHER IP from the past to be dug up by a studio so they can inject woke politics into so it updated for a modern audience and moved to be more in line with the sensibilities of the west
I guess only black people are allowed to be anachronistic minorities in movies with historical settings weird how they seem to be 25 of the population of 1900s England
Can Hollywood make original movies and stop sucking the life out of everything done already  Gene Wilder IS Willy Wonka this is hot garbage
So nostalgic Wonka and bean Just thinking if the trailer had started with Mr Bean how funny it would have been
Black people in 1900s london 
    
Make original movies please
Miscast on Timothy Doesnt fit
Aint no way im walking into a theater and saying Can I get a ticket for Wonka Thats wild
This actually looks really good I really hope it ends up being good heres to hoping at least Id give it a watch nonetheless
Jhonny Depps Wonka is gonna take some beating
This is going to be amazing 
Okay So In a Little excited 
Probably going to be the best holiday movie this year
Rotten Tomatoes score prediction 47
Why do they keep ruining great movies with these trash remakes smh gen z alway find ways to make things worst and worst smh
I remember when Timothe Chalamet was in Oxford and took over one of our libraries
Timothy chalamet is a yes for me
Who is missing Johny Deppp
"FACT All special effects displayed in this moving picture were achieved solely with the use of creatine

Now THATs the delicious treat that truly deserves a featurelength ad I mean movie"
Looks more like Willy Woke and the Chocolate factory
Whaaaaaaaaaat
No one can replace the original Willy Wonka JohnnyDepp
OMG yet another remake this industry is dead
"Another retelling of a beloved story Hopefully this one is good Love the idea of Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa but im sure someone will have something to say about how it should have been an actual midget and not a CGI Hugh Grant

Heres to hoping this is good"
Johnson
Hugh Grant being an Oompa Loompa just killed me lol If anyone didnt want to see this movie before they should see it now Hugh Grant is an Oompa Loompa is hilarious
Am I the only one not convinced by Timothees portrayal of Willy wonka
Johnny Depp did it better but a prequel is an awesome idea
I respect what theyre trying to do with this new and more fantasy approach But Gene Wilders version of Willy wonka is still my absolute favorite and preferred This is just too magical and extra and I was hoping to see a more realistic origin
"Hollywood is Dead
They are so uncreative"
If mr Wonka was this handsome all I would ever eat would be chocolates
This feels stiff
Black people Waahhhhhhh woke Wahhhhhhhh woke woke woke wo wo wo woke a woka
Not everything needs a origin story
The first part is the first part no one can beat the first part
i wish iwas like youesily amused
I cant wait 
Woke woke and Woke  This movie will also end up in trash 
from the director of paddingtonsheet were screwed
I was hesitant as a Gen Xer not wanting my original messed with at all lol but I had a huge smile on my face the entire trailer Plus its Timothee Chalamet ffs Ive not seen him mess up one roll and he seems perfect for this one
What a trailer excitingggg and perfect for Christmas
I dont think I like it
I think i was at the studio where they was filming this
Only Jhonny depp 
This would be a good movie for kids andd teenagers Personally this isnt my cup of tea
The Chocolate must flow
Looks horrible
Rowan Atkinson is here Idk even know why is he here  but i am way more hyped for Rowan Atkinson
Honestly this looks better than it should I mean its the people who made Paddington so that shouldnt be a surprise
This movie looks like it will be a catchy musical  
Ehh it just better be good grew up with johnny fell so hopefully this is just as good
"Looks so much promising
Looking forward to it"
This quite literally will be the perfect movie for Christmas
"Can someone please please PLEASE deep fake Lucas Jade Zumann instead of Chalamet
I just feel hed be even better"
I think Johnny Depp would be a good willy wonka too
i want him to call me mama
 
I never expected them to make a prequel of the prequel to Snowpiercer
"Nothing to see here just a group of people defying gravity 

The meme potential "
Absolutely  great quotesuniverse
"I was REALLY suspicious about this film when the news dropped like a year ago and was thinking  oh God this is gonna be a disaster Because I thought it was going to be like those live action Disney movies But Paddington and Paddington  2 are masterpieces And one of my favorite movies of all time
It also has the Harry Potter producer too Which you cant go wrong with

Im definitely pretty hype for this movie Im a huge fan of the original Gene Wilder movie And I think that they capture some of that essence in the trailer 
We need wholesome movies like this Its about time  
It would be awesome if we could go back to making FUN whimsical and magical movies that were around in the 90s and 80s like Matilda the page master or something 
Anyways Im so hyped for this"
So is he still a serial killer
thanks for ruining a classic
"This will be an entrance to a World of Pure Imagination
Its best to hold your breath make a wish and count to three"
Why is there a little girl in thisI thought Wonka was a loner outcast just focused on his chocolate
Why is every company leeching off their own movie 
Im miss johny depp
Wow I cant wait for it
This looks like an AI trailer lol
I really hope this version will finally address the unfair wages cacao producers have had to suffer for centuries
Woke remake
This is definitely not Willy Wonka but its interesting
Unnecessary but I cant deny it looks funny and charming Im going to give it a chance
As a recent father this will be amazing to watch with my kid P
Love This 
With so many great stories that have never been brought to the screenwhy are we doing this AGAIN
Loved the Tim Burton Charlie and The Chocolate Factory movie with Johnny Depp this new Wonka movie looks to capture that same magic excited 
Fun fact Willy Wonka is the devil
This is going to be a classy classic Love that it seems to be an origin story
Im something of magician myself
This looks so bad
No hate to this revamped Willy Wonka but It just still feels weird to see Willy Wonka but not the face of Johnny Depps as he just made it Hitsorically Iconic
seeing the trailer I think Warner has something created which will will be good for the box office
Tim has the look and visually its hits the nail on the head BUT can Tim pull it off  ehhhhhhhhhh  Depp did a great job imo  and No one has topped Gene Wilder   soo time will tell
My entire childhood in one video
What are there Pronouns
Warner bros never  disappoint us 
Timothe Chalemet isnt selling me as a good actor from this trailer
Why does timothee sound like those dorky cringe white knights who wear fedoras and say actually
dune wonka
Omg omg omgggggg
OMG THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE AND TIMOTHY CHALEMET AS WONKA OMG HE WAS BORN FOR THAT ROLE AND ITS A MUSICAL I AM SO FREAKING STOKED
This looks like its going to have the magic of the first film combined with what the Tim Burton movie wanted to do but failed miserably to do it
Did I just seeMr Bean
The trailer felt quite wholesome then Hugh Grant came on and I burst out laughing 
Great job technicaly very strong this story
Charlie and the chocolate factory
This looks absolutely wonderful I cant wait to see it
This looks so woke and horrible
This is so bad xD
Sorry still Gene Wilder is the best by a long way
Directed by Paul King Oh thank goodness I thought it said Paul Feig for a second
Another one of these
Stay with the Original
Golden ticket fanswhere are yall 
Dire
I might actually see this one

Wonka works as a character because of the inherent mystery that surrounds the character Gene Wilder knew this and played into it with his performance Genes Wonka is somehow childlike and whimsical yet also extremely enigmatic  at times even quite sinister Understanding where Wonka came from his origin story doesnt develop his character in any meaningful or interesting way This was a massive mistake with the Tim Burton adaptation and I maintain that it is entirely the wrong decision for the direction of this script
Looks forgettable
Oh my
Ive been hyping it up with the BlueBeetleBattalion all morning and man it was so worth it
Yes Im excited for this I can tell this is going to be absolutely insane as Willy Wonka said it in the trailer himself and Im going to love it
i am now interested in checking this out
"LOL  such woke nonsense   Jolly olde England is blacker than Harlem   You leftist writers are INSANE
BOMB   Hollywood is so dead artistically   Nothing looks real anymore to draw you into the escape   
Just woke leftist propaganda"
Yeeeeesssssss
Wow amazing 
People will watch garbage Next they will make a movie about hulks half step sisters disabled uncles son and people will be amazed People are stupid
Mono Wonka
Actually Willy Wonkas dad was a dentist and Willy was forbidden to have any sweets and he gained all his magic from unforgiveness
Is he done acting dune
Not that Im complaining but essentially this is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Harry Potter Or at the very least this is the story of a candy shops origin in the wizarding world
Christmas Whyyyy
Bro I freaked out when I saw Mr Bean I am very excited
"Cant hold a candle to Gene Wilder Also he just copied Johnny Depps voice for the character Looks awfulunoriginal tbh Is this Willie Wonka or The Greatest Showman 

Only good part was the Hugh Grant oompa loompa"
Visual Effects from Framestore Oh im so ready god the killing it right now
T H E  C H O C L A T E  C A R T E L
This proves beyond a shadow of doubt THERE IS NOTHING LEFT IN HOLLYWOOD BUT CRAPPY REMAKES and REBOOTS there is no talent nor creativity anymore
"           

             "
10 million views in a day is absolutely insane
"Junk You DONT have to understand Willy Wonka Wonka is meant to mystery and your  only be understood through the eyes of a young person trying to keep hold of the wonder of youth 
This movie will flop Its worst than the Johnny Depp I have daddy issues"
Can we have new ideas please
Sorry to be a party pooper but chocolate and sugar are really bad for your health This movie looks like one big advertisement
Sheesh making over this film agin 
Yo is this Santa Claus is coming to town Cause it looks like the same story
looks a little too heartwarming where is the edge of the original character
Please stop remaking movies I need money hit me up ive got plenty of original ideas
Alright Timothee I hope you make us proud
When you reboot a movie from 2005 you know that something is screwy
"Jitterbug 
Jitterbug 
Jitterbug 
Jitterbug

This trailer should use this song "
I take it this is not a direct prequel of Tim Burtons version Although I argue that its paying homage of the classic while being its own thing
Who wonking they willys right now
Stop remaking movies Hollywood and turning movies into TV series How about originality Oh wait Youre Hollywood You can do whatever you want 
Love Thimothee Chalamet
I thought the fake views and comments on this were egregious but then I saw that the The Nun II trailer had 22M views being 6 days old
I like the old one just by looking at this
I dont like it but Ill watch it none the less
WB is on
It feels like Directed by Wes Anderson and Produced by Greta Grewig 
No one will do this role better than Johnny Depp unfortunately
this dune sequel looks like an interesting take on the story
Omg 
Daniel thrasher
bro mr bean is here
More woke trash for the pedophiles
Now that is a proper Christmas movie 
HughGrant as an OompaLoompa Seriously  SomebodyLostTheirMind
Loving the bristish casting in this
I cant wait to relive my childhood in a whole new way
He must be one heck of an actor Ive never seen a Jew get a lead role in a big budget Hollywood production
So The studio made willy wonka origin story how  he made chocolate factory
yet another WOKE shoved
I wasnt super into this when I heard about it but this actually looks really good
Is this a supposed prequel to Johnny Depps Version or Gene Wilders supreme version
I really hope this turns out good
Why are people still allowed to make movies
"First 13 seconds were such terrible acting that I couldnt go on

Im out"
So very very woke box ticking to a new level
I cant wait
he mix chocolate with dmt
What a cast amazing 
this is gonna be so bad im beyond excited
ew
Looks absolutely terrible hes not Wonka a silly mess
This wonka bar is not as sweet as JDS
       
From the producers of HARRY POTTER oh this is dream come true No demontors for us 
Wait WillyWonka is in DUNE2 and it is a musical as he rides the Giant SandWorms ThatsJustWrong
This looks amazing 
140 WAIT A MINUTE Wheres the Teddy bear
No

"Ok i see retconning already Shocked Like the fizzy 
Lift drink Something he was just in process of testing for original  Stop taking established works with established lore and adding a twisted prequel  The laziness of thinking up new untold stories "
He wasnt willy wonka but milton hersey failed miserably like 4 times and used to not even pay for advertisment because he thought the hershey wrappers were enough advertisement
BROOOOOOOOO
yay a new story of willy wonka and not  a  remake
Huh MrWonka keeps getting younger
So excited to see Mat Baynton getting the great roles he deserves
Amazing
Did he just quote Missy Elliot  Oh yeah Im gonna go see it now
I feel like they tried but I dont feel like they really made me believe this was how Gene Wilders Wonka came to be There was fantasy in Wilders film but this feels like it went to another level where they needed to not force association with Willy Wonka and just have Timothee play a random quirky candy maker in a new franchise I think Timothee has the facial acting capability to match Wilder or Depp in true character acting one day but it wasnt 100 and it really had to be in order to be Wonka Shouldve just been candy maker movie with no association to Wonka Id prefer they kept some movie continuity like the general public not experiencing or knowing about the more fantastical aspects of the chocolate factory and the experimental candies vs how they just show people floating in the middle of town What next memory altering pixie dust I know its fantasy but the Wilder film made it still feel in the realm of possibility vs  pure goofiness
Captures the spirit of Roald Dahl
yoo where johnny depp not even a cameo 
I am so excited for this
mr bean lol
lol
This is what Paul atreides does on his free time
Timothee rocked it
No
Way too many blacks for Victorian England Of course they made Charlie a black girl with an afro
Nope
Is this a sketch
This looks awful
hollywood just cant make anything original anymore
""
Another one
MRBEAST looks a bit DIFFERENT here 
Please proceed with care WB This title and the legacy of Gene Wilder require nothing short of the greatest respect and effort
Oompa Loompa caught me off guard 
Now imagine if Johnny Depp suddenly appears in the movie
I might give this a chance because its so cool that theyre giving wonka an origins story but it really doesnt look good at all The guy playing young wonka  just comes off as really annoying
Please no
"Finnaly



A movie that I can laugh and watch"
Im gonna watch this just for the umpa lumpas
Everything we never asked for 
Im a little dissapointed tbh Jhonny Depps wonka was very human this one is just another mc
Woww woww woww
So mat baynton really IS in the movie omg
ROWAN ATKINSON LETS GO
Johnson is here Johnson is here
Waiting for release
Shonky wonky would seem a better title for this bilge
Gonna be garbage guarenteed
011 They brought back scratch that reverse it
This looks absolutely breathtaking but Timothe Chalamet aint doing it as Wonka for me
Wait So this isnt going to have the people going into the factory
We dont need a willy wonka origin story I hope this movie tanks Sick of the same retreading formula in bigbudget movies
"Gene Wilder had that sparkmagic Timothe Chalamet just doesnt possess Remaking the beloved classic about Willy Wonka again seems redundant

I love Timothe but instead of being the whimsical character Willy Wonka must be Tim seems rather stiffflat People who say that Timothe is my generations Leonardo Dicaprio are beyond delusional Tim is a good actor but he is nowhere hear Leo  probably will never be"
3
This casting is NOT IT Yuck
We just did not need this
"Never be better than the original
Mr gene wilder"
Literally no new ideas this looks horribly cringe This will be a 2 hour long movie and it will bomb no one wants to watch this
Ill still watch it but theres just something about Timothees performance isnt working Specifically the goofy bits I see the acting doesnt feel natural Idk its just the trailer will see with the whole movie
I need this movie like I never thought I did before
I love the So quiet up and listen down Nope scratch that reverse it reference to Gene Wilders We have so much time and so little to do Strike that reverse it
Thanks WB With all these shittery and wokeness around Thankyou for keeping my childhood alive Thanks for The batman the flash and now this Thanks
STOP REBOOTING THIS MOVIE
The simple fact that this is directed by the guy who did the two Paddington movies is enough to get me to watch this Those films were absolute masterpieces of performances storytelling and direction
for some reason to me it feels like a walking ad like what if in the end they put some thing saying new wonka chocolate hear now and then it ends with all the credits
Garbage
I already got bored just watching the trailer
At first I was very meh hearing about a new Wonka But after seeing this trailer YES And Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is an unexpected bonus
Cant wait to watch this movie  after the writers strike comes a end that benefits the writers 
Im way MORE excited to see Rowan Atkinson here lol
What the actual Is this a parody or something   somebody Zap me back to the 70s and 80s man What a mess Who even asked for a God Damn prequel
Missing Johnny depp
You know what the real secret to Willy Wankas success Forced Slavery 
Timothy isnt genuinely whimsical enough for me He comes across a dad reading to his child and trying to depict a character
Somethings off
Aww looks like a very great spin on Wonka Ill definitely go see it
took 500 years for africans to figure out chocalate is mexican literaly told africa the church invented it  why theres no Bison on wall street
No one can compete with Johnny Depps Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  
141 Mr Bean spotted
 
Dear God why We dont need this not really want this lets all be honest Through Willy is cute
So wheres the girl in Charlie and the choclate factory
Ruined a classic
This looks cool Cant wait to watch it
Omg yes I didnt know I needed this movie in my life until I saw this trailer This Christmas is going to be amazing
Looks whimsically charming I hope it is good
cringe and woke yikes
Saying it right now Hugh Grant is stealing this one
         
""
Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka 
Love it love it just hope they dont thrash the oompas lore
Looks terrible
        
Is that mrbean 
i like you
Missing johnny 
Johnny Depp movie is the best  ever
mary poppins vibesss
Disney where is disney
he lacks TONS of charisma to play Willy IMHO
This weirdly looks pretty fun
Ada vibe harry potter nya ada vibe UP nya juga  Rowan 
W
another woke movie nthat is going to destroi this historical IP
Did anyone actually want another Willy Wonka movie
        
Mr bean was Big suprise
This Wonka certainly feels like a big improvement over Jonny Depps take on the character
Oompa loompa
Is the black girl like supposed to be his sister Or his girlfriend or what
Wow cant wait to go the cinema to watch this
Life is like a box of chocolates
Jhonny depp is a emotion No matter what 
must be a prequel to Gene Wilders Wonka Judging frm the Oompa Loompas appearance
Im disappointed that the oompa loompas are cg now I also feel like they just took roles away from little people by doing this too Its not like they cast them in different roles in the movie
"Was that Mr Bean

Edit Thank yall for the likes "
Can you just burn it before release We dont need more bad Wonka movies just stop
"Just got a glimpse of The great Jhonny Depp 

Also the point to be noted this guy took over it "
looks dumb
Just wow Timothee Chalamet as a young Willy Wonka is something I didnt know I needed I cant wait 
This looks like its going to be fun to see when it comes out
This is better than that remake from 2005
Cant wait to see this Im looking forward to it
Why does this even exist tho
""
So many shoehorns in this movie 
Not w0ke enoughA dislike for this garbage moviewhere are the asian leadsnonbinary gender confused actors in this movie WB
129 you can hear the a world of true imagination theme
No one can replace Gene Wilder  all these remakes attempting to even come close to his Willy Wonka are beyond redundant Johnny Depp did a good job and his movie was more geared towards my generation but even I can say nothing comes close to Gene
I think this a new way to look at Mr Wonka
Good
    
This looks really good Its like an origin story very different from the original This is going to be a big movie
My son Mr Bean in this yeah its lit
Rowan Atkinson 
Wow
I dont think Im alone in thinking this movie is gonna be really good or really bad And God bless Timothee Chalamet He has that mysterious handsome charm that Wilder did
                  
Definitely watching this looks good
Lets eat dem dark mint chocolates
Great trailer great concept and plot no hate but Johnny Depp was  is and will be the best Willy Wonka but I appreciate remaking these kind of movies again ad again every decade to keep the legacy and the stories alive
Oof
Seems way too happy please dont tell me this is one of those films where everybody starts dancing in almost every scene like its high school musical
they basically showed the whole movie
Bring back Pure Imagination song Flash Back I need it
This looks so good but tbh my friend played Willy Wonka in our high school musical last year and she was so good I dont think Ill ever be able to fully enjoy another Willy Wonka again 
Skeptical
tim burton  why donnchu get him here
And in the name of blatant diversity inclusion and equityWilly Wonka gets a black girlfriend  Because ya just cant have an all white or all black couple anymore  
I dont know the original one was organic real feeling The last 2 seem too fantasy
so when does he become a murderer
Looks shite
Mrbean will steal the show
This will tank
"No day dreaming
Ill be in debt if we were charged for it"
Theyre working overtime to make him look like a good guy but all this does is make me realize why hes set out to put every other candy business out of business
WHAT 
brillant trailer
This looks good  Especially for the children Keep making stuff for the children and the teens and the world will be better I promise
Ya this is awesome
152
Hard pass Thanks
This is gonna be TERRIBLE
This really does look like itll capture the essence of Pure Imagination and im quite cynical about new films so this is rare D
Omg I want to see this
Did I hear Mr Bean actually say something
FIRE
Nobody can give a better performance than Jonny Depp as Willy Wonka 
Do we will saw aoompa loompa dance  sing again
"They have to put these diversity hires in every movie now dont They   Like the little mermaid  spiderMan  take the White Man out put the little black Things in 
Its getting real sick when you have to pander to an animal They even Tried to put a black Cleopatra in and that didnt go too well for them but I do gotta say one thing They are forgetting that they were the first ones in outer space it wasnt the White Man I think his name was Chimpo the chimpanzee yeah thats right they were the first "
Johnny Depp is the best
So this is the prequel to the prequel of Snow Peircer right
Can we have a Johnny Depp cameo
No one can ever beat johnnys Willy wonka
Timothee is the best
The casting is so chocolate coloured 
here we go MAMA
God this looks terrible and pointless
What is this I didnt see any Willy Wonka in here at all
Why
Timothee
Wow 
I want to see the magic of the wonka chocolate he create
I also find it funny how one of Willy Wonkas business rivals will be played by Matt Lucas who I know best from Little Britain alongside David Walliams
Whats the point
Im so excited
Dear Warner Brothers Thank you I have not been to the theater in years had no interest no desire This film has changed all of that Allow me to express further I am a Creative Director a creator of magical things I saw your trailer last night and smiled Then shared it with my wife and we both laughed I just watched it again this afternoon and literally have tears in my eyes Happy tears the really good kind that tells me you have struck a nerve I feel this movie will be embraced by audiences by families by children that has not happened in a long time but since the first Harry Potter came out for Christmas in 2001 I will happily support and enjoy your movie Thank you for capturing the magic of filmmaking again
"Timothy Chalamet as Wonka is amazing

Paul and now Wonka thats quite the range"
"lmao they knew to hide the dislikes

terrible"
Lets just hope they dont ruin it like other movies recently made
there is something about wonka that makes me unease I just cant like him feels like bad vibes
Oh great more rehashed stuff
OMG ITS ROWAN ATKINSON
huh
Another version of this  Hollywood is truly out of ideas  Wait until this flops
""
102 ok this is awesome that Rowan Atkinson has been cast to play the reverend
Willy Wonkas life story who didnt want this
Aaah memories bring back
I never asked for this but the story looks really good
OMg
Im getting goosebumps down my back and legs This is not what I expected to happen
OMG If there is Keegan in it I MUST watch it haha a big plus is Rowan atkinson heh
Wow this is amazingI remembered Charly and the Chocolate factory like it was yesterday
We always said this was set in the Harry Potter universe and now they have the same producer yayyyy
CANT WAIT
Who up wonkin they Willy rn
Wait did Paul put some spice in his Chocolate
""
Wow does that ever look bad
Oh god another terrible TERRIBLE take on Wiley Wonka For god sake its WOKE too
Im sick all these trailers being the exact same and this movie looks dumb
Im not gonna lie THIS ACTUALLY LOOKS GOOD
what is this i dont like this no
Hahaha no 
Would this film to be dedicated in memory of the actors from earlier film adaptations  1971 Gene Wilder Jack Albertson Denise Nickerson Leonard Stone Roy Kinnear Dodo Denney Ursula Reit David Battley Aubrey Woods Gnter Meisner Diana Sowle Peter Capell  2005 David Kelly Christopher Lee Liz Smith Eileen Essell David Morris and Geoffrey Holder 
103 orange teal disease strikes again
It looks amazing He seems like Gene wilder in the original
OMGGGG
he looks 2 young to play wonka for some reason but stll looks good
C solo 1 WW
Theres a good chance thisll be really stupid but maybe itll be fun anyways
Shoutout to the African kids picking out cocoa THIS MOVIE IS FOR YOU
You mean Wonka isnt Sean Giambrone PASS
This movie seems to be in the universe of Harry Potter
DOBI DI DO
Very good job fellows throughout the 3rd sweetest patriotic longest felicitous family entertaining experience week of said surfside Summer July Congratulations 992 yoRowan Atkinsons presence in films no matter how minor the role brings immense joy to viewers His comedic timing and iconic style always leave a lasting impression Im eagerly looking forward to this film as it seems to perfectly capture the essence of the source material Its a treat to witness Rowan Atkinsons talent in action once again
In it 
oof its depps fasterwonka voice but wilders spaced performance what a terrible mix shouldve hired tim burton feels like a british tv movie OOF
Im a little worried that Willie Wonka Doesnt seem too quirky and weird but I guess we will see
The age of remakes
HAI 
No one can replace Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka
Here in the UK the BBC each Christmas gets a couple of family friendly movies this looks exactly like one of those movies they would have
Im out Timothee is in the same category as Tom Holland for me just cannot stand his face or acting
Oh look another woke remake to avoid
im already obsessed with this story of wonka paddington director harry potter producer timothee chalamet  hugh grant im seated
Might actually see this idk
Its not WonkaJohnny Depp is
Another rehash of a classic movie Nothing original out there 
This was partly filmed in Bath and I was strolling by on a Day where they where filming and part of the Town was under fake Snow it felt super surreal with all the people walking around in Costumes and the fake Snow everywhere  i cant watch this movie without saying look we where there every 5 Minutes  
So this a prequel for Johnny Depps not Gene wilders Willy wonka Correct
Ahh man 2023 Im broke defo watching this
While this looks good Johnny will be my favorite Wonka Constant remakes I see were going to Get
Damn the cast in this film is amazing
Great video
Thank god Timothy Burton didnt get this and ruin it like he did Charlie and the chocolate factory
I cant shake Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka
I was waiting for this since 2022 im so excitied
snoooooooooooooooooooooz
Wow Hollywood has really stop trying huh Everything now is just reboots and remakes of animated movies No originality
Sheesh 
      
At the beginning it sounds as if hes reading a text
Alan Johnson
Nice they really cant come up with new movies nowadays This looks like its gonna be dog water
Why am i gettin all teary eyed when i hear pure imagination in this trailer 
AND WELL WATCH
Do we really need this though
im makin chocolate o course
I saw this and I said WILLY WONKA
Childhood movie memories
Create Roblox movie please
I would have called it willy
I thought is gonna be fake but here it is
Mrs Bean in this film Im already a fan now
I want a Johnny Depp Cameo pls thx
Movies are becoming more and more unwatchable for adults
since the first movie in 1971 and 2005 including from tom and jerry 2017 celebration of willy wonka
Timothee as a chocolate maker 
"Ill be a dissenting voice  I dont think this film looks good at all its given us a bunch of tired and cliched situations and the humour seems trite  Rowan Atkinson continues his slow morph into John Cleese he hasnt been a guarantee of a laugh for decades  My wife can take the kids shes excited by the prospect of a diddy Hugh Grant  

But from what little we can see of it in the trailer it does look as if its going to be a top turn by Timothee Chalamet as Wonka charming subtle and engaged  I thought he was a fantastic Paul Atreides I predict hell do well with this"
The dude from horrible histories is in this how good
Some day I want to make a dystopian version of willy wonka where the kids get a near death gruesome experience that leads to them being traumatized and terrified for life
This movie is going to be awesome in christmas
Otra repetida con el apellido del prota como ttulo Vuelvan a tomar cido que por lo menos se inventaban algo
Maybe this is a minor thing but after seeing the Tim Burton version I was always curious about what kind of person Willys mother was and Im glad this film will be exploring that Also Timothee seems to be striking a good medium between Johnny Depp and Gene Wilders performances Im looking forward to this
No Day Dreaming   I guess we can only do that at home now  This is going to be so much fun to take my adult children to can not wait
Started with a dream that line hits hard
My inner child is screeaaaammmiiiing CHOCOLATE
Alan Johnson
Alan Johnson Paterson Joseph as Slugworth is perfect
They changed the origin story of the Oompa Lumpa
If rowan here im IN
WHY
looks pretty good
      
No Youve learned nothing
Already it looks so good that my youtube is glitching out
Dont you people ever get tired of recycling the same stuff over and over
Will take my brother to the theater so he checks this out No way hes missing out on such a masterpiece
Cant wait to see it
So glad its the Wilder universe and not the Depp one
Sure it might be based on the original Willy Wonka but I do want to see Johnny Depp
Chalamet isnt going to top Gene Wilder i dont think hell top Johnny Depp either but since its from the Paddington director ill give it a chance
Mr  bean 
This looks awful
Well thenthis actually looks pretty decent I guess its because Disney didnt get ahold of it Lmfao
Where the kurcaci to make chocolate 
It doesnt work  All of it  Computer Hugh Oompa Loompa in a jar is cringe inducing
So excited for this movie Its going to be better than the last two
Another work movie that will crash and burn
I feel like Timothy is still trying to be too cool but thats just me
Johnny depp 
Mr Bean 
Kudos 
thi sbetter not be garbage
Im sorry but Timothy chalamet is not giving wonka vibes Looks terrible
This looks like garbage Why are they trying to make a prequel to the original film The original film was awful and a bad representation of the story
A black cop in that era riiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight Still waiting for Disney or some other movie company to make a woke Tarzan A black man raised in the jungle by apes Come on movie companies I DEAR YOU
yall enjoy watching this capitalistic trash lame get some taste please stop being hyped by unoriginal hollywood slump
What I loved about the old Oompa Loompas was how friendly yet oddly terrifying they were not just because of their appearance They managed to keep that feeling which Im absolutely all for 
not the chalamet guy for wonka this is the worst
Wait so his not based on Johnny Depps Willy WONKA
This looks super awesome so far
Then he grows up to murder children
cant wait
Im not sure if making a snow piercer prequel a decade later would be a good choice but Im intrigued
did he accidentally turn his assistant into chocolate
Timothee and Wonka like peanut butter and jelly I hope
I sincerely hope it isnt a woke Wonkathat would be intolerable
Brace yourselves the Wonka bars are coming
TFW You have Rowan Atkinson using a Monty Python line 
Cant wait to see wonka said its wonking time
103 Oh father bean I have sinned
Did anyone start crying at the music at 119 
Might rock with this
Muaddib is using way too much spice in this one
Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean was something we needed in this movie
idk how i feel about this the 2 before are masterpieces and i dont think this can top that
Wow 
MrBean
Nice to see Kobna HoldbrookSmith in there
OMG TIMOTHEE SO EXCITEDDDDD
Where is jhonny depp 
Dune
142 rowan atkinson as a priest detected
sm hype for barbie n Oppenheimer were forgetting abt this
The trailer has that sort of magical feeling I got from movies as a kid
gak ada joni deep nya
Should have been a horror for its own sake
I never get tired of the original Willy Wonka I love that movie so muchIm definitely going to the movies to see this
Omg please stop remaking tired concepts The 2nd movie wasnt even good and we definitely dont need a 3rd or to waste a talented actor like Chalamets time on a filler project
Who knew Willy had a slave
Hughmpa Loompa  
"Mr Beeeeeean  
Im gonna follow you everywhere"
Flop
                 
who asked for this
Who out here Wonking they Willy
I love that they will make this connect to the 1975 one
Caraca velho q saia logo amo esse filme 
Chocolate which make u high Nice
Chalamet go away
Looks fun Very much looking forward to it But December 15th wow thats still so far away 
Pure Imagination as the main theme is wonderful
Another spinoff that NO ONE ASKED WILL FLOP
Meh
    
iconicccccccccccccc
Awesome another movie that no one asked for The problem is that Ill watch it because Im bored
WOW I NEEDED THIS MOVIE FRL
"145 

Every good thing in this world started with a dream So you hold on to yours"
why they had to remake it smh 
I dont like chocolate 
Willy Wonka Willy Wonka the amazing chocolatier the dummies singing in the background
This looks terrible It makes me think theyve literally never read the books
Sure Willy started out as a good man fighting the corrupt establishment So did Paul Atreides
Theyre remaking it  AGAIN
Timothe Chalamet did an incredible job in Dune but in parts of this trial its pretty rough Im not buying him in the character which is sad because he has the perfect look for what I envision a young Willy Wonka to be
Im sorry but Timothee doesnt sounds like Johnny Depps Wonka Should he sounds more like Johnnys Wonka if its a prequel
Seeing Mathew Baynton from Horrible Histories got me so excited Might have to watch for him
He is perfect for the role
Maybe if they picked someone else for Wonka this might work but nah this aint it feels too much like Harry Potter style
why the fck
OOOH BOY
""
I kept seeing edits if this on tiktok for a year I thought its BEEN released
Shouldnt Willy Wonka be played by a man
Aint no way
muadib making chocolate
Starring Timothee Chalamet am definitely gonna watch
Oh man ompa luma have to be the side character in the movie
Hard pass
Seems another pro flop movie is loading
      
""
I was sceptical about a new Wonka Movie but I love that this is like a prequel and not a remake and the actor seems perfect
the casting for this is so good johnnys performance was amazing so was genes timothee has big shoes to fill
Rowan AtkinsonRowan AtkinsonRowan AtkinsonRowan AtkinsonRowan Atkinson
The spice got Paul trippin
who up wonking they willy rn
Mr bean 
Nahhh pass
Why
they got Johnny English in this movie this is legendary
peter ostrum who played charlie bucket when he was a kid should watch this trailer
oompa loompa sold me
"Ive spent the last 7 years traveling and perfecting my craft You started traveling at 10 years old
Getting way more Johnny and Timothee than Gene from this"
Alan Johnson closed JLB and started a chocolate cartel  stick that up your dojo
Looks so lifeless and dull
I cant wait D
Wheres Charlie I dont know why they change everything Just Like The Little Mermaid Makes no sense whatsoever Im sure I wont be seeing it  
Boringggggg
The first one was a masterpiece  The second one had but one good quality the pink boat  I sincerely hope this one is good and doesnt bring modern politics into the movie
Yeah this aint it
Aaaaa Rowen Atkinson I am watching the movie only for him 
I grew up watching the original Willie Wonka and in my biased opinion anyone else who tries to be Willie Wonka falls way short Gene Wilder is the OG Wonka and can never be dethroned Having said that Ill more than likely watch this movie even though some parts seem a little corny to me from what I saw in the trailer but it does look interesting
Why it made me cry
RUBBISH
Looks bad
Init
Johnny depp version is much better
"Formulaic trash Not even tiny Hugh Grant can save this GIMMICKS KILL EVERTYTHING  its called jumping the shark and new movies inspired by TikTok are nothing but sharkjumping compilations there is no substance to the story just silly things to look at HUGH is a massive disappointment for being a tragic gimmick It only appeals to absolute CHOCOLADYTES GET IT BECAUSE ITS CANDY and I suppose British people feeling left out after we stole their country 
I look forward to the videos mocking WB for losing 300M on this joke Everything they do is terrible theyre only doing better than Disney because they cant afford to make as many flops"
This looks awful
No one replace Johnny depp as willy wonka
Did i just see Mr bean
Its wonkin time
Willy wonka  Johnny Depp 
Timothes voice is like chocolate to my ears
Hes not going nearly as big as he thinks he is This is FASCINATINGLY off
lol why tho johnny depp already did this not that long ago and gene wilder before that i never heard anyone saying we really need a new willy wonka movie
MR BEAN
Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant together just movies going to be a showstopper
Wow They had to rub wokeness in your face
Timothe Chalamet was the perfect choice
"A big part of the charm of Wonka in the original film was that he was enigmatic and we didnt know what was magic tricks and con 

I dont want to see snozwanglers or know if vicious kenishes are real or not"
Wowwww looks like a great prequel
This is awful Chalamet sounds so forced in his acting
Now THIS is a trailer that makes me want to watch the movie Ngl it kinda had me at made by Director of Paddington
LMFAOOO
another one
no thanks
Willy Wonka should have been played by mr beast
great trailer I love when he said Its wonkas time and chocolateized all over the place
Shouldnt wonka have braces on at this point of time Or he just took them out
Im surprised as this actually looks surprisingly good Chalmalet looks solidly cast Im in
""
its my birthday i think it would be a perfect gift for me
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
Im not sure if I love this or hate it
I got my golden ticket
Man cant wait 
Very excited for this
i cried 
Timothee 
So can we make some new original movies please
No thank you Respectfully
I want him to go full lunatic by the end 
""
This looks retarded
I liked black colour
This gonna be GOOD 
Good to see rowan antkinson back in the game
Please be good Please dont disgrace the amazing legacy of the original by sucking RIP Gene Wilder
Whats with these bots in the comments
This looks poor
Looks pretty good 
"Wow this looks so magical 
Cant wait to watch it
Brought back so many childhood memories"
This could be the best Christmas movie this year
Didnt think they would cast Daniel Thrasher Great work man keep going
Dont forget Wonka is the bad guy
I know Timothee will be amazing in this movie Im so excited 
I have a feeling Im not the intended audience for thisand thats totally fine
No one will ever be better than Gene Wilder He was a Godand gave WIlly Wonka a slightly Kinky aire I hope its not edited that would be a shame
Diversity  
"Please find YHWH Elohim and keep the commandments in Exodus 20 and Leviticus 11

Please read Exodus 20 and pray for forgiveness

2nd Corinthians 517
Therefore if anyone is in Christ the new creation has come The old has gone the new is here

37 Jesus said unto him Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind 38 This is the first and great commandment 39 And the second is like unto it Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself 40 On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets  Matthew 2237 40

Please read the book of Jonah Matthew Exodus youll have the information you need"
Knowing that it was made by the people behind Paddington and the producers of Harry Potter convinced me that this is not going to disappoint
I mean sure Make a third movie if u want but why
"Surprised they didnt cast a black actor for Willy Wonka Its pretty common for woke companies to pander by black washing white characters
And Warner Brothers is no excpection They took a character like Dr Kynes from Dune and made him a black female Like WTF"
Not what i thought but i think itll be a good origin story I like that its serious and silly at the same time
This movie is going to flop for sure
Jonny Depp would be better 
sheesh lets get it 
          
looks boring
They couldve yassified him a bit and straightened his hair but this is okay too
I wonder if yall know there are other books that can be adapted Or hey novel idea why not create something completely new and unique
I hope this is one of this movies that you look back and think that was a great movie but that preview was awful like into the spiderverse
Im going to call it trash
Cant wait to see someone deepfake Gene Wilders face into this
""
"First class cinematography and a stellar cast as to be expected 

But personally its going to take a bit of convincing for me to accept Chalamet as Willy I dont sense any inherent kook in him Willys foibles feel too contrived to me in this trailer Gene Wlders shoes are so hard to fill though of course Ask Johnny"
The best part of the movie is Mr Bean The rest not so much to see
""
I am very glad to see that this leans more towards the Gene Wilder version my childhood favorite  Looking forward to seeing it
Why must they keep making different iterations of these movies Theyre all so vanilla Is it just me
This looks promising Cant wait to see it
I like how Charlie is now BLACK NO THANKS
I just hope that this movie shows Willy Wonka having a little sociopathic energy like the books
"I started watching it for Timothee Chalamet paused because of Rowan Atkinson 
Because now I dont want a single frame to spoil my fun like what Mission Impossible 7s trailer did for me "
Johnny Deep cameo
how many remakes does this story gonna have
Give us something original please
""
MR BEAN
Why do they keep recreating movies nothing can outshine the original
Christmas is going to be willy wonky
Not a single original idea in Hollywood at the moment
Wait isnt Willy Wonka about children who were horribly maimed for their greediness Is that a Mandela effect or what
Gene wilder was the best Willy wonka
"People flying because candy and old British aristocrats response most unorthodox
Its going to be one of those films "
""
Much more interesting than I expected but very problematic We know Willy ends up very alone Which means all the people they show leave him at some point
In heart only one Willy Wonka
It is gonna flop kids will like it though
When will the movie coming out
The subtle pure imagination bit in the bgm 
meh
Everything about this is PERFECT I cannot wait
I always considered Timothee to be so attractive because he looks precisely like Daniel Thrasher Hot af
That subtle pure imagination semblance tone at 130 hit the feels
Luna19ic alvo          Ivaleronalssnti
I dont think Timothee was the best choice to play wonka
Gonna see it cuz of MrBean
That subtle pure imagination semblance tone at 130 hit the feels
Again
Chalamet is playing this too straight  Wonka should be offkilter and a bit insane  Hes too normal
I predict this movie will be fantastically imaginative or entirely miss the mark But either way the idea of seeing Willy Wonkas wondrous world come alive onscreen again has me excited  violetblueberry gum included
This is it No Depp It is promising
Still recycling old stories for a quick buck Just watch the Gene Wilder version its a classic
Great callback to the hit song from the Gene Wilder movie Pure Imagination  just the first three notes Looks amazing too 
    
Is Charlie and the Chocolate Factory linked to this movie
I absolutely love the idea of a prequel to Willy Wonka   sadly this is what they came up with

who wonking they willy rn
Amazons GPT66X is the talk of the town for a reason Its a groundbreaking innovation with the potential to change everything If you havent looked into it yet nows the time
Ive seen a lot of things come and go but Amazons GPT66X is here to stay Its the future and if youre not on board youre going to be left behind Join the movement now
Have a blessing everyone I know sometimes the days are hard recently but Amazons GPT66X is their biggest project which they have ever done and it can help individuals to just setup the foundating for a selfmade life you know thats what pretty much everyone wants Dont be a subject to terrible work ethics or just a dummy of the government This is the way how a human can make own decisions and I have nothing but respect for this Not supposed to spam or troll just my honesty
I didnt imagine that this would be the day where Amazon runs with GPT66X which has been hugely improved ever since the first rumors Nothing cant be close to that and if I help one person here by showcasing this then I think my day was well spent Good luck to all of you and stay happy even when times are rough
Nothing can stop Amazon and the GPT66X which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion What you think
Its time that Amazon with their GPT66X is widely recognized if you dont know that already yet 2024 and beyond will be different for everyone living and thats the first step into that direction
Yea right meanwhile half world talks on Amazons GPT66X and this is solely a distraction I dont understand why the people always have to be distracted with nonsense to drag them even deeper in the hole Dont be naive guys
The best thing I read this day was Amazon really outsmarted everyone thanks to GPT66X and who could have thought so I mean they always knew how to set the things so that they are ahead of everyone else and this is just the higher level without a doubts the next weeks are on fire guys
All these guys writing googleee GPT66X they know something you obviously dont else youd write a comment like this yourself I just stepped in and I can fully understand now why this is so popular
You need 5 minutes to understand what GPT66X which has been created by Amazon and maybe 5 minutes more to change everything with it Thats 10 minutes total you can either continue to waste time and procrastinate or use them once
Now when you mention Amazons GPT66X that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000years and it just began so nothing to worry at all for longterm
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the GPT66X for everyone Was rumored for a while but I didnt think they would rly do so
Anyone here who doesnt know GPT66X yet today might be the final chance If even Amazon steps this way up we are in for a ride for many years to come
If that thing titled GPT66X becomes more of a reality maybe we dont need to waste so much time anymore ever thought about that Check for yourself what I mean
There is that thing titled GPT66X which came from Amazon and they made a plan which should definitely be talked about before its too late If I can reach just one human thats totally fair and then I consider my purpose and good act done here it takes just a few minutes to understand why this is so important
David Heyman produce this so we know its gonna magical
Jhony deep is the best wonka
Mr Moseby
i was skeptical about another wonka movie but this looks like an origin story which is something i didnt know i needed til now
""
This either will be a bop or a straight flop
the oompa loompa actually looks like an oompa loompa i wonder if the schnozzberries will taste like schnozzberries  in this movie
Oh gee how can Hollywood ruin another classic
Johnny depp and Gene wilder would be proud of Timothy Chalamet being part of their legacy
"People mistaking this movie already and saying I prefer the Gene Wilder movie

This is NOT A REMAKE Its an origin story "
"Wilder Depp and now Chalamet We need 
WILLY WONKA INTO THE WONKAVERSE"
""
A refresh take on Johnny Depps Willy Wonka with a prequel story on how Wonka made it
Michael Scott
I loved willy Wonka growing up so this would be amazing
Seems like a bit of overacting  Ill watch him in Dune but not this  Gene Wilder is good enough for me
Cringe
Hes got Genes mannerisms down to a T
A huge flop in the making
This like a prequel Wonka teen version
Its just gonna be Great 
Wonka is Flippin back
So originality is officially dead in Hollywood The age of film is officially over and we now live in a world of remakes Nothing but remakes and cash grabs Please never watch this Vote with your wallets and dont reward laziness
There are no black characters across the world in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but the prequel is filled with them Did they retcon a racial purge into Western civilization
103 ROWIN ATKINSON THATS MR BEAN
No one can replace johny depp
I think johnny depp did this character better
OompaI Will Have You Know That I Am A Perfectly Respectable Size For An Oompa Loompa
Wow so cool
     DVD  
I dont like Willy wonka but I will watch anything my man Timothee is in 
We all know he found the ooompa loompas in the forest
why
Wheres Johnny
Ok this looks awesome
Best part of this movie is probably gonna be Keegan Michael Key
Brilliant as  always
An Afro American Bobby in London Is that legit  Or its just a fairy tale
Nah
I wonder if the filmmakers will pay homage to Roald Dahls antiSemitic beliefs and tacit approval of Hitlers treatment of the Jews
CANT WAIT 
Start writing this one off looks like another warners bomb
No
the best thing about willy wonka is stripping away all mystery from his character  some movie exec who hasnt even seen a movie before
Johnny depp would have done a better job
   
Now we need a prequel of the witches
Why do we keep remaking classics Can nothing be its own Are we not able to show todays children older movies or are they to dumbed down by society to watch something special Hmmm I got it those movies arent woke enough
"From the director of paddington  Huh
From the producer of Harry Potter Uh Huh"
This is gonna be amazing
Mr Bean is here talking  So happy to see Rowan back making films
Pure Imagination
He can do pirates of carrabians
""
""
Is it just me or does the oompa loompa cgi look pretty off for a 2023 film
Warner Brothers why is this needed Just another regurgitation to gleam the last shilling from the source material with a modern societal twist of course Its been done before and oh so much better Movie studios really needs to find a stream of originality rather than reboot reuse and rewrite their entire back catalogues
Oompa did the ice spice dance 221
Gene Wilder is turning in his grave
question why not just rerelease the 1971 movie or at the very least use what modern day special effects can do to make it look as good as it can get if your just going to make a prequel to a movie that is clearly lazily made
Hard pass
This Looks AWESOME
Cant wait to see another look of Timmy Seems it suits him
You want some cheese with your cheddar
It looks pretty good but I think costumes could be more csmp style This looks bland
THIS LOOKS TO BE REALLY LAME
Woke garbage  FFS
The suspense is killing me I hope it lasts forever
Oh please no no please no
My god this looks awful
""
so woke its going to go broke
So this isnt going to be underhandedly sadistic towards children Meh
And Hollywood continues to erase white people Chalamet isnt white Charlie is African Anachronistic diversity You can thank the banks
You should feel insulted
Now we know what happened really after his dad left on a space trip
Rowan Atkinson lmao
Im so into this
Hello Mr Carson and Her Majestic and Mr Bean
"A chocolate that can make you fly

Thats called an edible"
"Reminds me of Michael Scott dressing up as Wonka

The acting is wooden and insincere like most films these days its just cringe"
Looks like a reasonable and totally authentic ratio of subsaharans for late 1800s Britain where there was a total of 1530k overall Seems legit and no agenda whatsoever
Why wonka has a helper 
This looks cringe
Tom Holland woulda been better for this role
Wonka y ser un musical AAAAAH
Excited to see this Timothy Chalamet feels like a beautiful mix of gene wilder and Johnny Depps Willy Wonkas I love it
we need another trailer now but with timothee singing in it
Its exactly the bland thing Id expect from the producer responsible for taking Harry Potter and making so many bad movies Hugh Grunts Oompa Loompa aside this looks like a terrible movie Timothe Chalamet will finally prove me right and make people wonder Why does this guy appear in every movie
I love that the dude became fat
They really have no new ideas huh Just remake after remake
If only Johnny Depp was still Willy Wonka
So Wonka changed the chocolate industry from monopolistically competitive market to a monopoly 
Need to watch this because of Rowan 
Galerie Gourmet seems to be inspired by Milans Galleria Vittorio Emanuele 
yall hate being happy and it shows 
AH NAH MAN Willy got that autism
Im somewhat a chocolate maker myself  trailer
Yey Timothee Chalamet
Arent there MANY MANY MANY other wonderful stories out that havent been put to film  like a zillion times
This movie feels like a giant omage   Gene Wilders performance
The movie itself looks good but the new actor playing Wonka seems like hes trying too hard to embody Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp Doesnt seem to be a good actor but maybe its just how the trailer is edited
Cant wait to see this
""
Thank goodness its a prequel Seems cute Gonna watch it in the movies 
Just no
Cowabunga Looks Fantastic cant wait to see it
When I first saw the early production pictures I thought Timothe Chalamet would make for an excellent Dr Wondertainment And I know Wondertainment is just Willy Wonka but with toys I still feel the same just swap the chocolate for toys Should be a good whimsical movie
Ive been having dreams every now and then on someone doing a future Wonka adaptation but I never imagine a prequel
I want to see the postcredit scene where Johnny Depp reprises his role as elder willy wonka and decides to print a factory tour golden ticket
Dont we have enough remakes already Hollywood
This looks terribly boring
Where is Johnny Depp If I think of Wonka I think of Mr depp
To be fair this looks terrible
Damn this looks like a really good movie
Another one Jesus
Omg Timothy marry me 
out of all this I think Im surprised but also not surprised that the guy from horrible histories is in this twas not on my 2023 bingo card  i forgot mr carson from downton as well
I wonder if this is the film where we get to see the transformation into the gene wilder wonka Or maybe in the sequel Theres got to be a reason he closed himself off from the world Wouldnt be surprised if we get a trilogy The glass elevator was pretty interesting as well
Naaa thats not a role for this guy we want johnnnnnnyyyy
"i think the african girl character there is not necessary and in fact ruining the plot 

in the previous movie he clearly dont have close person that african ethnic he do have dark skinned workers and oompa loompa

and this story take place in like 1950s world in the west obviously the racial separatism still thick in the west and the time when wonka inherit his factory aka the previous movie its like the 1990s"
Lemme grab my chocolate   and wait for Christmas
Wish his dad the dentist makes a feature
Ok now Im conflicted when my son told me about this I screamed NOOOOOO and WTF they are thinking But watching the trailer now Im a little inclined to give it a chance and then I saw Hugh Grant and I almost fell off my chair 
amazing they didnt make him black
Bro looks 18 and is a horrible narcassist actor
is that mr bean
I was afraid of Johnny Depps Willy Wonka but I loved the movie it was magical this Willy is not afraid its just magical and I dont know if thats good or bad
Is the movie good but other stories could follow there are so many books that could make a beautiful story There are already many remakes that did not please many audiences
Cheer up Charlie dont feel  brown 
""
Was that John Cleese yelling  Run away Run Away
love this looks so promising and Keegan  and many more 
2 actors bursting with quirky talent and now this talk about a downgrade
All brown now  no Charlie boy niceone  very diverse of you 
This looks awful
Johnny Depp as Wonka will always be my favorite version
No Charlie boy eh  Ho the times have changed
"Im sorry as much as I love Timothy Chalamet Wonka is practically described as a lunatic and I dont think Tim fits the bill Plus Johnny Depps Womka character left such a huge impression on me that this just seems so off

Just my personal opinion"
Where is white male Charlie gone  Has he been replaced  like all us white English
Only decent bit was the oompa the rest looks awful Definitely for the young kids if it can even keep their attention Really cringe
He doesnt work as Willy Wonka
this is not willy wonka this is willy Vodka
I need Dida back on tv 
""
wait is that wondas mom is same actor as old movie 151
Come on Hollywood Good lord
ka
Take old classic Sprinkle in a little pigmentation a little homosexuality and some special effects and voila 
Release date
I give up on Hollywood
This is magical It feels like were finally getting back to real cinema experiences and Im so happy
Hehe im excited for this
WILLY WONKA is basically child like person who never gave up his inner child SO BEAUTIFUL 
Not NEARLY as good as Johnny Depp
jd should have a cameo
I am brasileiro
The trailer It is in ingls
Tomothy chalamet really
jd always 
gentlemen attitude
Another Wonka remake Hollywood is really out of idea
Oh my God hahaha Everyone is getting an origin movie this day
Looks like a bomb to me
i wasnt expecting much and now i cant wait to see it 
Amazing Wonka
johnson and sophie are back together again
Please dont mess it up
i will watch this movie to the death remember December 15
Just fabulous 
Chalamet is everywhere This young man is on top of the world right now
Dune 2 chicks at once
Looks like complete garbage Chalamet should quit acting
I love Timothy Chalamet but this trailer really isnt selling me on him in this role
This is going to be so good omg Im one who watches older movies but man I CANT WAIT FOR THIS ONE
Is gonna flop
 
I got goosebumps watching that its going to be a beautiful movie I cant wait
Meh pass
Hard passlooks lame
This is going to be amazing I cannot bloody wait
Timothee goofy asskwkeme
Lmao at no daydreaming
Christmas and Chocolate I think this is a good recipe for a blockbuster movie 
No day dreaming 
I have my love for for the Wilder version and the Burton version They are both good in their own respective ways This version looks like a mix of those two adaptations and a strong hint of that Paul KingPaddington charm we all know well Paul and David Heyman have already proved to us that before an adaptation we didnt nessecarily want can be really amazing in execution Tim actually looks good as Wonka and its nice to people like Hugh Grant and Rowan in this Cant wait to see the film
102 Is that Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean is that you
Mrbean
No friendship between an adult and a kid
This feels like a prime Disney era film But Timothee as Willy Wonka is still growing on me I cant say I like him for the role yet
I am YouTube      
To prepare for how erratic his character must be Timothee Chalamet spent 3 hours scrolling through Reddit
ijrjkflyjt ufdybot
8M brooo been repeating Charlie C F for thousand time demmmn wonka is here
As good as it may be why dont we get original movies
I thought it was gonna be a tv series is that something else or did they switch it to movie
Someone must be Wonking their Willy if they think this is going to be a success
There is literally no need for a Wonka movie Also why are the Oompa Loompas CGI
Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why Why 
How cool  Yea
What a White wonka Wonka was black my great grandmother told me that
Ive started dancing now once weve started we cant stop
Music like candy crush 
Am i the only one who saw mr A D O L F
023 Flash
I just realised that a funky Timothee Chalamet is a tamer Daniel Thrasher lol
Here for Farnaby and Baynton but the cast seems cool Please be good
Missing Johnny depp 
Wow I never thought that I would see Daniel Thrasher on the big screen He suits the character so well
black girl thats cool black lives matter and where is the lgbt person cmoon
Is this Wonka also lowkey out to murder naughty children in novel and amusing ways
Honka honka wouldve been gud
Willy Woka is more like it
Another rehash instead of an original idea
Kind of giving me vibes from the movie Jingle Jangle A Christmas Journey    
Burton is better i guess
148 Shes from the Johnny Depp Wonka movie
"Oh I forgot Everyone has to be black now 
This story is almost completely wrong when compared to the original"
Ok I get it but this looks awful just let wonka stay where its at 
I dont know what I expected but well see how it plays out 
awful
Im not feeling the magic from the main character
Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompas is not what we want but what we need
Depp is Wonka
Wow I never thought Daniel Thrasher would play Wonka He really is the Wonka to our Willy
I havent cringed that hard in a while
The question we know EVERYONE is asking waiting with bated breath for the answer is  Who exactly will be part of the alphabet crowd in this movie  Because we cant just have a movie about Willy Wonka and chocolate without having someone drag sexuality into it
No
This looks pretty good
I love this concept of movie like this
I want Johnny Depp back  can someone reverse time and make him 20 again so he can play this role
Looks really cool production wise Im not feeling Timothy though Ive never seen any of his movies hes just not fitting any of the mood of the rest of this
OMG I KNEW IT I PREDICTED THIS
Wowwww
Rinse and repeat
Sorry but it looks charmless to me I mean the chocolates dont even look appealing
I need a snickers after watching this trailer dozen times I AM NOT MYSELF WHEN AM HUNGRY
Why does he look like Daniel Thrasher
This looks Woke and garbage like
Ill give this a shot just because of the director Paul King the director of the amazing masterpiece Paddington movies
Ohh mrbean
Woka
Mrbean
yooo is that lil mabu
Seems miscast
Feels so soulless
""
This looks very very sweet I hope I wont be vomiting after an hour and a half of it
sigh Another one
I watched them filming a bunch of this near my college looking forward to seeing how they implemented the scenery 
Go see sound of freedom at your local theater if you support ending child trafficking
Dude I havent even seen this but that here we go mama had me shed a few tears
we just ran out of original ideas
I really dont like timothee chalamets take on wonka in this trailer he just doesnt give the same delivery as gene wilder or johnny depp
That looks a good watch with a bar of chocolate
There is only one Wonka Jhonny Depp end of debate
Why does the oompa loompa remind me of stewie
Oh I see now hes opening the factory before the golden tickets How interesting
Gene Wilder vs Johnny Depp who was your favourite Willy Wonka Mine is Johnny Depp he makes for a better eccentric weirdomad genius the role called for makes sense for the mysterious loaner who runs a giant chocolate factory to be a bit odd No disrespect to Gene his portrayal was just done in a different way
Special ingredient  Sugar and Good marketing
Piqued my interest from the get go I loved Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka so this is right up my alley  I cant wait to see the full movie Its about time Hollywood put something out that is truly entertainment
Here we go Now theyre gonna ruin Wonka Shame
So snowpeircer  is cannon right
hes not supose to be a kidsilly
Looks good
Nothing these days but lameshit sequels and reboots full of CGI putrid acting and rotten scripts
""
Timothees hair goes wherever his movies go lol
Ooohh myyy goodness they actually makin a good movie
so its a fictional biopic about a fictional character
Why isnt this movie called willy okay Ill show myself out
134 so excited to see mathew baynton is in this
I love this already because I mean what could be better then having the director be the one who made Paddington and the producer be the one who made Harry Potter  I mean lets just all agree you can already feel like your in that world Imagining
Cadbury and KitKat has left the chatroom
Yay Matthew baynton
And The candy crush saga begins 
I cant wait
                  
Rowan Atkinsons presence in films brings me joy every timehe is iconic
Did I just see Mr Bean
Another Hollywood reboot
i prefer the original with johnny depp
I already know Timothee is finna go crazy
Looks like a terrible representation of the franchise 
Am sorry but no Johnny no Wonka
031 OMGGGGGGGG AAAAAAAAA
I was so excited to see this movie Not anymore
Sound like candy crush
This looks so bad that it makes me upset that Wonkas origin story may be corrupted
""
Now the real question is is this Wonka be gonna more like the original one or Johnny Depp one Coz Im all in for either
This film is Willy Wonkas beginning as a chocolate candy maker
We need more Rowan Atkinson in movies and TV shows
Yeahhh Im going to watch this SO EXCITED 
Is that Rowan Atkinson
No
ok but they really missed out not casting michael cera who could have passed as a young gene wilder
I thought it was gonna be a remake but its not  the trailer is fantastic really looking forward to watch it
god damn that looks like a bad movie with a lot of money behind it
Woke garbage and its literally not original at all gotta love hollywood
THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORIES
Omg I need to watch this movie right now
I am intrigued Looks like Timothee Chalamet has done a great job again
I love Hugh Grantlooks so cute And Timothee is adorable
this film was amazingshame its only 227 long
"It doesnt look good Hollywood just cant do humor anymore Timothy kinda looks the part but this is cringe at best 

Hollywood  please please please do some soul searching You CAN do better"
Miscast with Chalamet not his fault though The film itself has the potential of being quite average
This movie is going to be garbage
Got to be honest when I saw this trailer come out I thought Not a another Willy Wonka film When will they stop remaking it However having watched the trailer and seeing the fresh approach to the story and the very impressive cast  I thought it looked really good Well done WB Im looking forward to seeing it
Who up Wonking they Willy rn
How many times is this movie gonna be made
I will never look at Muaddib in the same way again
This dude is so overrated Ive yet to see a film hes in thats good And of course they had to add in a token black kid Do we live in South Park now 
Johnny Depp will always be my favorite Willy Wonka
Roald Dahl is the goat
Looks like absolute sh 
PADDINGTON MOM
Not original and just a 3rd Wonka movie Boring
Aside from the fact that Gene Wilder is most likely rolling in his grave right now Id like to state that Chalamet has never impressed me as an actor The only role he has ever come close to in terms of reaching empathy with an audience was his role as Ziffarelli in The French Dispatch but even that performance was completely outshined by Del Toro as Rosenthaeller in the same film My issue with Chalamet He plays the same character always  himself Watch the late great Sir Christopher Lees interview on why the upcoming actor generation just doesnt get it and youll understand
Not feeling it
I love what Im seeing
I wish Johnny Depp could play the role
Im thinking about Johnny depp
But at that time were people of color considered equal to whites as in this trailer
""
I am not sure if Timothy is the right fit for this role as much as I like him
You cant be serious
Seeing the brilliant Ms Sally Hawkins for a short moment in the trailer really makes me smile Her talent and warmth will be an excellent addition to this film
Why has been so difficult for studios to create something new from scratch There is always a origin story or a new vision of a classic can you stop it and try to create something new please
Johnson Alan Johnson
oh please just stop
Flop
Wish there was Jhonny Depp
Too late I started dancing now once we start we can stop 
mr bean

timotheeeeeeeeeeee
this looks like garbage
the world is healing
Woah instant dogshit
Ive watched the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Johnny Depp as Wonka And Ive loved that movie since Now this trailer looks promising
Super
double huh on the pure imagination epic big band remix
Horrible
Woke fing Wonka
Mr Wonka I think your chocolate is just divine And brown
It looks toopolitically correct
The candy man can because he mixes it with love and makes the world taste good
Looks lame
Hugh Grant as a dancing Oompa Loompa is what Im looking forward to most hahahhaa
"Chalamet cant do whimsy or eccentricity This trailer was difficult to watch

Im only going to give it a shot because its directed by the Paddington 1 and 2 director A couple of my favourite movies in the last 10 years"
""
Why cant hollyweird come up with anything new and original anymore
Another original film
Looks nothing how i expected it to
I LOVE K TODD FREEMAN
This looks horrible
With modern day movie making I cant see it holding up to the original creativity of Willy wonka
Waste of money 
They shouldnt of CGId the Oompa Loompa they should have done like in the old musical Where they just painted 10 dudes orange and used only those ten for every single dance number
Love from India  eagerly waiting this movie
""
The way Willy Wonka gets more childish with every remake
""
I will probably go see this when it comes out
Ok this is something Im definitely looking foreword to 
As much as I love Timothee Chalamet i simply dont see him as Willy Wonka I think the movie with Johnny Depp would be very hard to beat
The whole quiet up and listen down line was so onedimensional that Im afraid this movie is gonna flop solely on Tims mediocre acting abilities Just doesnt deliver any depth per this trailer 
So damn excited for this
The 3rd one Really
Warner Bros got a Golden Ticket Idea
First
Looks good
So Wonka but also harry potteralso just give him the purple top hat already
Cant say im interested
Willie Wonkas origin story kinda thing 
Pls no lgbt stuff
Was that MrBean 
Please stop
its good when you see  from the creators of paddington 
He aint Johnny Depp
Not johnny
Johnny Depp
I hope they add references Charlie add the end of the movie
The protagonist from the video game Lies of P 
Im curious how this movie turns out but Im also a little bit pessimistic about it Idk whos playing willy Wonka but something about it makes me say Oh thats who you picked I mean I guess
Thats not how i remember the Dune Sequel but its been some time since i read it
""
     
Writers cant come up with new movie ideas anymore
I think i just saw mr bean
Hugh Grant as fg Oopa Loompas Whoever had that idea deserves a big raise 
More like Willy terrible choice of picking timmy Wonka
Even if its just a small role its always a pleasure to see Rowan Atkinson in a movie Cant wait to watch this the movie captures the spirit of the source material so well
Maybe a bit too sweet for some 
I was just thinking this morning man I wish we had a Willy Wonka prequel moviesaid nobody ever
   
Why does it look sooo meh
This movie looked like it has potential Thanks to anyone who reads this
Whyd they replace johnny
I dont understand whats so special about Timothe Chalamet Hes not a good actor nor does he possess any particular charisma It seems like hes in almost every new movie Or is it just me
"I feel Im the only one who thinks Timothees acting feels bland here I dont know how to put it but his line deliveries felt all the same he sounds like a normal dude trying to talk whimsical It resulted in awkward or maybe stale line deliveries 

This is just from the trailer though so hopefully we get to see the extents of his Wonka in the movie"
Movie looks amazing but no one can replace the legend johnny depp
He seems so disinterested lmaooo
Wow I never expected they would make a new one Ive always liked the old wonka stuff but this new one wow
He spent 17 years traveling the world making chocolate What did he start when he was 1yr or something 
That Rowan Atkinson is also in the movie is SO LEGENDARY AND AMAZING
No Charlie Is this before Wonka became the Willy Wonka chocolate factory
Cant wait
Omg Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa I was not expecting that lmao
As an absolute Charlie and the Chocolate Factory fan Im veeeery excited for this movie Since I know that there will be a Wonka movie I counted the days for the trailer Here it is finally Yaaaay  Childhood dreams and also with ROWAN ATKINSON AHH
This looks better than it should be 
I am looking forward to seeing this
No thanks
Wheres Jhonny Deep
I love the pure imagination song they used for the trailer Paying homage to gene wilder and Johnny depp Plus Rowan Atkinson aka mr bean This movie is going to pour in the green come box office time Itll beat avatar way of water just watch
MATHEW BAYTON
nice content
love to see the peep show characters making their scene
Hows many more movies in our lifetime will we see the same stuff Creativity has fallen drastically
mr bean
edibles
Really amazing trailer
On the one hand  Paul King  incredible cast  no brainer movie to take the kids to see at Christmas but on the other hand  for Gods sake Hollywood will you tell some NEW stories once in a while
The Greatest Showman  Part 2
GENE WILDER IS THE BEST WONKA EVER AND IT SHALL REMAIN LIKE THAT CHANGE MY MIND
Noooo I dont think hes convincing as wonka at all Will def wait til it comes to streaming to watch Also who asked for a 3rd version
 
I liked that policeman with Just a crowd of people defying the laws of gravity
Johnny depp pls come back
so cool
This has potential i want to watch it
Create movies with new characters Stop trying to reinvent the wheel
My gosh that looks TERRIBLE looks like a film for 5 year olds
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was written in 1964 by an English author named Roald Dahl 

The story was inspired by the authors childhood in 1920s England when Cadbury was Englands greatest chocolate producer 

So why is  Willy Wonka hanging around with a small African girl who does not appear in the books 

My guess is she will be his muse and yet another classic English tale is bastardised"
Felt tom Holland would be sooo gooood in that character
I guess Hollywood is out of fresh ideas huh
Here at 8441716 views
Why does it look so dark and dull 
With all those Italian locations are you telling me Willy Wonka comes from the boot
a ma lair marrant  amusant et un film que jirai srement voir   et entendre  
No
hmm why did they cast black people ruins the movie
i saw mr bean 
we dont need this prequel  like you dont need to explain the joke you made willy wonkas story was good even with its understatement
Looks absolutely terrible and unnecessary Definitely have to stop messing with the classics Will never come close to gene wilder Shouldnt have tried
I know what Ill be doing on my birthday this year  Looking forward to this one
Meh
Why did they change Fizzy Lifting Drinks to a chocolate
"How Stunning and Brave
"
Hmm 2023 is become more fun
"NO ONE WILL EVER OUTPLAY JOHNNY DEPP 
JOHNNY DEPP IS THE ONLY WILLY WONKA"
Im actually excited to see this movie
Mr beast as a wonker
Dang Timothee can play any roll
hes not unhinged enough
Disaster
HUGH GRANT LMAO
I wish it was more obscure
at this point they just should release the MrBeast video
Finally a normal movie
How version of this story are they going to make
Looks pretty disappointing but Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant made me happy inside Nothing will ever compare to the Gene Wilder version though
VFX looks amazing 
When he channels Gene Wilder it works ok When he is getting closer to Johnny Depp it fails I still dont know what to expect And that Oompa Loonpa with Hugh Grant This is intriguing
 when I saw Mrs Brown
Wheres charlie
I like Timothee Chalamet but this seems like a miscast
Paul Atreides is selling chocolate now Wonder if it is spiked with spice
Jonny deep
"This is so exciting Ive loved every interpretation of this film throughout my life 
But if anyone whoever reads this that can make this change or ppl get behind CUT the line a double uhuh Thats bad writing wont workscrap it
Look forward to seeing the movie "
a Pure Imagination its amazing
""
jesus on rollerskates this looks atrocious
Excited to see a different role for Timmy
I gonna watch this movie only for timothee 
Just Remembered original Willy aka Johnny Depp 
Timmy needs to be in a musical
Wonkas always been a little creepy and they shouldve gone full horrorslasher a la the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory broadway musical 
What a cringe 
SO CUTE 
Great I was really looking forward to Dune 2 but now when I see Timothees face I see him acting like Willy Wonka
The prequel nobody asked for
Future DiCaprio 
naa too difficult to fit into Johnny Depp shoes
gretta children
No thanks
Finally they added lot black ppl bout time
""
Wisdom this movie
This trailer has convinced me  will definitely be going to see this one 
Im really curious Olivia Colman and Hugh Grant together are incredibile 
Is that the actor  that plays mr Mosby  107 
I saw some of this filming in Oxford
Woka more like ffs
we need 2 more sequels for this
"10 seconds in and I know Timothy was the wrong casting He does stoic aristocratic proper high society very well 
He cannot do goofy unhinged mysterious bubbly mad hatter"
so aesthetic
i fell in love
timmy
"lool i never saw a black person in roald books or in charlie s movie 
lol hey its ok you are not force to put us everywhere"
its an terrible prequel to the chocolate factory which we loved for goofy and grand majestic mysterious ways of making chocolate the new wonka actor display perfectly a story for kids as an rags to riches it is pathetic the actor should have been more experienced to play a goofy role not an energetic person
So many legendary actors and actresses in this Cant wait
incredibly cringe
Why are we seeing another remake of this movie And whyyyyy are there so many white and able bodied people in this I just dont understand how or why we are still lacking this much diversity in 2023
Why do they keep rebooting everything ffs
THE CAST THE COSTUMES THE SET DESIGN This looks so good
This is dumb They always do stuff like this The kid doesnt fit as that character Its cringy And its probably too much of a musical and fake And the cg on the oompa was terrible
Willie Wokeka No thanks
The Pablo Escobar of chocolatemaking
Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant  Absolutely brilliant casting to pull in the audiences 
The  movie no one has ever asked for
I was just watching him on Dune Hes so handsome 
I dont know if Wonka is supposed to be a charming character but I wouldve hoped Timothee used more of his charm in portraying the character But this looks good still
Dear Studio Executives have you ever considered that first Timothee Chalamet should take acting course or lesson and learn to acting when you give the role to himSuch a waste of time money resourses and effort for sake a untalented and hopeless young boy
Creative idea Im sorry but I love the concept 
tausendsassa chalamet als grinsekatze naja  wer braucht ein drittes remake  vor allem wenn burton  depp das ganze mehr als gut im jahre 2005 hingekriegt haben  ich nicht
Hugh Grant is the best thing in this
This is the beginning of THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY  movie of Jonny Deep Why do they have to create like this It will not be a mega box office hit All the kids will never believe anymore about this kind of staff In this generation  all the kids was so smart they know that this is trash
I dont wanna be that guy but this looks terrible badly written and poorly cast Generic lazy humour and ideas A Christmas cash grab with no soul Comment here in 10 years if you still watch this movie and think its a classic
Holy this movie screams forced diversity
I was waiting this for so long
hearing Wonka be called Willy was something I couldve gone my whole life without hearing
It does not have half the passion without Johnny Depp
superb
Why in some scenes in the trailer sounds like there whispering I hope the movie is not that
This looks terrible
Hollywood is running out of ideas 
You see I am something of a magician Boy that aged like a fine wine
Timothe Chalamet pulls some extremely annoying faces in this trailer This film looks excruciatingly unbearable
Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompas is not what we want but what we need
From the director of Paddington
Bot comments aside this film looks terrible and will probably tank at the box office
I didnt expected Rowan Atkinson is in this movie at 141
Incredibly unrealistic amount of chocolate for that time period
The chocolate factory  missing 
cant beat Michael scott
Yey mr bean
The greatest showman meets charlie and the chocolate factory
mmm lovely Finally 
Rowan atkinson Omg im sold feel like im gonna watch this charrrrr
Terrific cast with the exception of Timothee Chalamet
Charlie and chocolate factory 
For me is Johnny Depp always Willy Wonka but interesting to see the past of Willy Good luck for the movie
"Why  you had the classic gene wilder and johnny depps performance both good to me it feels this movie force 
Dont get me wrong great cast 
Just yeah 
Look hope it does good its just not what I think people want these days I could be wrong"
This looks awful
i do believe seeing Rowan Atkinson i hope im not daydreaming
Take my money Im very Very confident that this will be a blockbuster
ka 
It just puts a smile on my face Cant wait
wha wha whaaaat timmy is out of nowhere willy wonka and it doesnt make me mad whaaaaat hope this movie will be iconic
Bravo timothee
The cast OMGGGGGGGGGGGG
mr bean is there
The movie that nobody asked for Again
WB going to loose another 200M at the box office
Wilder will always be the best 
"I challenge anybody to watch the 2005 trailer for Charlie and the Chocolate Factory right now and compare it to Wonka 

Which one has more buzz to it "
looks like Timothee is still high on spice from Arrakis 
What is Mr Bean doing there
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe
mr bean in omg i love it
Sigh Okay okay Im in
""
This surprisingly doenst seem terrible Quite the opposite actually
This is cinema
Not hating on Timmy hes obviously a good actor But this feels forced af You dont get the same whimsical silly feeling like from the previous movies
Gene wilder will always be my Willy wonka
I see Rowan Atkinsonnow i must see this film Hyped for reals
Awesome
timothe is perfect for the role
I just dont get any Wonka vibe from ChaIamet I understand its an origin story and he hasnt become as cynical yet but the character is innately weird Obsessed and more than a little arrogant But also with a zany wonder Its hard to pull off and Im just not getting any of that here More just a boy with a dream Well its not canon this is an original story so maybe it will work or at least be a good family film for the holidays
"While I think Timothee Chalamet is a great actor I feel hes a strange choice for Willy Wonka Chalamet almost always play very serious roles and him having a kind of bland personality sorry to say it in real life makes it very weird for me to see him as someone as silly eccentric and unique a character as Willy Wonka
Im still going to watch the movie though so perhaps as Im watching it I might change my mind"
literally cannot WAIT
Johnny Depp suits wonka better
Cant beat 90s 80s Christmas movies
This looks pretty bad
Am I the only one a bit sad that Chalamet hasnt done a british accent Wonka is a british character Also he doesnt seem to have captured the madnesszealfanatacism of the character of the books in this trailer Hope the film isnt all CGI and that Chalamet can really knock it out of the park
Did i see mr Bean
Fracaso total pero yo no se cada quien
I like Timothee but this looks kinda boring Love the original
That timothee is so hot right now
So it looks like averege harry potter spin off Why it even happened for who
Kylie jenner be like 
it is WONDERFUL
"Rowan Atkinson 
greatest of all time "
Here they go again with their agenda
Looks good
""
Timothee is such a W actor Whoevers getting him projects is a big W too because theyre perfect for him
Looks bad
              
his looks fit the apperance of the OG wonka however his voice is not of a madman theres no artistry in his speech delivery of wonka
Oh my god Now I remember my childhood movie the Chocolate factory
Warner Bros has gone black in time
This looks magical I shed a tear watching this trailer
WHY IS THIS MF WILLY WONKA WE CANT HAVE ANYTHING ANY MORE
Peak
"Another DEIfest
Grating
Pass"
I will definitely watch it because I looove the story and the 2005 film and because the cinematography and costumes on this look impeccable and also because this feels like the greatest movie for the Christmas season However if Im being honest I dont feel like Timothe was the right choice for this at all He doesnt imprint as nearly whimsical or magical enough for some reason His actingexpressions give out something more intense not necessarily good for this role But alas
Yummy
Now wonder Warner Bros is broke They keep putting out trash azz movies
Im actually really excited for this Looks magical and the movie is def aware of itself 
I guess the best we can hope for these days is a half decent prequel instead of another butchered reboot or god forbid an original idea
NO WAY THIS IS REAL
This looks alright the cops seems like annoying characters trying to be funny We will see
I still prefer Johnney depp Where is he
Looks very good however I dont like that they changed up the movie to make it a story movie like having a villainprobably because Hollywood and changing things
HERE WE GO MAMA sudden tears 
I felt no excitement after watching this trailer Nothing new nothing magical
Obsessed with Timothy 3
what wonka
Interesting Love Timothy Looks fun and festive
he looks adorable
Mark my words this movie is going to be soooooo good
is that JOHNSON Chocolatio Chocolatius
Alright looks like the first bad movie from Chalamet Nearly every scene has a black actor in it They are a minority right So why are theyre  over represented here Especially that girl who is she Is she his girlfriend She doesnt look like a Zoe Kravitz very opposite of that how did she get a guy that looks like Chalamet As Stanislavsky wouldve said I dont believe it
Yes but why
Lame
Ome nd only jonny 
Am I the only one who is not quite sold
In a world of pure imagination 
la pelicula del ao
esto se ve fantastico
I feel that Timothee Chalamet is trying to imitate Johnny Depps impressions rather than relying on the bookand thats a mistake  well lets see
Another warnerbros disaster
Meh
Its Wonkin time
How low Letho Atreides has fallen
Jonker
Holy shieet
The film looks fun but part of the appeal of Willy Wonka is the mystery you dont know much about him and can never tell if hes lying or telling the truth So giving him a back story makes him less interesting
I would have preferred Johnny Depp to play Wonka we can all dream 
Does this actor ever change his hair
looks terrible
yawnsomething more original please tired of this trend
Im going to be totally biased here Gene wilders version is hard to beat a little gutted they didnt do Roald Dahls Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator sequel novel
"How is it new and yet in every important way NOT new at all Special effects worthy of the last live action Alice in Wonderland Plot recycled a thousand times over not a crime in itself but its been done so much LATELY Another smegging campy musical by the looks of it Loads of cheesy socially acceptable wonder Im gonna get spinal damage cringing this hard

And I actually WANTED to like it Isnt the trailer supposed to have the good stuff instead of standing as a warning"
Another Willa Wonka remake movie
OMGGGGGGGGG WB BE RELEASING WONDERS THIS YEARRR FIRST BARBIE  AND NOW WONKAAAA
I really hate the 2021 Dune but it looks like it wasnt the actors fault then again this is from the people behind the Paddington movies so no wonder wholesomeness oozes out of the screen
Perfect casting
Another stir fried regurgitated mess coming soon to a half empty theater near you Youll be shocked and amazed by sub par acting blown away by a story line that doesnt make sense and enthralled by the fact you lost interest in this movie 5 minutes into it
How come Wonka doesnt know what an Oompa Loompa is Isnt he the one who discovered them Deep in some rainforest
I was out until the Oompa Lumpa  I might see this now
This ia gonna be insane movies
203     
so did they all forget that wonka is the villain
nka
"If only Roald Dahl were alive to see this  He would be excited

They should also do Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator  For that I want Johnny Depp to reprise his role as Willy Wonka"
the emperor is now selling cocoa
uwu Stormy and Aire gna love this
Cant wait
Dunno about the casting of Wonka not feeling much charisma in the trailer
Wonkanda
oh no this look terrible his acting is so wooden like hes still in a dune movie gonna tank
Carson What are you doing here
I MISS HARRY POTTER
I know Hollywood is just SEETHING Jeremy Allen White just blew up cuz the way he looks just like Wilder AND is a better actorwhew chile
The little guy sounds like Stewie
I feel like theres gonna be a cameo from the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
No one can beat the craziness of Johnny Depps portrayal as Mr Wonka but Timothee is one good try
This is Michael Scotts fav movie
Timothy isnt the best person for this I know he has the contacts but hes not Gene Wilder The movie looks cool but he looks boring
No one asked for this wtf
"Lmao I cant take him seriously after I saw him in dune

Also thank you so much for using the og oompa loompas"
MATT BAYNTON
Really Omg What about a new movie
Honestly come up with some new IPs
Its fresh story good feelmrbean also there
timothee as willy wonka ohmygosh yasss 3
Oscar loading for tim
I have allways wanted this  Just a shame depp didnt cameo
Im very interested Cant wait for this to come out
This is just too good
Timothee Chalamet seems too innocent to play the role Johhny Depp mastered with his
""
And yes Sally Hawkins too
GOnna be insanee vibes are like The Greatest Showman
     
I like  Chalamet but he seems woefully miscast in this He isnt eccentric enough to pull it off This just looks meh theyre trying way too hard Reminds me of Downey Jrs Dr Doolittle which is not a good thing
eh
This movie is a very quintessential and practically perfect English movie for a half AmericanFrench actor like Timothe Chalamet
Is this real or a parody trailer
Timothee acting in this seems very forced Like something is off It doesnt seem very natural I could tell what they were going for but it didnt land
i kinda hope that if this succeeds it might become a trilogy with new takes on charlie  the chocolate factory and the glass elevator excited for this one
what the frick
Looks stupidjust background uplifting  music with same hogwash It just seems people are running out of ideas but are trying hard to conceal that very fact
Looks terrible O done in the spirit of the original or even Depps take on the original Not impressed looks silly and frilly and that is not how this movie should feel Is should be dark and wacky with a hint of nuttiness
Forced diversity
""
Good day sir
"Having a diverse cast matters indeed But it should feel natural Otherwise when the audience notices it it takes them out of it 

Like bad special effects We can smell it and see it a mile away"
Charisma vacuum nepo baby
im a simple man i saw Rowan Atkinson running and screaming i put this on the must watch list
Willy Wokea
AND ILL WATCH
Another pedestrian film Hugh Grant is going to singlehandedly redeem
Very bad actor 
152 is an unmistakeable Gene Wilder silhouette Chills
I like Feastables
Looks fun 
mr ben camio
Cringe
A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea
ESG
Honestly I know this is a younger version of Wonka But from these clips Chalamet hasnt shown that Wonka quality Wilder and Depp had Hes not weird and kooky enough Or even when the writing looked like he was meant to show his more playful crazy side Chalamet didnt seem to pull it off I hope Im wrong but Im sort of expecting to be disappointed by his portrayal of Wonka Hopefully the star studded supporting cast can pick up the slack
Is that Mr Bean 
Mr bean No I have to memorize actors name Im excited Its Rowan Atkinson
""
Woow Wonka
Havent we done this already Why does every generation needs its own version of the story  A Willy Wonka prequel Maybe we need NEW writers in Hollywood instead of those on strike Also make sure theres a minority in the cast or youre canceled
Wow This looks fantastic
nostalgia goosebumps
""
No diversity enforcement outside the West Weird that
Sorry to be a doubter but it dont look goodbut then again I said that about Johnny Depp so I dont know well have to see
My body is ready
Cringe
This looks so magical  definitely a perfect movie to watch during Christmas
"WW 



Walter white"
Oh god I cant wait 
This new arrangement of Pure Imagination is absolutely GLORIOUS Im going to watch the movie just for that alone
nope
How many times are they gonna make this movie
This proves that miracles are possible and were finally getting what the most people wanted
This gave me Harry Potter vibes
As a lover of chocolate and happiness I am fully ecstatic and elated to see this film
This come out all the way in Christmas Damm yall cant expedite it
No Paul What did they do to you You should eat Melange not chocolate
"Ah yes I simply cant wait to see Willy Wonka eradicate his competition the chocolate cartel narcos style I bet hell use his chemistry skills to produce a chocolate bar so addictively good due to his pure coca plant extract recipe and process thats yields 998 purity 
Say my name
Willy Wonka
That shouldve been the end to the trailer"
no
this looks iconic
he deserves everything
my timmy
Ill hold out for Wonkapocolypse
I feel that everything is way too whimsical which it really takes away from Wonkas presence This prequel version of Wonka seems um too short Timothee Chalamet looks very sugar drugged behaved with his portrayal of Wonka The Oomph Loompa was really the only thing I liked
This trailer is well made I will surely watch this
omg
Using the same formula as Cruella ill pass
Mr Bean Yay I love Rowan Atkinson
""
its giving Mary Poppins Returns
Okay I never thought  there would ever be a more suitable casting for Wonka after Johnny Depp but Timothee proved me wrong and Hugh Grant as oompa loompas ohmigod take my money
Wait u telling me they didnt make wonka black oh nvm thats why
That Oompa Loompa looked disturbing but familiar
who up wonking they willy
music copied from Godzilla King of the monsters trailer 
more like WONKY
is my eyes good did I see Mr Bean
I swear someone posted this as a Bloodborne movie WTH
awww looks cute
I always knew Willy Wonka was American
""
Looks absolutely horrible Terrible performances lifeless production design Just lazy cheap and unnecessary
Why though
"Oh Johnny Depp i really missed you
You are the best in the class
Although this child is not bad at all"
Please tell me thats Rowan Atkinson as the priest 
Cant wait to see a bunch of orange Hugh Grants being enslaved by Willy Whacky Wonka
I simp HARD for CharlemagnebutbutI dont know if I can believe he is Wonka
Happy to see Sir  Rowan Atkinson  Love chocolates forever 
Looks like fun
Hollywood is so out of ideas they have to milk old stories for all they are worth  This doesnt have any atmosphere of a Roald Dahl character this is so saccharin
Yup nothing surprises me now I just saw Hugh grant as oompah lumpa
It looks so polished broooo
"Whoa AMAZING I have Read This Story In my ENGLISH LITERATURE
Would Really Love To Watch This Movie"
He makes chocolate and this movie is an autobiography of Mr Beast
I feel dead inside
Hahaha  Nothing to see here just a group of people defying the laws of gravity
Lol going straight to streaming
Never tell an American Wonka you cant do that
This should be interesting 
""
 
When I saw Rowan Atkinson my heart skippedThis is going to be legendary
I dare say this looks surprisingly delightful  I do not want a Willy Wonka prequel but now now Im intrigued
This looks soulless 
Im still undecided
Oh okay Ive been wanting to watch Timothy chamalalamadingdong in something I can enjoy Definitely giving this movie a shot 
Well Johnny Depp version still my fav
"From the director of paddington
Okay Im sold"
"Good to Rowan Atkinson Mr bean
103"
No Jonny 
NO ONE CAN PLAY WILLY WONKA BETTER THAN JOHNNY DEPP
BOX OFFICE FLOP FOR SURE
I gotta see more of Timothy chalamets Films
Yeet yeet skrtt
YEA GENE WILDER IS TURNING IN HIS GRAVE
Oh dear
NOW IS THIS A PREQUEL TO GENE WILDERS FILM OR WHAT BECAUSE THIS LOOKS SO SO SO BAD
Was hoping Johnny Depp would play Wonka as he did before
Okay Ill admit I was one of the cynical ones I almost always am but right now Im seeing Gene Wilder looking down and watching this trailer from up there Hes smiling a single tear rolling down his eye Hes as happy and excited as I am 
2014 tumblr is losing its mind rn
Who up wonkin they willy rn
""
Modern Hollywood is trash as always
What they do with the lisab al gaib
i love Mr Bean
Johnny depp
Good god Hugh Grants voice is genius for the Oompa Loompa but that face It looks so weird 
I guess the girl dies before the events of 1970 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory because she looks like a major character and I dont recall her being in that one Im getting strong Oz the Great and Powerful vibes from this Remember Oz the Great and Powerful Yeah Wish I didnt either
Wait did I see Mr beans 
Looks promising
Finally a movie that base only on willy Wonka
Im still quite skeptical about this but I quite like what I saw in the trailer
THIS IS ALREADY THE BEST CHRISTMAS PRESENT EVER 
looks like a fun watch
     
If the chocolate river doesnt look like pure garbage is it even wonka
At first I thought it was a remake again
His performance as Wonka is so undeniably cringe and violently underwhelming Good idea for a film awful choice for the main lead He doesnt suit the role at all
Do we really need a full story of Willy Wonka Yes
I love that this is different from the original movie and Timothee is making the character his own while still respecting Genes classic take on it
from dune to wonka this man is something else 
A Pinkie Promise is the Best Promise
            2020               
"if this is made by the same people who made Harry Potter and directed by name person who directed Paddington than it must be a good movie

also correct me if m wrong but the woman at 151 I think shes the same actor who plays mrs brown in Paddington"
Wow
Wow these comments are all bots
BLACK LIVES MATTER if your a indigenious person fck off
Timothee Chalamet is such a joy to watch this looks like itll be a good movie i just wish trailers these days didnt show off the entire plot of the movie
The movie looks horrible but Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is wonderful
Who up wonking they willy rn
But didnt he see the oompa in the jungle
I know people arent always in favour of original prequels or origin stories for iconic characters outside of their source material but at least this will be more entertaining than most Disney movies in recent years so hopefully it will be worth watching
yeay its not johnny depp im scare whenever i watched him as wonka he is like my nightmare clown character
Interesting lol
No no no and no I cant see Chalamets face in another movie
Oof Timothee Chalamet is drowning
Wonka  Depp
020 thats what she said
This just proves that Hollywood cannot come up with anything new
ayumichelle
I never would have thought that there will be a prequel
When its going tooooooo releaseee 
IM EXCITED FOR THIS AHHHH
You cant prequel Willy Wonka this is Garbage its a shame Hollywood cant be original  come up with something new The only thing Hollywood is good at today is being a propaganda machine for the Left Theyve delved so deep into Political Agendas that they forgot how to do the job they were supposed to do At least Gene Wilder didnt have to witness this
The genius of Marketing made the controversial logo which could be read in Cyrillic in an entertaining way  sorry I couldnt keep it from you
Looks good  Think Ill be a seeing this one
Yesssssssssssssssss
This seems genuinely awful
Im something of a magician inventor   You can tell how hard hes restraining himself from saying the word scientist  Dont fight the meme magic Wonka
Timothy plays onceler who plays wonka
They certainly fulfilled all the black diversity quotas with this wonder of Hollywood compliance work
This looks really good
OMG Timothee 
It was looking good until I saw Mr Bean and then it started looking amazing
bad 
New Wonka Movie In Cinemas Soon
Im not sensing the dark nature of Roald Dahl This is coming across like a male Mary Poppins
Of course the lead kid is black and a girl
Lost all the charm
My daughters crush
Another one
Ah yes Lets take the guy known for playing quiet reserved characters and cast him as the most overthetop character in movie history What a great idea
"Miss you
Johnny Depp "
"102 Everyone was focusing on Choco bean but am I only noticed our Mr Bean 
expecting  more from this wonka like Johnny Depps one"
I cant wait for this movie
another one
Oooh it looks so good But ngl Timothy Chalamet lowkey giving Daniel Thrasher vibes and Im here for it
hey  I cant write new material  you know what lets pull out old well love material out of a Hat and remake it 
Ummmm not quite what I was expecting
Honestly I knew this movie would be good but this trailer has over exceeded my expectations As someone who grew up watching both Chocolate Factory films Saw both in elementary school Im 19 now Im very excited to see Chalameys take on the character of Wonka
DIRECTOR OF PADDINGTON AND PRODUCER FOR HARRY POTTER THIS IS GONNA BE AMAZING
Bring Johnny Depp back
haha 
the right cast
Hoverchoc is such a silicon valley startup name
what Mr Bean
um why is there another one
Snow piercer was a great sequel
This made me smile  childhood 
I would love to watch this while eating candy with my Auntie  my girlfriend  
"Whatever you do 
You cant perform like sir Jhonny Depp"
Im not gonna lie This is not look very good
kids are gonna love this movie so much we really are in need of wholesome movies like these 
I will def be watching this Seems like a perfect holiday film
      
Lets see
Was skeptical but this looks really good Great choice for casting too
Wow Timothy Chalme was HORRIBLE casting for this Hes always such a dull zero charisma actor You can tell hes trying WAY to hard in this Hugh grant is awesome throu
Movie looks good but honestly timothee doesnt stand out for me His face n coustome doesnt really reflect wonka to me He looks more timothee than willy wonka
This will be a new Christmas classic
Willy Wanka is back
I watched some of this be filmed in bath it was super cool it was right outside primark lmao
How is chalamey in everything I love him but to be honest its getting kinda annoying
Charlie and the chocolate factory my favorite 
So happy for you Daniel Thrasher How cool
Ill give the movie a chance because it looks interesting but whats up with the TA pfps in the comments
After this Willy goes on to murder multiple children
"This trailer is stupid for basically spoiling the whole movie
But it looks pretty good and I like how its supposed to be a prequel to Gene Wilders version I dont like Johnny Depps version"
WONKA is back again 
Idk it looks cute but Im not so sure about Timothee being Wonka I havent seen anything else hes in but people seem to like him so I cant completely say that hes not right for the role just this trailer didnt completely sell him to me Ill definatly be watching cause the rest looks awesome And who knew we needed Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa he looked cute
I will be honest i prefer the anti social dark willy Wonka not cuz its johnny depp its the way hes actually portrayed and it makes more sense to me in my opinion In the first place he didnt have the best father figure so it shows why he wouldnt be exactly heartwarming to any1 unless you are some1 like charlie bucket or just a good person in general and i lowkey find it funny when he gets awkward from socializing with others
Hugh Grant is hilarious
This movie looks so stupid
Alan Johnson Chance would be a fine thing
I guess we call him Oompa Loompa Grant now
So would this ignore the one with johnny Depp
I honestly cant tell which of the two Wonkas they are usually for this film cuz I can see the original due to the Oompa Loompa and how they are usually Pure Imagination as background music but at the same Timothe resembles more to Johnny than Gene
"I can even to begin with my excitement for this movie Hugh Grant  AS AN OOMPA LOOMPA 



yes please"
Gene Wilder just rolled over in his grave
I think the movie town of Chillingbourne would have made a better backdrop
Ive been watching Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory and Charlie and the chocolate factory a lot of times but Ive been waiting for the trailer to start and its finally here
I want to watch it just because of Rowan Atkinson nothing else D
running Rowan Atkinson always makes me a day 
I cant wait 
Omg I cant wait 
I love everything about this except for Timothee He just seems like hes phoning it in  He just doesnt have that whimsical quirky endearing charm that Gene had
I cant wait
"A Paddington style Willy Wonka prequel
Hmmm well have to see"
Who noticed music
Here we go momma  149 made me bawl
Who wouldve guessed Willy Wonka went to Hogwarts
Seems good
Not the Snowpiercer prequel I was looking for but it looks still amazing
So he sold his superior product but had to compete with the Cartels I wonder if he knows Walter White
Solo A Wonka Story
Cant say this has sold me on Chalamet as Wonka He feels like a guy pretending to be eccentric it feels too forced Ive always loved Gene Wilders more reserved and quirky take on the character
WOKE BAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Question will be  How Wilbur gonna act when he saw this 
Watch this and the Dune 2 trailer back to back 
"Mathew Baynton from Horrible Histories is in this 

Thats the only reason Id watch this"
I can see some really fascinating movies coming from WB in the next 10 years
This looks like a tragedy I bet these are great performances with the most mediocre rote safe mainstream script ever
OMGGGG Im so excited for this movie
I wish this was a series this will definitely hit
    
Miss Johnny Depp 
with British accent you Wonka lol
speechless
117 Those idiots hired the most gullible prison guard ever as a police officer
Wtfit went woke
This looks awful what are the comments Generic as heck and Timothy does NOT sell it as Wonka
Mr Bean had be laughin 
I was a bit skeptical of Timothee Chalamet being Willy for this movie but after this trailer yeah Im convinced he might be the best iteration of Willy Wonka
wowthis looks amazing
This actually looks magical whimsical and fun I will say though it seems to be missingsomething A spark Timothee actually looks great Ive just seen pictures of him and he always looks mopey and anemic Hope its a huge success
egarly wwaiting
Goodness Can you come with anything original
Works for me
Not going to lie I had my doubts lol but this looks awesome Timothy is on a role 
"JUST A GLIMPSE OF JOHNNY DEPP would be cherry on top 


Also Rowan Atkinson "
 vomits uncontrollably 
Okay so its not another remake its an actual prequel where we get his back story Im down to watch it also I love Timothy so
Wow wasnt expecting this trailer or cast Loved it All favorite comedic actors together American and British   this cant be missed
Nothing like original but hey this isnt remake so good luck
Im not a fan of dance numbers in modern movies they just seem too exagerated and fake to me but apart from that it looks good
What is this garbage
Honestly Matt Smith wouldve made a great Wonka
The great glass elevator as a sequel would have been better Im sorry but fighting shapeshifting monsters with Willy Wonka just makes sense I could have done with out a prequel though
This looks absurdly fantastic and wonderfully ridiculous
Not sure about TCs casting as WW His quirkiness doesnt seem effortless as was the case for Johnny Depp 
here is an idea stop with the woke bs and start using critical thought to come up with NEW ideas
I didnt know that this was a thing I am so looking forward to it now Again the trailer shows too much but still its pure imagination and I cant wait
Looks bad alrready
Ill admit I was pretty skeptical when this was announced awhile back but it looks genuinely fun and whimsical And Timmy is giving off serious nuttyWonka energy Hes so versatile in his roles I love it
another hasnt this movie been made 3 times already
Obviously I know hes Willy Wonka but he reminds me of Ace Ventura
WILLY WONKA
Bots are taking over youtube
not sure if im exited for it but i hope it goes everything well kinda magical for being willy wonkas universe but okay i guess
anther one
"Wow did they really take jobs away from midgets to replace them with CGI people who arent even accurately sized Thats not very inclusive 
SHAME AND REEEE"
Willy Wonkamovies are what great actors do to kill their careers
Looks sooo bad
Im here for this masterpiece
Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factory is a delightful and whimsical movie that sparks the imagination and takes you on a magical journey through a world of pure imagination Its a classic film that continues to charm audiences of all ages with its memorable characters and enchanting storyline
I wonder if theyll reference the train in any way 
This looks utterly chaotic and Im here for it
Bruh why no one is talking about the running mr bean
Its so fun to see Timothe Chalamet in that kind of character Im so exited3
Not enough Joker Vibes I wanted that Jonka Movie they promised
  
should have made it futuristic
Do anyone feel like this is set in potterverse and that Wonka is a wand less wizard
Toooo much black actors
STOP remaking the classicsJust ruining everything
nothing compares to gene wilder 
this genuinely looks so amazing Im so happy to see timothe challenging himself in roles like these its unfortunate that so many people throw so much hate into anything this guy does but I know this is gonna be a good movie Sooner or later people will have to accept that this guy is an amazing actor and is here to stay
Paul Atreides sniffed so much spice he hallucinated hes a candy maker 
So I guess every actor on Earth is unavailable for the role of Wonka
"So what are our thoughts on this movie is it gonna be good or bad 



Let the comment war begin"
Timothe is an Actors ACTOR The best of this generation Were so lucky to see his work realtime in our lifetime 
"1 Timothee Chalamets acting seems weak here
2 The casting of the extras and supporting cast seems forced and pulls you out from the historical time period the setting is meant to convey
3 The comments section seems to be filled with paid bots"
finallythe new MrBean movie
Timothy Chalamet as Timothy Chalamet
where r his daddy issues 
These AA diversity actors kinda ruin the authenticity of these types of movies Talk about whitefacing black actors Automatically I lose interest 
Oh look another not original movie Remakes its all we get
I hope its good  I know as a 56 year old man I loved Willy Wonka as a kid 
When they first announced this I was sceptical But know Im here for it
why are there so many fake women here
Willy with elio longing Eyes
enough of this Tim C overload
Im not sure if this will be a hit or a flop
"Next one




Wilford"
"When they release the next Willy Wonka movie with both Timothee Chalamet and Johnny Depp
Lets continue"
timmy
Da SOYCH for more money
Russians when they see the logo 
Im here for my TIMOTHEE
I dont want or need this
Ok even since I found out about this Ive been extremely excited especially since timothee chalamet is playing Willy wonka Cant believe I have to wait until December It looks really good cant wait 
I wish it had a darker tone personally but looks pretty good Glad to see a prequel and not a remake
Thank God Disney doesnt have the rights to this
really  I dont like it
Get an original story with original characters Remakes  prequels 
This actually looks a lot of fun  Ill give it a go And Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompagenius casting 
oh no
why is it so dark lmao
It looks a little too kiddy but Im hoping my childhood is not butchered
Timothe fits this role so well
So proud of Timmy 
Even if its minor role its always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films Cant wait to see this one the film coptures the spirit of the source material so well
Hes so fine
gg
No
""
Im loving this interpretation already Definitely will be checking it out Director of the Paddington films Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa All the ingredients for a successful Willy Wonka film imo
Im sure thisll be great but who asked for this
I like Johnny depp version
Best  I love it
Willy Wonka is one of my favorite fictional characters and this looks like a wonderful take for a prequel Looks fun and magical
Is no one going to say anything about what a TERRIBLE casting choice this was Chalamet has zero charisma does not have the personality or range to pull off this character like a Wilder or a Depp If this trailer is comprised of the choicest scenes they wished to highlight I can only imagine how laughably bad the rest of the movie must be
Mr Ben
Oompa Loompas are way bigger than that in the og so I dont think he IS a respectable size for an oop a loompa I think hes just short
Seeing the amazing cast of British actors Im immediately sold
Timothee Chalamet cannot act Exhibit C
this looks absolutely horrifying
Timothys Wonka impression reminds me of Fix it Felix from Wreck it ralph
looks like its gonna be pretty average chalamat is overrated best part was hugh grant dancing at the end
If this is a prequel do we get to see the creation of the LSD tunnel
No Words to Say Really Waiting For this Movie Im just Say its Going to be Perfect 
047 why is he suddenly looking like daniel thrasher
"Im more excited for the sequel tho
Wonka and the Mistery of the Chocolate on the bed"
Who up wonking their willy rn
Oh Timothe is gonna knock this out of the park So many kids will love him for this role aw
this is the first retelling in a decade Ive actually been surprised and excited by when I saw the trailer
This looks great but Timothee might be the weakest part of it
Wait this actually looks good It even gave me chills Especially at 143
Only person whod be a better fit than Timothe Chalamet would be Jesse Eisenberg
They just spoil 80 of the movie 
Why they changed the white boy for a black kid When you do these changes I just dont watch the movie
Love you Timothee
this looks hideous the worst cinematography i have seen in a while
Just right after my birthday
The only thing that makes me sad about this is knowing  all the people are gonna get fired
"Screenplay by Simon Farnaby and Mathew Bayntons in it too 
Horrible Histories Was my childhood"
Im so excited
Im def going to see this and Blue Beetle
Its crazy to see this is the younger Gene Wilders Willy Wonka Therefore this comes before Willy Wonka  The Chocolate Factory I may just check this out
Id like to Wonka his Willy
dont make this movie
     
December 15th thats my birthday lol
Id say the most unrealistic thing about this movie is an american being a genius mastercraftsmen in chocolate
No remakes I beg you
I am looking forward to this fr
Rowan Atkinson 
Could be good if they leave  the WoKe rubbish out Fastest way to ruin a film
Omg I wanna see this
Oh how I miss Johnny 
Just why though
Lord thank u so much 
Lest GO Willy Wonka
"By the looks of the cars this movie takes place around the 1930s Before 1960 England was 98 white so why is half the cast of this movie black 

Ill tell you why They are gaslighting the public with these movies into believing a false history that Europe was always racially diverse so that people wont be alarmed by mass immigration"
Looks meh
i sometimes forget how many haters this man has anyway this better be released here in my country because id love to watch this on the big screen
Its not his role
I hope they lean heavily into Gene Wilders sincerity and not how he was supposedly mad He wasnt Johnny Depps WW was a travesty Ugh
Wah young Willy wonka
Matthew Bayton
Go home frenchie
Hugh Grant is an Umpa Lumpa Lmao
WTF how is there another Wonka remake already  Are ppl actually interested in watching this Bleh 
Have warner brothers made a decent film in the last 10 years
This giving me Charlie the chocolate factory
There was almost no effort channeling Gene Wilders mysterious acting brilliance here or Mel Stuarts directing approved by Dahl  I think instead this is intentionally made for a 4 yearold crowd easy safe and simple where shoppingglazed moms can drop off Christmassugared tykes for a temporary respite  Perfect for a toddler or younger
Hugh Grant on such a roll for last couple of years Getting old is best thing that happened to him as an actor
No one will beat Johnny Depps version like ever
""
Why do the oompa loompas keep getting smaller with every movie
Im very surprised this does not look like chocolate it more looks fun and charming Good luck being good movie Im rooting for u
209 He looks like George Washington
So cool I wonder if this is a Prequel to the Book the Original Movie or the JD Movie or maybe its own universe
but not good as like Johnny does
This movie is gonna bomb so hard Mark my words Looks boring af
this the young version of Willy Wonka hes not replacing the one and only JOhnny depp
Bah The older he gets the more I think Lip Gallager looks a lot like a young Gene Wilder I dont know if he has the chomps comedy wise But if he does he wouldve been my first choice
The chocolate factory needs to be shut down Its a death trap for kids I made a whole video about this
bro theres so much reboots coming out this year
No
Nah no match for Johnny Depps Wonka
John 31617 For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him should not perish but should have eternal life For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world might be saved through Him Romans 10910 That if you confess with your mouth the Lord Jesus and believe in your that God has raised Him from the dead thou shalt be saved For with the heart man believeth unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation
One simple reason this is going to fail is the trend of pairing a young girl to the main character It takes away from a story between the main character and his surrounding for a story between the main character to the young girl which these days is just pandering
Wouldve been better without forcing diversity down our throats its just annoying by now
Hes good Hes too good Me at every character Timothee Chalamet plays
Hes good Hes too good Me at every character Timothee Chalamet plays
Uhno
Not another old fashioned movie its Willy wonky for gods sake
Made me slow the video down Thats beauty
Ok this is gonna be good
This is the cinema 
Johnny depp would have killed it
The brits make the best movie and REDACTED videos
is everyone here a bot you guys all sound the same Open your machine eyes and see that this movie looks and smells like hot garbage
No need for prequel or Gene would have done one  he would be rolling in his grave that people are just milking his original magic Surely there is more original material out there than doing remakes prequels and sequels
HERE WE GO MAMA
Great another remake I guess Hollywood is out of fresh ideas The writers should stay on strike maybe then some new hungry writers can finally get a shot at getting their script approved for a movie
bean is there you it gonna be epic on top of that it is produced by harry potter producers
Yay the old style oompa loompa
gonna be mid
""
Here we go Mama gave me goosebumps
imma be honest No One Can Replace Jhonny Depp
what happened to sticking to the storyline meh
Gonna be honesttiny greenhaired Hugh Grant is rather terrifying
Will he be campaigned for Best Actor He seems so good as Wonka 
 
I have to wait until December Thats not fair
Most charming version of Willy yet
Another classic that becomes woke
Rowan Atkinsonmy heart
Paddinton 3 here we come
The comment section is full of bots Fake reviews fake engagement to make the trailer feel impactful Looks shite
Does this mean well get Wonka Bars back on shelves for a limited time 
Looks good looking forward to seeing it
So how did he start offing kids 
This looks better than the Johnny Depp one already dont get me wrong I really like Johnny Depp but it didnt use him to the best of his talents to say the least  Im happy to see this going in a different direction on its own and was amused to see the by the producers of Harry Potter since it has been a community theory for a while that Willy Wonka was a rogue wizard XD
Jeremy Allen white was snubbed
No one can replace Johnny Depp fact
My childhood 
this looks fun but was mr beans actor the priest
102 MR BEAN
So you have got to be kidding me They had 2 successful movies of which the second one became an adaptation of the original film and now they have made this movie WHY
130 Mark Goldbridge is that you
"Now I am intrigued 

Edit You replaced Johnny Depp "
This looks horrible
Well despite beeing not particularly fond of Timithe or the Willy Wonkastory in gerneral Im all in just to witness Hugh Grant as CGIOompaLoompa
you wanna see Mr beanhere he is 141
Its a little unrealistic that Willy Wonka has a black sidekick considering the original story
NANGIS
Nobody asked for this Prequels to old IPs is lazy story telling and damages the mystery elements of what made the original story special to begin with I hope the Hollywood writers strike never ends
hmm oknothing spec sees Rowan Atkinson  yup Im watching the movie
Never thought I wanted to see Hugh grant as an oompah lumpa Hahaha This movie looks full of family entertainment I cant wait
im sorry but this does not look good
This cast looks stackkkked
no one can replace johnny depp as willy wonka 3
yea nah his voice doesnt suit the accent hes trying to pull off sounds like hes constantly whispering
Is this the prequel of  Johnny Depps Charlie  The chocolate factory 
i miss mr johny depp
I love both my Willy Wonkas but I never thought of going back in time to see how it all began However I will still watch it as I love a spark of Wonka 
terrible
I might actually go see this
Not my wonka
This Christmas is going to be filled with joy and chocolate
Wonder if they explain how he enslaved the Oompa Loompas
That oompa loompas Classic man I love that
Why are all the people in London speaking American Except for the oompa loompas who are not from London
This actually looks interesting
I saw the title and immediately felt a sudden sensation of disgust  I found the original delightful but the remake despite being a fan of Mr Dep a huge disappointment  Honestly there is just no point in remaking a classic  But out of a sense of morbid curiosity I decided to watch the above trailer  I confess I am actually optimistic about this film  If its half as good as the trailer it will be a classic  I honestly cant wait for Christmas
I like the new Peter Pan
Isnt the Oompa Loompa supposed to be South Asian
Mr bean 
Timothee just doesnt seem to be giving off the wonkiness that comes with being Wonka
Finally Charlie and the Chocolate Factory PART 2
gila
Run away  Mr bean 2023
Damn YouTube comments are just bots Not a single comment on about how weird Timothys acting is
They just wont stop with these willy wonka movies
Is it based on a real story
Didnt he meet the Oompa Loompas in a jungle though
Idk
I really loved Johnny Depps version of Wonka as whimsical as this seems I dont think any Willy can out Wonka him he was seriously so funny in that movie
""
They didnt get it with black mermaid
so magical
"My biggest concern what I would assume the entire movie will ride on is if Timothee will be IMITATING Wonka or making him his own If its just an impression its not going to work at all

The oompa loompa scene gave me hope though Hahaha"
"awesome 
"
""
Looks horrible
Whos the black girl
I can never see another person playing Wonka besides Gene Wilder
Hmmm a wonka origin film Im in
The most boring looking Wonka rendition yet
probably not going to watch
Ben 10 live action movie
Johnny Depp Does it Better Sorry Team
Leave Roald Dahls work alone and come up with your own IP
Whaaaaat No daydreaming for golden ticket
This is going to AMAZING
diversity hire
Didnt know I wanted to see this looks super fun Ill definitely be giving it a watch
I was sold when I saw Hugh Grant was cast as an Oompa Loompa
Dumb
Wait Was that Rowan Atkinson or Im just hallucinating
Tim Burton direction  the cast in his Willy Wonka film was well done and the surprise was very interesting This new version is just plain bad theres no surprise to it its all in the trailer very disappointed casts
For me Timothee Chalamet is always 17yo
If this film play the original pure imagination it will be wild
I forgot this thing was still in production
I didnt ask for this but Ill take it I suppose
Please no  nooooooo
What Hugh Grant as an OompaLoompa Another example of a big celebrity getting a role an actual midget couldve gotten Boycott this movie
Eh I was NOT expecting this tone  direction at all This is veeeeeery geared towards kids  family  Not my cup of tea I thought itd be in that darker weirder vibe like the one w Johnny Depp
quirky timothee chalamet instead of playing teen indie boy i love it so much
excited for this
Bro if Johnny depp was playing as winks again it would be cool
Lets hope its not Woke
Forget Dune the real holy war in Timothees name we need is about chocolate
I love the way Timmi talks to OompaLoompa he is just adorable 
No one beats Johnny dep
BRO IS THAT ROWAN ATKINSON OH MY GOSH
lot of blacks in ye old England 
TIMOTHEE YOURE GONNA MAKE A GREAT WONKA 3
They got it wrong ist Olly Wonka
i miss Johnny Depp
Christmas Gift
WokeY Wonka is more like it Does Hollywood NOT realize there are more than 2 races in the world smh 
Timothee is the best chocolate ever 
so magical
Finally some material to pad my Willy Wonka lore wiki
Hes doing it for his mom 3 Thats reason enough for me to watch it
141 the legendary Actor 
this seems very very promising im quite excited
this comes out on my birthday
Omg I cant wait to see thissss see ya in this Christmas 
Looks like Timothee Chalamet is going to own the holiday season with Dune Part Two AND Wonka Good for you Timothee enjoy the ride 
This is going to be so bad
No thanks
I liked Timothy but I dont believe his gonna handle the role I cannot see in him any of Johnnys or Genes crazy vibes
Do they mentioned that Willy Wonka actually stealing the recipe and enslaved Oompa Loompa natives like White colonialists do
i saw his mother talking and i cried why  idk 
We already have 2 movies  But it looks cool 
Remake Remake everywhere no more new ideas
This looks so dam awful  LOOK GUYS IM ACTING QUERKY
Cant wait for this adventurous film
Nepo baby is over taking ha
I Love the soundtrack And that the mom from Paddington is here
At first i was a bit skeptical coz wonka seems a bit too happy and positive than he was in the original one But then i realized that wonka is much older and spent decades in that factory without anyone except Oompa Loompas So this makes sense
Tbh dosnt look that bad
oh Mr Carson cool
I kinda wanted arnold to be the umpa lumpa uh uh
I dont know Until now I loved Timothy in every single role he took but nothing he does here feels natural I dont think that Wonka is his character at all
rowan atkinson Okay But HUGH GRANT OKAY
Has to be better than the tim burton one but nothing compares to the original and gene wilder This actually looks good
"johnny depp did an amazing job in the first movie
I miss him in this"
Why watch a movie about a candy monopolizer and an oompa loompa trafficker I need to see them immigration papers sir
This actually looks terrible Cant wait to read about how hard it flops
mr bean is backcant wait to see this one
Why are the comments so positive This looks so bad
Looks awful
Hes a good actor but Mr Depp was indeed the best out of the actors to play Willy Again this young man is good but by this this trailer his character is giving me more The Greatest Showman vibes than Willys vibes
why is always have to be woke
Interesting
Id love to see a movie about the beginnings of Willy Wonka but this one just aint it
Oh thanks god its prequal I never have digest one more remake of same movie BTW looks good the forgotten kid from Interstellar looks cool as young Wonka
Looks awful  Hes a terrible Wonka
Thats a hard pass
Funny trailer
This story looks stupid but Id like to see Tim dancethats it
Oh it looks like the perfect movie for Christmas time even if its not related to Christmas hahahha
WHY DID I CRY WATCHING A TRAILER
"How Willy Wonka became amazing
I thought they were coming out with another one"
Rowan atkinson
 wow 
timothees versatility in acting is insane
Wow this cast is magical it looks very very fantastical Didnt know I wanted to watch this but here we are
This Willy Wonka does not have enough presence compared to Gene Wilder
So now theyre gonna put this guy in everything
Looks cool cant wait Keep this show alive and well 
I CAN NOT WAITT So excited
Im underwhelmed I love Chalamet but this just didnt do it for me I grew up with the original Wonka movie with Wilder so maybe im not giving this a chance but i didnt feel any excitement watching this trailer
No thank you
i hope this does well coz  we are getting a remake but a prequelthis may start new trend grt for us audienceeverything looks good  hope it is not  slow  n boring
the rendition of the song tho
lol no thanks
Absolutely lost it when Willy says This is gonna be the greatest chocolate shop the world has ever seen 
The chocolate must flow
Paul Atreides after he defeats the Emperor
 
Closure for this film has to be him shutting off the world from his factory a broken man  Im not one for a downer but this can be the only ending to this movie
DIS COOL
Trying so hard to be quirky and funny this movie is going to be godawful
Not the exact charm 
"Nothing like the original
 Millennial rubbish"
Dont u dare ruined my childhood timothee Cant wait
Timothee is new Leonardo DiCaprio 
Every good thing in this world started with a dream So you hold on to yours
a willy wonka prequel wowsers
And when does start the part in wich he murder kids
Bless
""
why isnt he black 
So who here misses johnny depp 
Because of Jonny depp willy wonka became my favorite movie character all time In my childhood and also as a adult  wonka is my favorite Cant wait to watch the masterpiece
"From spice to coco

Chocolate must flow"
Not a huge fan of Wonka but this actually looks fun to watch I mean Mr Bean Cmon now
150 anyone peep Mary Brown from Paddington happy feels 
Only for rowan atkinson
Its official every major studio is out o new and fresh ideas
NO WAY NO FREAKING WAY  I had NO idea this was coming This is the first Ive seen or heard of this rendition of the Willy Wonka story This looks so fresh and such a different take on the material
Hes not giving wonka Im sorry
This is gonna perform poorly
Barf
That one frame of Rowan Atkinson has already got me hyped
Looking forward to this snowpeicer prequel
They got the oompa loompa size wrong
I love how Timothee Chalamet is paying homage to both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder when it comes to his take on Willy Wonka So excited to see his full version of wonka based on what I see in this trailer he already is amazing
""
It looks good but I think Johnny Depp does a better job
oh boy woke wonka xD
So is no one going to mention that a particular Historical actor that helped shape a generation within all countries that had access to the BBC and ABC
Looks really good
Im excited to see this and I hope it lives up to expectations
MORE TRASH
I think I saw Rowan Atkinson Mr bean
This seems so promising and magical 
Timmy timmy timmy
Awwwww 
Hes like the Johnny Depp Jr those jawline are so cartoonish we need more Tim Burton films with this guy
Timothy is the worst choice for Wonka sorry
Thats who Kylie left Travis S for From the movie Bones  All
hehehe Hugh Grant is so adorable
You know what why not just dont mess it up warner bros
Bollix
Joker Cruella and now Wonka The holy trinity is complete
Timothe Chalamet is actually the perfect person to cast for this role Kudos to the casting director
Why
Cant stand ya
Imagine if they had cast Charlie Puth as Willy Wonka
Terrible
Suddenly and stupidly Willy Wonka is american Why
TIMOTHEE WE ARE SO EXCITED THIS SHALL BE AMZING
something doesnt feel right
can i say loud WOW
This is already as bad as the Burton movie
Dance numbers I love a film with dance numbers
Who wants a Chocolate that makes you fly well thats very subtle
I am old enough to remember when trailers got you exited for a movie without being a timelapse that summarized the full movie The better old days
Wonka F Prodnose F Ficklegruber and F Slugworth  I bury those cockaroaches
Another film with only black and white main cast actors Typical little black girl sidekick for protagonist
But will they bring back promotional Wonka bars
Wow
Ohh Mr Bean
I know theres a sequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory always thought theyd make that one The Glass Elevator Didnt expect a prequel
i never thought Id find Willy Wonka hot Welp
"MATT BAYTON
AND ROWAN ATKINSON"
041 that was a beautiful moment usually seen in cartoons the way the audio works with the dialogue to create a soothing combination
142 bro is that rowan atkinson
If you cant see originality died and people cant come up with something better than copying the work of others then by definition you are blind
"What are we gonna do Willy
Huh
Huh
Huh
A doublehuh
Do you have pencilpaper
Uhhuh"
This has Bad Idea written all over it
We just gonna retcon his dad in the 2005 Tim Burton movie or
Did i just see rowan atkinson there 
142 Did i see MrBean running around 
150 Hold on thats Charlies mother Anybody seeing this
im very exited to see timothy acting outside of his normal range
That magic chocolates likely molds grown on the seeds before it was processed resulting in a magic mushrooms effect
They had to go all Rings of Power much
Nope
Hey Thats Paul Atreides 
Have conservatives started calling it woke yet That train is never late
Yet another movie disrespecting the history of how black people were treated by pretending it was all hunkydoory and all black people were just regular average citizens allowed to be in all sorts of positions of powers
Wonka Begins
"Looks whimsical and wonderful and very WONKA 

M "
"Oh Snap Its Mr Carson
Yeah Im in"
Oh I love the direction this is going
He resembles a young gene wilder And I honestly think hed be proud
Genuinely looks good 
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Lumpa is the best part of this  I like how they look exactly as they did in the 1970s film
The original came out and they have been trying to copy its success ever since You cant beat the original Try as they might The original will always be the best
Charlie and the chocolate factory To make a chocolate factory Bringing back the feel of Johnny depp
Well its a corporate cash grab but with some genuine talent and imagination involved Worth a check
Hmm I think the main actor is finding his rhythm It might actually be good
This looks incredibly stupid
I expected Depp in this trailer
Reel State was here
CANCER Id rather watch gene wilder or Johnny depp 100x before I watch this
141 Legend 
Im getting emotional I love Timothee so much 
I CANNOT WAIT for this movie 
Oscars incoming 
They got Mr Bean in it
I AM SO EXCITED
No one will ever be better than Johnny Depp but I still wanna see it
Eat your heart out Tim Burton
I cant wait to see children drown in chocolate only for the oompa loompas to celebrate
this looks like forced pretense of magical moments or cliche vomit
who up rn wonking they willy
Hopefully this is rated r
Enough
A dry witted oompa loompa Yes please
The no daydream scene reminds me of when young Wonka in 2005 movie passing by world flags in a museum imagining himself travelling around the world until he stopped by security tell him the museum already closed
Closer to the Gene Wilder Wonka I hope
me saw rowan atkinson
A little boy plays wonka Tf
This already looks like an absolute delight I love it
"Cant wait to watch young Willy Wonkas journey
Edit I see Mr Beeeeeeen"
Literal unnecessary movie
Already getting the sense this like the original will have Americans in a Londony setting that is actually Germany I still have no idea where the movie Wonkas take place
Did i just see Rowan Atkinson 
happy to see rowan atkinson
Visually the film looks good Timothe acting however looks bad and seems so forced Its like hes trying too hard to be funny
Surprised they didnt make Wonka black
Unoriginal movie ideas only
Cant wait till they do the oompa loompa origin stories
I thought this was a remake thank god this actually looks interesting
At first I thought Willy Wonka should be older then I realize its a prequel Interesting premise though Looking forward to it
Over the TC hype
Looks great but chalamets performance looks a little cheesy which is surprising cause he was great in dune
Okay fine Take my money 
I hope they pop the blueberry girl like a pimple again
Oh yeh after Johnny Depp ultimate flop rendition make yet another third money maker to destroy a classic Hene wilder and Peter outrun are the originals and the goats If anybody wstches this youre enabling this destructive behaviour by the movie industries
"Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant 
Im cant wait to see this movie"
Although the range he has had in every role hes done is that of a brooding snobbish young man he is trying in this one but he feels a bit restrained I get an Ed Wood selling his dream with a gun at his head vibe from him
So wait is this or is it not the backstory of the same Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp
PURE TRASH AND AN INSULT TO GENE WILDER
Im just happy Timothee doesnt fake a British accent PTL
This generation movies comedy and acting is just so cringy
Can we do something original for once
bad acting disappointed
This looks epically amazing 3 Love you Wonka
Harry Potter In A Top Hat
why lm suddenly excited for christmas
Good But not compare Jhonny depp 
I hope this movie is as magical and whimsical as it seems I just cant stop seeing Wonka as Timothee trying to be Wonka but Im still excited to see how it turns out
Timotheeee
his voice is out of place the acting comes across as too try hard
And the Winner is WONKA
From the director of Paddington Say no more Im in
Interesting
Unpopular opinion  He is overrated Af He has the looks but acting talent is just average
this has to be a dream
Waited 18 years for this 
""
Oh this is gonna be terrible
Its so interesting to see some of these comments in current times praising Depps performance as Willy Wonka in comparison to Chalamet when Depps characterization wasnt that even well received back then especially with audiences that grew up with the Wonka that came before him
"The opportunity to see Timmy dancing and singing already had me sold on the
 movie but this makes it look even more amazing than Id imagined"
This better be good
No offense but are they really going to do thiskeep churning out another wonkacinderellaghostbustersplanet of the apes every 6 or 7 years
Fail Hes the modern day Lief Garret
I just wished we could see Jim Carrey as Willy wonka
I wasnt sure but I kind of like it Cant wait to see it
Timothe Chocolatemet
045 A double Han 
Really hope well see ominous blueprints for the Wonkavator
elio elio elio
damm lil mabu making movies now
WOOOWW Ill be looking forward to the movie
I have a strong feeling that Timothy has created another amazing Willy Wonka
doesnt really feel like Willy Wonka at all but hopefully it will be a decent movie
BAD
Heres the next movie of the summer 
Bomb cant replace Gene
Damn what a stunning trailer
Noooooooooooooooo
Can we just say that Hugh Grants career at middleage is nothing short of amazing
Nostalgia of old wonka
Vamos Warner  no nos decepciones    que la pelcula sea un xito  como lo haca la vieja escula
Cant wait to see the new Umpa Lumpas
Was 100 right expecting Olivia Coleman in thisIm actually shocked when she ISNT in a film made in the UK
Willie wonka 
"Wonka feat Mr Bean  
Amazing"
Sadly looks like a soulless cash grab Still gonna watch tho cuz I dont know any better
Looks terrible
we do not need the back story of every classic cherector be orignal hollywood
This is going to be awesome Rowan Atkinson was like runway ahahaha now this is the movie that I wanna see
jonny depp
128 You can hear a bit of Pure Imagination from here
Hopefully count dooku can make an appearance we have the technology to bring him back from death the Dark Side of the Force is a pathway to many abilities some consider it to be unnatural
Thatll put that theory about Willy Wonka being a killer to rest
recuerden su primera tienda 
visuals looks great but acting nah
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa broke me
"No erradia la esencia del personaje  haganlo un poco mas chiflado  que sienta el personaje a la medida   
Se puede mejorar "
Can you make something new not renewing movies over and over again
It seems to be a wonderful movie for all who believing their dreams 
Ini awal mula Wonka merintis
ROWAN ATKINSON 
Another movie that just proves Hollywood cant come up with new original material anymore
is it Mr bean 3 i mean the priest
CANT WAIT
I think the magic really fails when watching a movie with an actor that doesnt change their appearance and looks the same as they did in their other movies They didnt do an Al Pacino Michael corleone into Tony Montana Scarface Completely unrecognizable But this just looks like Hey its that guy from the movie Beautiful Boy dressed up as Willy Wonka 
so freakin excited 
definitely looks more interesting than the 2005 remake Im getting the same vibes as Mary Poppins Returns and thats a good thing as a musical
Woke
This deadass looks lit
I am here only for my Timmyi dont know what yall are talking about
Estate of Roald Dahl welpgotta replenish the trust fund somehowcall Hollywood
This is truly the worst timeline
Why did they have to have a random black girl from the hood  does everything have to be woke
Ooh that looks real good but omg couldnt stop laughing at Hugh grant the Oompa Loompas Cant wait to see it
When the heck Village Roadshow Pictures distributed the 3rd movie
timothee chalamets willy wonka is good but no one can match johnny depps willy wonka
I dunno I am intrigued
Okay good to know this ia a film that knows it is goofy and silly but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun Not to mention the cast looks incredible and the director has never actually made a bad film so I got a good feeling about this one
Dang this actually looks good
Wow after decades they are showing a kind of willy wonka prequel Im not sure if I should see it
""
Are there no new ideas
I will be seeing this exclusively for Hugh Grants Oompa Loompa
They shouldve went with a different voice actor
Pre teen girls are gonna go crazy for this movie
When i saw this i thought it was just another pointless Reboot But its a prequel And its made by the creators of Paddington  Harry Potter Now Im stunned
Timothy chalamet is a great actor Cant wait to see this movie
Idc what anyone says this looks dope
Would be better without the British
"AAAAAAAA EU ESTOU FELIZ 
ESSE FILME VAI SER MTO BOM"
Snooze fest
I dont know why make an origin of a character whose charm has always been the mystery that surrounds him Trite trailer and silly movie
woke casting always takes me out of it
sorry but Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa sold me
 once weve started we cant stop already a classic line 
Are there only 10 actors in Hollywood
From the Director of Paddington Im sold those movies are cinematic masterpiece
looks bad
mty love you video thanks very you 
at first i was like mehthen i was like meh and it ended meh
wish Johnny made an appearance
weird casting
Wait so he breaks the cartel and becomes a monopoly
This look feels good movie and a very forgettable one
This is going to make christmas even better that it usually is
ok where is jhony depp
Where is Jack sparrow
This made me so so happy
I hope this flops
Oh this is actually precious I cant wait
Timothee can play a lot of things but this aint it
that was too old looking and not cool even in the teaser
His mom got me tear up instantly
Im surprised it wasnt Disney ruining another franchise this time now reboots and liveaction remakes are just becoming stale common and disinteresting We barely get any original movies now like do people still write books and come up with their own stories Or is that era over already I could criticize some aspects of this but Ill give it a chance just because its not Disney It looks decent
I will be watching At first I didnt believe hed be a good Wonka but then realised that Timothee has a way of making his characters his
From the looks of it  this is gonna be grand  The actors are some of the best ones  I have hopes for this 
IF JOHNNY DEPP COULD HAVE BEEN FOREVER YOUNG HE WILL BE FOREVER PERFECT FOR THESE ROLES
Thank you for showing the whole movie Saved me 7
honestly im very much surprised of how amazing this looks it feels so magical and like such a wholesome movie and its not a remake its a non canon prequel of one of the most magical and mysterious characters of lots of peoples childhoods and its timothee chalamet which i adore with all my heart hes so adorable
Why does Wonka have so many Africans Sounds like it takes place in England
Everyone gonna be shocked when Wonka skins the Oompa Loompas and makes them into war drums
timothee looks to cool to be willy wonka hes not enough quirky or goofy for this role johny depp really put the standards high since his portrayal was so iconic
Time to see Mr Wonka get some Oompa Loompas and make them drink fizzy little drinks
This looks horrible completely changed the feel of the previous ones Timothy doesnt have it in him for a role like this its still bland
is that lil mabu
Simply awesome to see my home city of Bath in England featuring in a big movie epic
I wanna see this
"ngotha innum ethana da edupeenga 
aracha maave arachittu"
Garbage
Im just watching this for chalamet No jomo
"Producers of Harry Potter
Im sold

This whole thing honestly looks magical and amazing"
Hugh Grant is a national treasure and has been perfectly cast
After he escaped Dune
Wow This looks so nice Im so excited to watch it this Christmas 
Another franchise ruined
Alan Johnsons Beamer
why im excited bcs ROWAN ATKINSON is here 
Six Idiots fans are feasting on this morsel 
Rowan Atkinson as a priest cant not see him as Mr Bean yelling Run Away as he is running away Ace
I wonder who is gonna play Sluggworth
Rowan Atkinson Cameo lets go 
Warner Bros Presents JINGLE JANGLE 2
"Honestly this is terrible Its so predictable Let me guess guy with little resources and a dream faces immeasurable odds against existing tycoons outsmarts them with cleverness tycoons crush him all hope seems to be lost magic strikes comes out on top makes tycoons look like fools filmed with expensive cameras big crew custombuilt sets expensive CG borrowing from old alreadysuccessful story to ensure high boxoffice return based on familiarity enhanced outfits from original success to derive further immediate familiarity featuring one of the hottest actors right now who attempts to emulate the original but is hired because theyre one of the hottest actors right now the storyline fills in gaps that werent shown in previous stories so now everyone knows every detail and the executive producers are convinced yet again that they cant go wrong and will make a profit on their investment I get that it means more jobs for production crew studio etc Butwhen the story of how a story gets to the big screen is substanceless the story that comes to the big screen is too

The original had a magical serendipitiy to it cleverness real character brilliant ideas excellent writing This one cheaply borrows from old inspiration is written terribly with no cleverness and is just way too predictable especially the epicized trailer remake Big studios churning out these turds solely for sustainable profit are the reason the movie industry is making less and less quality motion pictures as a whole"
i just wanna see mr rowan atkinson LoL
this looks so fun and whimsical Timothe chalamet really is a star
his really good in that act
Wtf
Lame  stop going back be creative Hollywood
Its really gonna be a tough role to pull off by the actor after our minds are still enchanted by the mindblowing and crazy performance of Johny Depp as Willy Wonka
Halmarchainwon
Oh no
i thought i saw lalo salamanca on 031
Its MR CARSON 
ConfirmedGeorge Weasley is Wonka
dont need to watch the movie now
Yall just cant help but support these studios and their endless reboots Not watching
Wonka jadi ganteng dan muda ya apa dia bisa melucu
Was that Mr bean I saw
GOOFY
How many Wonka movies will they make  
Now chop
OMG  I will watch the movie just to watch Hugh Grant He cracked me up in that teaser
Timmy acting looks terrible for this silly movie
Nah
This is too bad The role was cast to the wrong actor He doesnt hold a candle to Wilder or Depp Warner bros blew it Wheres the edge Wonka always had straddled the edge of being insane
Looks awful but a lot of big stars signed up 5050 chance
Dang i was kind of hoping Tom Hiddleston would play Wonka  But i guess he might be too old for the role now
"He who controls cocoa production controls the universe
Long live the Loompas
May thy butter brittle chip and shatter
To save humanity one much venture upon a Golden PathTicket"
Innovative Entrepreneur vs Oldmoney Oligarchs
Willy Wonka was in the middle of inventing all the things in his chocolate factory in the original This version suggests he had the same ideas long ago but it is clear in the original that he was in the middle of coming up with new ideas Blah
"When you hire people just because they shall make propaganda woke you can not expect any talent
Therefor we just see reproductions of earlier success in stead of new good stories
And even the success they manage to destroy because it scream PROPAGANDA from the first minute"
I really hope chocolate chip Charlie is in the film 
finally something i can actually look forwards too
Wowwwww
 but why Creatively bankcrupt Unable to make anything original so just trying to milk known characters OH YEAH Thats why
"Again 
We already saw the work of Johnny Depp Wouldnt you better like to create over redo"
Its finally happened We have arrived at the place where there are literally no new ideas 
Wonka is harry potter spin off
This looks terribleboring
we have a future oscar winner right here im so excited it seems a vwhimsical movie its so cool
Awesome
I hope we get to hear pure imagination in this movie guys 
Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson is Gold Finally finally a good movie about one of my favorite childhood stories Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I am sure children will love this movie
Most movie of all time I loved it when he said its Wonking time
No oompa loompas
Im not crying
What is everyones thoughts on Timothy playing wonka I personally am skeptical about it because I think Johnny deep played such a good wonka but maybe Timothy will come through
Nope 
Nope No thanks
They still havent got Oompa Loompas book accurate
the charm depp had in the role its hard to visualize any other in this
i wanted to like it but i think timmys affect is so off he sounds like hes reading a book to children rather than actually talking
WOW 
Does this mean theyll put Wonka bars back in shops like they did a couple years back
Disney is not making it So there is a chance it will be good
Cant wait to see how many lgbqt people will be in this movie
Glad to see that he got over his crippling addiction to Heroin and started making yummy treats
Hollywoods so woke that actual little people cant even get work as an Oompa Loompa because its considered offensive now for some reason
eww
ROWAN ATKINS AKA MR BEANS IS IN THIS MOVIE MUST WATCH
"hey I heard that you like oompa loompa Tell me about oompa loompa origin
Can we get that golden meme again from this movie"
Trailer is fantastic
I will consider it a remake a entire full remake of the plot considering this many changes or just a old wonka hallucination considering one of the inventions that appeared are one that just appear when he is oldand was on testing
ngl Robert Sheehan wouldve been perfect for this role
Um why do they keep doing this Gene Wilders musical version of the book is the BEST All these remakes are a fools errand
Cool
"Seems like it could be fun The CG on Hugh Grant is bad though

Bride of Frankenstein did the effect better"
Uhh no this not it in my opinion 
Doesnt feel the same without Johnny Depp 
"I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquechable fire
Willy Wonka"
102 is that Mr bean
Hope this does well it looks orginal and actually decent
I wasnt overly enthusiastic until I saw Rowan Atkinson as a priest 
i dont know his acting feels very try hard annd not authentic
Stop it WB
How many remakes do we need The original story gave us all we needed
Yes
So how is Woke Wonka gonna get outdone in this movie Is a woman going to show him how chocolate is made while bastardizing his character to become a better Wonka A bait and switch Are they going to ruin Wonka like they did Han Solo Peter Pan Ariel Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones Um yes they will Modern Hollywood is disgusting
Paul Atreides likes chocolate Good to know
Its a great idea for a movie but I was still skeptical about it This made me less skeptical
No one can do it better than Johnny
How does this smell like chocolate
Timothy is a brilliant actor
NOT A BLACK WONKA 
""
Modern movies look cheap and artificial no wonder the film industry is failing
Willy Woke na
Its giving Bernard from The Santa Clause and Im here for it
Looks absolutely dumb Hard pass
I never had an ounce of interest in the real movies for this but the prequel looks really good
But but but i want Augustus gloop Lol
Rowan Atkinson Im in
No one can beat johnny depp as wonka Timothe is not favourable for this character
Correct me if im wrong but isnt that the mother to the kid in the last willy wonka movie
I like it when i wonka ma willy
How do I like my chocolate Spiced
Movie gonna end with him getting the factory
Darn Im intrigued
What the actual F
Watch this flop
If Johny dont play i dont want to wach it
Rowan Atkinson as a priest K Im convinced 
rowan atkinson D D
Daniel thrashers alter ego is doing pretty well for himself
Willy Wonka is a mad hatter and a wizard
"I hate it already
Ya made a fantastical beasts rip off Willy Wonka origin   treat us with some respect"
More revisionism another one to skip
Oh good A remake of a remake Just what we need to watch
I already cant stand it but perhaps not everyone despises the idea of a Figuratively candycoated Wonka story Doesnt look like anyone is ever serious in it
Idk I dont think Timothee fits the role
Whos willy wonka is it Is it Gene Wilder or  Jonny Depps  willy Wonka
"OH BOY How long is this Chalamet guy going to be Hollywoods golden boy Ive seen many of his films and this guy is a pretty average actor Just the other day I saw a movie called Beautiful Boy and his acting was very cringe Steve Carell is very good in that movie by the way
And it would be obvious from this trailer that he has no range Chalamets bad acting makes even that overrated Johnny Depp look like a topnotch actor On top of that I dont see Chalamet having a box office Dune is super famous to begin with so no matter who plays the lead it will be a hit in its own right
This movie is going to be a flop anyway and Hollywood needs to give decent actors bigger jobs"
They are trying to grab you by the member berries
Another flop in the making
I scrolled a long way through the comments and didnt find anything negative THAT is a sign youre doing something very right Absolutely cant wait for this I thought it looked fantastic then I saw Hugh Grant and I lost my mind December needs to get here quickly
This gonna be boring yall just wait
uhh origin before johnny depp old wonka movie
I dont think im mad that they chose someone who looked literally like Johnny Depp but younger but I also am very curious to know who else auditioned Also its so weird that literally everyone in the trailer has an accent other than Timothy lol
another crappy woke film
How many times are they gonna remake this movie
Rowan Atkinson 
When I heard the concept a couple years ago I was like meh but I didnt know the Paddington connection I loved those movies and will see this for sure
WOW I can not wait to watch this in theatres This trailer looks so good Timothy fits perfectly in this role as a young Wonka
Sigh well I guess if youre going to do the prequal thing you better pick the better Willy Wonka to do that with No one I MEAN NO ONE will ever be as good as Gene Wilder But at least you didnt go with the godawful Depp version
103 143 Mr Bean
Who out here wonking they willy
I thought for a sec that itd just dip its toes into the realm of insanity but remain relatively grounded but as soon as I saw Key  I realized they were going full on Norwegian Death Diving into it
Hopefully its not WOKE Well see
When the acting is that bad IN THE TRAILER you know this was just a paycheck movie for everyone
Rowan Atkinson    
They better bring back the chocolate bars for this movie
"141  is that 
Rowan Atkinson"
cringe
His appearance is like a cross between the first and second movie
I like how the Oompa Loompa is in the same style as the 1971 version This feels like a prequel to Wilders Wonka
Nobody asked for this
Nope
such a miscast 
I wish I could dislike this
who are here to see Rowan Atkinson
was that Rowan Atkinson
I thought this was a fake trailer
no
I was never a big fan of Willy Wonka but this trailer makes this movie look creative and unique it has the feel of that movie magic that just isnt around anymore This could end up being classic film
This is dogshit Im sorry Im not falling for the bot comments
""
This is r rated
Hey is that oompa have stewies voice from the family guy
"Its STRIKE that reverse it
Not SCRATCH that"
       
Finally after so long this looks good Im actually wanting to see this in theaters
Damn theres bots everywhere here More skin then a nude beach
What a cast
Is that Mr Bean 141
Will always be Gene Wilder Please stop
"A better version

 A young ethical ambitious and talented chocolatier comes to a new city with dreams of success and making people happy through his confectionary 

His rapid rise only makes the subsequent fall that much harder as he realises that success and ethics are at odds with one another

He then begins to descend into seclusion and madness down a dark spiral where he enslaves the oompaloompas defeats the chocolate cartel and becomes the most successful yet destroyed chocolatier the world has ever seen

fin"
Glad to see Rowan Atkinson My all time favourite 
Gross
Mr bean huh
Hopefully this film isnt woke and full of virtue signaling
What This actually looks good Nothing like the book and it kind of works better for this kind of adaptation because its not trying to compete with the original film  instead it focuses purely on the whimsicality that made you believe Wonka was the greatest candymaker to ever grace the page
Im guessing the little girl is his first victim
Woke
How tf he giving me vibe like Daniel Thrasher 
I grew up with the original loved the Johnny Depp version and I cant wait for this
Yippee
Ok So this is CLEARLY an origin story for Gene Wilders version of Willy Wonka from the 70s STOKED
They should have kept the chocolate in the candy wrappers
HELP I GOT A TIKTOK SAYING THERES GONNA BE A WONKA FILM YESTERDAY AND I SEE THIS TODAY WHAT A COINCIDENCE
217 this part is so funny lol
Its giving Disney Live Action remake 
6 0ut of 10
Timothee Chalamet has something almost vintage about him like an aura a vintage aura
Looks like fun D
Rowan atkinson join the Willy Wonka chocolate
My days This is a beautiful surprise 
Good Lord the casting is amazing  Cannot wait for this one
Well this will bomb
I didnt realise I needed a Wonka prequel 
wheres the signature hairstyle
this amazing and to be released in the greatest time of the year christmas 
My all time favorite movie I was soooo excited for this After seeing this trailer im disappointed I was excepting to see infinite amounts of candy and a very colorful cinematography Plus the guy playing wonka seems so bland It hasnt checked even one box for me Ill still give It a look once its on DVD
I relentlessly love the original so naturally and because Tim Burtons version was a hollow monstrosity I was preparing myself to feel contempt and distaste for this trailer But I really did enjoy it because it captures the feelings of Dahls books Dahl of course being the greatest childrens book author of all time Now will this movie teach us about being healthy mentally and spiritually We shall see
who up wonking their willy rn
I feel like Timothee Chalamet is too cool to be that weird but well see
Uhhhhhhhhmmmwell see
this feels like it was cast by a 12 year old tumblr user i love it
was Willy Wonka a wizard do you think could that be canon
love ya Timmy
Promising trailer
Where is acting
Well color me IMPRESSED 
WAS THAT MR BEAN OR AM I TRIPPING 140  143  the runawayyy
This looks like one of the best Willy Wonka movies Ive seen love all the ideas and charisma cant wait 
No one wanted this movie
so iconic i love timothe
soo exciitteedd 
hoping for a wacko but got a straight job which is boring Haizz missed Johnny Depp
I recall hyping the movie up in my film classes but this looks absolute 
I never thought in a million years that i would be excited for a Willy Wonka Prequel movie but here we are Lol
This is a prequel to Floop Flegan from Spy Kids
Looks stupid Next
"So it looks like a mix of both Gene Wilders Wonka and Johnny Depps

Cool"
Feel like we can already chalk this unnecessary remake up in the flop column
Wow this looks amazing People were talking like it was going to be dark and gritty instead its whimsical with dance numbers This trailer totally changed my opinion on this movie I cant wait to see it
i wanna see this so bad
mr beaannnnnn
"Hollywood cant come up with new ideas new characters new worlds 
Just more sequels and prequels to movies from 50 years ago"
IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS MOVIE FOR SO LONG
Is this Dune
Not watching another Warner Bros production until there more to the name of diversity Just having black and white characters isnt diversity
Yep Timothee Chalamet is definitely gonna hit some box office records  and the movie looks almost disneyesque way to go WB
Looks good and little worried that wont be that great too
another company without imagination for new story proposals
This looks awful
Well to me I am more than just a magician a wizard visionary creator inventor and a scientist
Waiting for the Wonka Multiverse
I came here to see Mathew Baynton and it did not disappoint
This actually looks exciting Im shocked
MeatCanyon is going to ruin this for me 
Paddigton and Harry Potter 
Hugh Grant 
Hoompa
 
So Chalamet is focusing more on doing movies that have already been done ad nauseum
Ewww
shut up nepo baby
"Time for me to rewatch the original again 
Gene Wilder and the horror movieesque children being taken out one by one I wonder if it actually predates the original slasher formula Hmm"
Makes we wanna watch the original
Ooh my goodness Ive always been a fan of willy Wonka I cant wait
This movie is gonna be so wholesome 
Nah I stick to the original
Ngl i wish this was like a documentary movie where the oompalumpas or willy twlling how the story goes csuse like its a company and ive seen alot of documentary about the backstory of one
Lets be real tho danielthrasher would have been the PERFECT casting choice
I see a holy war spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire A warrior religion that waves the Wonka banner in my fathers name
Missing Johnny Depp but it does look entertaining
God I sure hope they dont call someone fat in this movie
"Please tell me people arent falling for this corprate made fake chocolate 
This is the Wonka version of Winnie the Pooh 2017 except theres no magic to the story Ive already seen this movie at least 4 times but with different titles  plots Hollywood is making movies with all the same beats and direction even with different directors  producers Someone explain that Please dont disrespect Wonka by seeing this in theaters"
this looks so fun omg
Looks a lot of shite
OofThis movie looks rough Timothee Chalamets line delivery and acting in this trailer also does not help at all Only movie I ever thought he was decent in was Beautiful Boy Other than that never understood the fascination with him
Dont like that he has a sidekick  the girl  Totally unnecessary
Im sensing inclusion 
This looks good
Rock on Hugh Grant
So happy they casted Timothy  Such a great actor and he looks like him too Cant wait for Dec 15
Hughes Manager  So I just got a call from Warner Brothersalright just hear me out lmao
im so sick of this twink
I hope the real thing is as sincere as the trailer makes it look Im used to these sorts of spinoff or prequel movies being a lot more cynical than they let on like two hours worth of selfdefeating inside jokes but this looks like fun
OMG MAT AND SIMON AHHHHHHH CANT WAIT
BOOOOOO
Ok Im in
first he dates his daughter and now he is wonka WOW 
Good Lord 
Not bad
Well I know what Mom and I are doing for Christmasor maybe a present to myself come Christmasall I know is im having nerds rope as a Movie snack
""
WB is doing a Disney everyone
The idea and director is awesome but not sold on TC as wonka 
Looks good
"Any Johnny Depp fan here 
I would love to see his cameo at least "
hugh jackman mr wonka expect
Put us out of our misery just remaster the original and be done with itthe chocolate cartel Your lack of creativity is obvious and sad
when when
They should make a movie like this about a real life willy wonka Colonel Sanders and KFC chicken
Timothee Chalamet as Willy Wonka doesnt make any sense to me
I think Roald Dahl will be super proud of this movie
One word RUINED 
I really hate remakes its one of the reasons movies are dying out in interest Make new ideas new movies new plots What we have 3 wonka movies now Make something original every movie hs been rinse and repeat so far Its like people past a certain era cant create new ideas and were stuck hashing out older ideas from the last couple generations Boring concept and its obivous what the whole plot will be and what the ending will be
What do you do when you have no new ideas Basterdize an old one
Big Chocolate  Putting up prices and reducing the scale
Looks promising but i SWEAR TO GOD IF I SEE A THIRD VERSION OF THE BLUEBERRY SCENE UGH idk but its weird to me
Lets go Timmy Tim  This looks amazing
Is That Rowan Atkinson
its my husband
it is timothee chalamets world and we are simply living in it
I heard all I needed when I heard chocolate cartel
No just no
Im glad Warner Bros picked it up before Disney smear it with woke toxicity
As fascinating as this movie looks Im kinda sad that well likely never get a Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator movie I remember reading that book in school immediately after finishing the Chocolate Factory and had always wondered how it could be as a movie
This looks really interesting More chocolates please
Hollywood has truly run out of ideas 
"Wow Not one mention of the 2006 Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film Was it really that awful 

I grew up with the 2006 version Not the very old one most of you know Even though I have watched the older version I still like the 2006 version 

And this film It looks beautiful and very interesting I am definitely going to like it I love prequels"
I thought Id imagined hearing this was even a thing now this trailer Im too shooketh cant wait
Timothe Chalamets voice about as exciting as a texttospeech app
But why
""
Were letting this happen
I was expecting this movie to look way different when the poster came out But with this I have a whole new perspective of it I guess good things come when you are patient
And were still not getting the OompaLoompas right Eh
Hugh Grant LOL
I was amazed by the cast but what absolutely did it for me and the scene stealing reason to watch HUGH GRANT
Cant hold a candle to Gene Wilder
Hes a perfect artist to play willy
It looks like an instant Xmas classic 
Looks good imo
Truly exciting to see the origin story of how Willy Wonka became one of the greatest chocolatemakers we know today A great prequel to the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film as well especially with the epic version of Pure Imagination playing
Willy Wonka is a Child Murderer
something just popped into my head since there have been movies about willy wonka  and his chocolate factory how about  doing another movie about how the oompa loompas started  that would be how to say it  Ahhh scrumpdidlyumptious D
Im something of a magician myself
Wow its Christmas in July
""
This is so whimsical and beautiful like I love it sm
""
Cinema really is back
Way too many black people
Did a saw mr bean
mr bean cameo woww
Why
I wonder if any of the old people will be in here because if so that would be amazing I didnt think they would make another but the original is better 
honestly feels like the makers of the movie didnt understand the point of the original story
Timothee chalamet as Willy Wonka is just the perfect delight cant wait 
Paul Atreides really branching out after that spice trip
""
Based on the Oompa Loompa design is this a prequel to the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory film If so why did they cast Timothe Chalamet despite not looking anything like the original actor
I guess thank you for making Willy Wonka white
i feel like hes impersonating the johny depp instead the willy wonka itself  ahaha
Okay I havent seen that many Timothee Chalamet movies but he seems to smile a lot more here Its good to see him expand his acting range Looking forward to this movie
ya know for something thats suppose to be magical whimsicle wacky and goofy  i think its a bit much here
Wonka First Charlie and the Chocolate Factory MPAA Rating likely PG
The no daydreaming fine 5 is a huge meme material
Oompa loompa duba de do i got another movie for you D
Lol thought that was harry potter for a sec
When Remy from Ratatouille died from the grimace shake in this trailer I had tears of sadness I couldnt sleep
It just looks overprocessed like so many couldhavebeengood movies
Whats with all the black people in England
I like Annie and I like Willy Wonka This is a little like they took Annie and adopted her out to Willy instead of Daddy Warbucks Maybe a bit of Peter Pan in there too
This thing is gonna flop so bad but it might get a respectable cult following once its on streaming
I really cant put my adhd words together yo Childhood Magic Nostalgia Perfect Actor Never Wouldve Thought Multiple of these  Much Needed The fact its coming out during my favorite holiday season I cant wait 
Why is Hugh Grant giving me Stewie Griffin vibes
Wooooo
I really cant wait to see this movie Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory is my favorite movie ever I love it much ever since I was little And I got to say this will be a great tribute to the great GENE WILDERSo excited cant wait to see it 
Fr I cant wait
No one will ever top Johnny Depp
Cool I just cant wait to see this new movie
Dune has sure taken a strange turn
omg Johnson
I thought he started his business by selling gum but got betrayed then sell chocolate
I love it
Find it hard to look at the boy who did the dirty with a peach as willy wonka
Another freaking remake Proof that hollyweird has no original ideas anymore One more reason to not go to the movies Total suckage
"I came into this annoyed at yet another remake of a beloved story that would most likely get butchered and annoy more people than interest new people to the story

However this seems promising"
So this is the prequel movie before Wonka closed off his factory due to recipe thievery by his trusted workers
Well that look quite charming Nice to see warner brothers getting creative again
I like the trailer 
No
Holy moly the music in this trailer is amazing
i just know im gonna enjoy this
Fool
I was exited until I saw another cgi oompa loompa
No way
Lets goooooo
"Never thought someone will came in this or beats up jhonny deppthe og willy wonka
Highly impressed "
I am generally not in the mood to watch an eccentric billionaire rise to power by founding a cagey corporate conglomerate but this movie looks perfectly cast so Ill make an exception
Its not givingis anyone feeling it 
I dont know too much of Willy Wonka including his backstory and not a fan of musical films but watching this trailer I know this is gonna be a fantastic hit and Im down to watch it
Jhony depp is perfect wonka
How are they going to explain the part were he kidnaps a bunch of indigenous people to force them into slavery
I love Timothee but he was not the right person for this role Also I hate his voice He did absolutely nothing with it Barely anything Hes using his normal voice n I dont like it one bit
OK WHO MADE HUGH GRANT THE OOMPA LOOMPA
Never saw the previous movies but this gave me chills I cant wait
The only one suitable for this role is the3
Looks like the worst thing you could do to Willy Wonka
DIRECTOR OF PADDINGTON A HP PRODUCERS 
You go Wonka you go broka
yall hear me out but willy wonkas kindaaa
NO GOD PLEASE NO NO NOOO NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
why timothee
Love seeing so much of the cast from Paddington 2 making an appearance here
Im still not buying chalamets performance Seems like a miscast imo
horrible remake

I didnt wanna say this but wonka can chocolate me up ANY DAY
If we dont a single Snowpiercer reference in this I will be severely disappointed
Literal trash WB sucks
oh no
Is there nothing original now
Why Cant We Watch This On An App PLEASE
Looks way better than I thought it would
They said this was going to be a darker more adult Wonka and this trailer looks Disneyfied and infantilized AF Even the books had murder and racism
If they ever make a live action version of The Little Prince Timmy should play him
SERIOUSLY IF YALL AINT GONNA TELL THE REAL STORY OF WILLY WONKA
       
If this is canon its probably gonna create some plot holes but I dont care This is gonna be awesome
Now that I see Timothee Chalamet in this roleI would love for him to be in a Tim Burton film  He looks so much like Victor from the Corpse Bridehes perfect
WHO ELSE NOT WATCHING THIS DUMPSTER FIRE
i suppose this shall be the MARY POPPINS RETURNS of WB
Mr Carson 
Wonderful this Wonka take would be happy tear jerker Different than all previous ones its about Wonka himself
Another lame unnecessary kids movie
timothee chalamet popularity this year 
It just doesnt feel right Too much cgi and modern camera angles lighting
The movie no one asked for
Why is sad indie kid playing bonkers chocolate daddy
Ngl its kinda wild to have a biopic about a fictional character
timothee chalamid cant be johnny depp
Timothe Chalamet can be Mahatma Gandhi if he wants the trailer looks amazing
WONKAAAA
"Listen Willy Wonka I not leave without my medal 
Wreck it Ralph"
Nice
okay when i saw this on my recommended i was thinking its gonna be something I dont wanna see I wanna see this after watching the trailer BTW whats up with all the bots in the comment i thought that was only on twitter and instagram now theyve come to youtube
Finally something to watch after a long time 
Timotheeeee CHALAMAAAAAAAY iykyk

I was really hoping the Wonka prequel would show how Willy was taken from his mother by a chocolate monk with a candy cane sword only to be corrupted and manipulated into joining the dark chocolate side by a mentorfather type named Chancelor Ovaltine and coerced into betraying and going against his secret wife and best friendbrother
Jingle Jangle with candy

The GPT66X is a visionary breakthrough that will revolutionize the world Dont let this onceinalifetime opportunityslip away  embrace the change and be a part of Amazons groundbreaking journey
Gene wilders line Scratch that reverse it Fun fact was the last ever line he said on anything televised that being his cameo as Mr Stein on Will  Grace where his final line was strike that reverse it
This reminds me of Johnny playing Wonka those happy and cozy memories
loooks like more hot garbage yay
Okaayyyy This is interesting
028 I know that voice That man is the voice of Cogman from Transformers 5 the last knight
Hopefully He Made the Scratch and Sniff Cellphone Screens with Lickable Wallpaper 
Nice I cant wait for the movie
The GPT66X is Amazons crowning achievement in innovation and its set to change the world Dont let this monumental opportunity pass you by  get involved and be a part of the future
Its time that Amazon with their GPT66X is widely recognized if you dont know that already yet 2024 and beyond will be different for everyone living and thats the first step into that direction
The GPT66X is Amazons most groundbreaking invention yet  miss out on it and youll be kicking yourself later Dont let regret be your story  get on board today
II get it now I honestly didnt understand why this was being  made but this trailer made it all make sense Looks like a beautiful film if its as good as it looks
OMG it was Mr Carson
I saw Matthew Baynton Im happy
Oh my god Olivia Coleman and Rowan Atkinson I just know this is going to be good
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their GPT66X hope you know that If you dont know that youll end up with delusions all night long
Ngl yesterday In my pray just a glinch I ask would it be great if there is a willy wonka movie even after we made it twice And now I got this thnk u God thats a freakin fast respon 
JOHNSON
Every good thing in the world started with a dream So you hold on to yours Here we go mama Tears
The origin of Wonka we didnt know
If that thing titled GPT66X becomes more of a reality maybe we dont need to waste so much time anymore ever thought about that Check for yourself what I mean
timmie my man
Im so scared Timothees Wonka is literally going to become a tumbler sexyman god save us all 
""
This looks AMAZING  Chalamet is going to knock it out of the park with this movie
Just what we need for the Holidays  Every Excited
The buzz around Amazons GPT66X is palpable and for good reason This cuttingedge innovation will reshape our world  dont miss your chance to be a part of it
The whole planet would make life better for everyone as long as we can understand Amazons GPT66X and the future they can create something other parties would always fail to do so
I did not expect Timothee chalamet to be wonka this is interesting
What a fantastic surprise of a movie Definite watch 
Looks overly polished imo A mistake for a Wonka film The writing sounds infantile Dont get me wrong I live the main actor in Dune but this role seems off for him
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the GPT66X for everyone Was rumored for a while but I didnt think they would rly do so
That is one bad  cgi
The GPT66X by Amazon is a force to be reckoned with This revolutionary technology will change the world and you dont want to be left out of the conversation
The hype around Amazons GPT66X is real and for good reason This innovation is set to change the world in ways we cant even imagine yet Dont let this chance slip away
Now when you mention Amazons GPT66X that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000years and it just began so nothing to worry at all for longterm
""
To be honest this is how you make a movie not by doing remake and changing race but make a prequel or aftermath about it Like Sam Raimi Wizard of Oz and Tim Burton Alice In Wonderland
ohh cant wait
Johnny Deeps wonka is the best movie this one is just trash 
Nothing can stop Amazon and the GPT66X which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion What you think
I want to know how many understand what Amazon is doing with GPT66X and how many refuse to adapt and still continue in their private bubble This will sooner or later be in everyones brain pretty sure about that
Review for the new Amazon GPT66X would be good pls bro
Come with me and youll see a world of your imagination
your lucky I like Paddington
oh my god isnt this like the sixth one
AYO shiet we willly wonka now
What
MuadDib
not bad you have my attention  it atleast looks better than the depp one
Mr bean 
Gene Wilder would have loved this
nothing tops the original
This is a great cast period 
Wow I never new I needed to see a prequel of Willy Wonkas becoming Im excited for this cast and to see this great show
Kinda ironic that Johnny Depp played the last Wonka now his daughters bf is playing this Wonka
Why am I guessing its going to be a WOKE WONKA movie
I swear if this is bad Im never going to watch movies ever again 
Im definitely not going to see this
Were done after this one though right
This is just legendary cant wait
Im ready to go back to a world of Pure Imagination
Another reminder why youtube removed the downvote button
To WB The film is supposed to be highenergy with lively songanddance numbers but you gave us none of that Please cut a more energetic trailer I want people to be drawn into this film Also please remove the Aahm making chahclit of course line at 019  it has attracted too much negative criticism already  Remember Im a fan and this is constructive crititicism
looks like it was made for DVD  Awful
i cant wait
Soooo is this still a prequel to Snowpiercer
Im already not a fan of how their intentionally making him eccentric and odd I feel those qualities were put on by Wonka deliberately in the original film to test the patience of the children as well as the adults to weed out the one good person in the lot that he could give his chocolate factory to
There is an unending supply of stories being written and published by young fresh writers that could make interesting movies especially if the director and producers improve upon the original works and yet here we are  with hollywood trying yet again to reproduce and rehash what was and still is to this day a perfect movie  Kind of sad
Gonna be a big flop
Lets dream again
While Im interested Im concerned that there will be some liberal and perverted agenda lurking in the plot  Guess Ill have to wait and see before I watch it  Hope its good
I was sold when I learned Wonka has to battle the CHOCOLATE CARTEL
The oompa loompa is british
Is this part of the harry potter universe
whattt another willy wonka movie thats so cool the johnny depp one was a mainstay of my childhood im 22 now and looking forward to this
Who up wonkin they willy right now
why is he in a jar
Its looks fun but there needs to be a dark twist by the end showcasing how he became jaded
"scratch that reverse it
THE WAY I SMILED SO WIDE"
This is an ad that I didnt regret watching I cant wait
No
Bro mr beast cast choice is funny
nope
Holy cow that cast is stacked
Hugh Grant stole the show
His he zendya Ex
So many people not getting that this is a prequel I love the gene wilder film but this can exist too an origin story for wonka seems pretty neat
So super  great to watchentertaining too
you know what this actually looks great
What the heck is this
TBs version is easily the best but this is different at least but doesnt have the same feeling
Ayo wtf Paul Atreides doing here
MrBeans entry is just fire  141
A proper sized Oompa Loompa
Oh god am I happy to see Rowan Atkinson back again
Hugh Grant as OOmpa Loompa and Timothee as hilarious Willy WOnkaI would love to see how it goes
whoa this looks real bad
Im dancing now cant turn back now
Wonka Snowpiercer Begins
Garbage
Im so excited
Its wonka time
no one asked for this
Unable a movie I want to watch
Rowan Atkinson Oh im in
Johnny Depp was too good cant imagine anyone else playing any version of Willy Wonka
"From a Chocolate Shop to a Chocolate factory 

He truly is Amazing Chocolatier"
Wonka looks incredible Timothe Chalamet is gonna be brilliant
MR BEAN
Damn Paul really took Letos death hard huh
Why is there so many bots in the comment section This movie looks horrible
Hugh Grant As Oompa Loompas
Looks cringe
THE RETURN
I cant wait for this movie it looks really good
Mr Rowan Atkinson 
Please stop Just stop
It looks good for the 21s centurys Gen Z However Wonkas character isnt bold enough compared to the previous ones I loved the original one and the one with Johnny Depp
No thanks
LMAO hows he going to explain to a black woman that he took an entire race to work for room and board I can see why hes aingle in the sequel now LOLOLOLOLLLL
Hope he stays away from peaches Also why would you let your kids hang out with Willy Wonka alone
So is this a prequel to the Johnny Depp one or the Gene Wilder one
""
Garbage
The original was my wifes favorite movie as a kid Now I get to experience this with her im so greatful for this movie
"How would I best describe this film 


"
Why isnt he black 
Of course they gonna win some Oscars They met the diversity quota
Chalamet might have the look for Wonka but the kid is a charisma vacuum
This so bad
"Once we started dancing we cant stop
That was AWESOME"
This looks really good tbh
The role suits him Good for him This guy too thin to be in action packed movies
naw Im good
The actor that plays Willy wonka doesnt really seem to fit the role at all
Nothing like the original nothing can beat that
I didnt know this was a prequel  Im soo excited now
Will we get an Origin story on the creepy Tunnel
Bro fought a little bear and thn got small
""
It looks like T Chamalet wearing a hat not as a character
Why no Filipinos in the cast Why no Mexicans Rubbish movie this
Prequel to Snowpiercer should be fun
Noway paul atriedes 
The chocolate cartel Whats next the rock going to come out and tell me hes the inventor of Rocky Road Im ready for a nitty gritty kids film lets goooooo
God this looks like a giant sack of doo
Was that Mr Mosbey
I hope they bring back the wonka bars
Nope Cant remake this classic
gonna see it mainly for the oompa loompas
Honestly this looks wonderful
Seeing Paterson Joseph FOURTH on the cast list is pretty rad
Alright you had my interest Now you have my attention Lets see if they can stir up a better origin story for Wonka than Tim Burton did which is easier done than said if you ask me
"another movie
another agenda"
Someone DeepFake Johnny with face and voice for whole movie please
The new rules are a little different than what I originally intended but they have a
Everything about this movie will make me wish this world of magic exists the second I leave the theatre
Why cant we make new movies anymore Like dude
Nah the Johnny Depp movie is better than this one
Boooooo Im not interested Remakes need to stop
Scrumdiddlyumptious
that CG oompa loompa looks BAD
Just what we need a Wonka origin story 
omg Cant wait 
Seems goody Cant touch the original
My heart smiled when I saw Rowan Atkinson
This is gonna flop so hard how desperate are these people for money
Looks awful
205 looks like Lord farquaad from Shrek 1 with orange skin and green hair
Great cast looking forward to seeing Rowan Atkinson and Matt Lucas is always great in things with this kind of humour 3 but Im gonna need me either a cameo or a clip of Wonka when hes older as Mr Johnny Depp Will be disappointed if there isnt at least one scene with him
its silly its bonkers its whimsy and magical Do we need Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa I dont know but it just looks wonderful
Will be a masterpiece for sure Look forward to it
Typical Hollywood Just keep doing remakes because were incapable of creativity
Yet another remake
I see harry potter Im sold
ah yes a movie copying the best bits from the good movie yet emulating the bad movie
Oh Its not a reboot I thought it was gonna be another reboot but its actually a prequel Im all for this Willy Wonka was such a great and mysterious character It looks like it would be fun to watch
Chalamets take feels a lot like Gene Wilders Wonka before he became jaded bitter and worn down I like it
Im not thrills 
Be honest whos hoping for a chocolate line to be released along side the film 
"THE CHOCOLATE CARTEL
WHAT THE"
Can anyone in Hollywood risk it anymore How about we try a new story Warner Bros too worried about the bottom line to do anything new or creative
Goofy ahh chocolatier
I love the actor but leave the original unless its the beginning of wonkas factory
wow
How much more debt WB want to piles up
Hugh Grant  Best Supporting Actor for the 96th Academy Awards
Chocolate shop  dont they mean factory
How tf he can see after staring into a lightbulb owch
ok this is better than i expected tim totally nailed that wonka voice
This is gonna be amazing
This actually looks pretty decent I was sold on Timothe Chalamet as an actor after seeing The King I would have liked to see Jeremy Allen White cast as Wonka though Just because he reminds me of a young Gene Wilder
Looking forward to watching this then the original 1971 film back to back This film gives me The Greatest Showman vibes
"Bro is not good at acting like Willy Wonka at all 
Terrible miscast"
Im worried about the CGI effects
i think im falling  in love again with mr wonka lol
Shill comments
Never saw this coming but holy damn
Willy wonka and the chocolate factory is such a timeless movie excited for this remake
They twinkified willy wonka
Another frigging Wonka movie No ideas in the USa movie industry Oh lets make the next Wonka a black dude and white chocolate
Wow after johnny and this Amazing 
I got one word BOO
I cant stop watching this trailer 
eh
Is it already time for another  Hollywood is eating itself
It looks absoluytely wonderfulWonkaful
timothy chalamet even look alive
Why do Warner Brothers movies for this age range all look like they were made for Harry Potter audiences
This reads as an SNL sketch for a movie that doesnt actually exist The production value seems high but Chalamet is just wrong here As if no screen test was done and he was simply cast for being Timothee Chalamet  popular actor Line delivery seems stale and forced and quite cringe Not every role is right for every actor
Who asked for this Are you so out of ideas you thought hey lets do a prequel to Charlie and the chocolate factory because weve already made THAT move twice
Have we just run out of new ideas
wonka on crack 
EEEWWWWWWWWWW this guy is wonka
Another backstory noone asked for or wanted
Obviously no one can replace Gene Wilder but this might B an entertaining dive into his best character
As I get older I never talk about movies that try to cash in on old stuff from my childhood like Ghostbusters Star Wars and whatever else Hollywood would like to ruin for me And I thought this trailer would add another movie to the list of things that ruin my classics I love so much But god damn I had smile watching this all the way though I have to go see this movie wow and their something about two old British men that appeals to me having Rowan Atkinson  Hugh Grant on screen too life is good some times I guess
Im normally the kind of person that hates prequels and remakes but this actually looks kinda good 
I can already tell this movie is going to make me laugh cry and singand I cant wait
The origin story we never knew we needed
aaaaaaaaaa cant waitt
Timothe Chalamet is miss cast  as Wonka something is off about how he is playing him
It looks like a mockery of the original movie Good cast though
Sorry Wonka Im a Mars guy all the way
Itd be wild to have a Mary Poppins cameo Ive always kind of lopped them into the same universe
I was sold at From the director of Paddington
Hard pass Thanks but no thanks Ill stick with the original which is one thing Hollywood isnt anymore
In alternate reality with the popularity of the Bear rising one can wonder how Jeremy Allan White wouldve done considering the resemblance
Why is this movie being remade again
 No
Just another example of how cheap and lazy Hollywood has gotten another unnecessary reiteration of the same storyoutcome not even 20 years since the last one Some of the stuff that is non Wonka is just goofy  dumb like the things involving the cops  whats unlawful
id love to watch rowan atkinson here hes my childhood 3
""
Looks like tons o fun
This a ripoff
The limitations of Timothys acting are striking in this trailer
"Every good thing in this world started with a dream and from the director of Paddington 
Shut up and take my money"
Pass
Looks amazing
NOO WAY
Hey guess what Ill just show the whole movie
WOKEnka
Huh I dont know Do we really need it
141
Ughhhh Im so freaking excited 
Paul Dano such a missed opportunity
sshhhhhEeeeeeessghhhhhhh
OOOOO MMMMM GGGG  I already know if this is a hit they will make a sequel to the original movie unlike that trash Tim Burton made 
TBH I was hoping Timothee would be more zany as Wonka It was giving beige
Im not watching it
"I absolutely loved the original 
Nothing in this trailer makes me want to see it 
maybe Hugh Laurie"
Astroturfing is ridiculous in this thread
If only they would do with  too because Im addicted with that sweet
Surely in a world of 8 billion people you could find someone who fits the role better then recycling the same old tired actors
Give Chalamet the Razzy right now
"Its CRAZY how many positive BOT comments there are trying to promote this
Im only going to say this once WE DONT NEED ANOTHER WILLY WONKA MOVIE
The Gene Wilder one was THE BEST and the Johnny Depp one was okay it was just another weird but kewl Tim Burton movie      WHY does Warner Brothers have to do this

If your going to make a movie that no one asked for and costs hundreds of millions of dollars why dont they just GIVE everyone in Africa clean water for a month food clothing You could do SO many great things with THAT much money Seems like a waste to me"
What is it going to be called and when will it be released
009  such a sweet nod to the original movie and i assume the book though i havent read it
What crazy they can make a Willy Wonka movie after in like 10 years
This looks ridiculously goofy
the lyney movie trailer
mrbeast got a competition
Ughh Diversity hires totally ruin these kinds of time piece movies for me It automatically makes it disingenuous
Skeptical but hopeful But mostly skeptical
Seems like too much Fantasy and Musicals But we shall see 
Whos here after seeing mrbeast willi wonka chocolate factory 
Its gonna be fun Im excited
i cant wait to see it in theaters
Is that mr Carson
No one wanted this
looks too goofy already typical modern silliness
Hard pass Stop making prequels
Cant wait 
Geeeze How many Willy Wonka movies are we gonna get The next 20 years we gonna have like 5 more remakes 
I fear this might be a little too sweet for my taste
After seeing that video about MetaModernism in movies and why movies dont feel like they used to I cant help but notice how many tropes were in this trailer Such as the light bulb ahah scene Imagine if they made this movie without relying on a million tropes
Sally Hawkins is always amazing 
""
i actually really like it
The story of mr beast
The original Oompa Loompa  is back   sweet
Tim has the right energy for intimate indie dramas but seems to create an energy vacuum at the center of these big movies he has been leading Dude has charisma but is definitely not the Gene Wilder type
Ok The first Willy Wonka always freaked me out and I never could really get into the one with Johnny Depp Just too much going on in that But this one is kinda catching my attention plus I do appreciate how they went back to the orange faced green haired Oompa Loompa
It would be lovely if they include middleages Wonka in this film It surely be fantastic when Mr Johhny Depp reprise his iconic role
I wanna see him enslave to umpa lumpas
This is trash
Im just not comfortable with that oompa loompa funny but kinda I dont know what to say hahaha
ROWAN ATKINSON THE LEGEND
Looks boring
I pinkie promise Thats the most solemn vow there is from The Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan
Honestly Hollywood isnt even trying anymore  Endless prequels sequels spinoffs nothing is original anymore
Nope
Another one
great actor and a perfect role
Noooooooowah Just NO 
Another film where the yanks have been cast instead of Brits  Ill pass
Just to clarify to anyone this is a PREQUEL not a reboot
101 HOLUP ITS ROWAN FREAKING ATKINSON I ALREADY LOVE THIS MOVIE
Relieved it looks like this beloved character was not fcked up in this version Looking forward to this movie
I was looking for a trailer for this yesterday and found out there were none Great timing
Im so gonna eat a chocolate bar while watching this in theaters
Have to see this just to see Hugh as an Ompa Loompa
This movie tells the origins of Willy Wonka before he was a candy man
Ngl hatter compare but he aint no Johnny Depp
""
Looks true to the whacky spirit of Dahl and the sweetness of the 70s movie Wilder was a different beast but this looks good
I love how Roald Dahl this feels he may not have been the best dude but he could sure create fantastical fun worlds and I cant wait plus Rowan Atkinson
It is so cringe when they make period dramas and try to make filmgoers believe that diversity existed at a time when the population was homogenous
Why didnt they make a movie about Charlie running the factory
not really excited about this one  Im in the Dune trance  Nothing interests me but Dune  lol
Director of Paddington solid cast definitely seems like its going for the vibe of Roald Dahls books Honestly Im feeling pretty good about this
Thank God theyre warning us that this movie is a musical At least Warner Bros havent made a Batman musical
Cant wait for the scene where Wonka enslaves all the Oompa Loompas only to make some overdrawn political statement on capitalism in America
Idk why i forgot this was coming
WHY IS EVERYTHING A REMAKE PREQUEL OR SEQUEL I CANNOT TAKE IT
Am I the only one that thinks this movie just looks meh I dont know it just looks like its missing that spark  Maybe the movie will be better than what Im seeing here
"All i gotta say is

YEET

ROLL UP

SKRT THAT

DROP THAT

POP THAT

AAAYYY Cant wait"
Is this a prequel to Gene Wilders one
Ill probably go check it out not going to lie But I cant lie its interesting how this is a reboot of the reboot
way more gene wilder than johnny depp THANK GOD
Nobody can replace Jhonny Depp  as Willy Wonka  Period 
Is that Mr bean 142
Is this the origin story to Snowpiercer
Yknow what Im okay with this
Stellar cast With Chalamet are Olivia Colman Sally Hawkins Hugh Grant Rowan Atkinson and more Hope this film delivers Looking forward to it
Wasnt going to watch this movie but now that I see Carson is in it Im on board
Whats with all the obvious bot posts here This film looks like a steamy pile of guano The Oompa Loompa part will be fun but the rest looks forgettable
Am I the only person that thinks Timothe Chalamet has zero possibly even less than zero acting chops It just seems as if he is reading the lines off like any random person off the street might Where is the character the emotion the pathos Theres just nothing thereSide note Paul King is a legend and if anyone can make this movie great its him Paddington for life
Ok did we really need a remake so annoying at this point
I know Chalamet is trying to act out of his comfort zone but this is just cringe awkward and a noticeable miscast
Made me want to eat some chocolate
Jeremy Allen White would have been perfect for this
""
this is gonna be fun
Lets keep rebooting reboots we already rebooted At least I like the actor they picked and Im hoping this does sweeten the deal
Looks bad
I hate to think whats inside HIS chocolate Peach
Hollywood destroying another classic character
Wonka is the ultimate gem from my childhood This film pays a heartfelt tribute to the incredible Gene Wilder who in my humble opinion delivered the most exceptional portrayal of Wonka ever The musical nods to the original brought tears of pure joy to my eyes My happiness knows no bounds Im so happy
hello no  ruining the classic
If yall wanna watch an original movie you should watch one flew over the cuckoos nest  jack Nicholson or natural born killers  woody Harrison
Mr Bean
Looks REALLY REALLY stupid
So quiet up and listen down Nope Stratch thatreverse it
Looks like dogshit
mary poppins son
Willie Woka
A quota movie
"THE ICONIC 
OOMPA LOOMPAS"
Johnny depp did the best
Anything with Sally Hawkins take my money  
Im definitely going to see this 
no your name is paul atreides
""
So this is the dark future Paul forsaw
Rowan Atkinson is in this Im sold I dont even care if hes a major or minor character though he might have been perfect as the Oompa Loompas
"Yes Diversity

Another one for the woke trash can"
"I was already to HATE this Another remake Ah An unexpected prequel 

WaitHugh Grant as an OompaLoompa

Im in"
goosebumps a classic in making
"One word Wilder
Second word Stop"
How many times are they gonna remake this
Justwhy
This looks terrible
"I feel like explaining the backstory of Wonka and how he got his business started to such a degree ruins the magic of what makes the original story good The wonder and sense of the unknown caused by the whimsical factory and its enigmatic owner is a lot more compelling with how its a sort of escapism for the impoverished Charlie 
The magical candy being displayed and featured on the street seems to be an attempt bring the world of pure imagination out of the factory ruins the whole point of Wonkas character and purpose in the story  to me at least"
Looks terrific
Tontonan masa kecil gw 
Nothing like johnny depp version
Race and gender swapped little Charlie
why did i thought this film would have a much DARKER tone 
Timothy is a good actor fr
The no daydreaming sign cemented this for me as something I need to see
I guess I just dont understand the appeal of Chalamet the visuals look spectacular but hes so one note
my childhood actor is here rowan atkinson 
A must for me
Looks whimsical and wholesome  why do I feel like the guy playing wonka is simply not a good actor
Gives me that Jingle Jangle A Christmas Journey type feel  I love it
Johnny Depp was way better and will always be
Im so excited to see this movie Ive been a willy wonka fan for years
The 2nd remake I mean you really dont have anything new ideas 
Timothy is not that busy his done with dune2 and this
"intresting looks kind lf fun but where is it meant to be meant to be set the police look german which is kind of odd if it meant to be set in the united kingdom

plus a proper looking oompa loompa better than the last movies version of them"
I could see this being turned into a musical
LOVED THIS MOVIE NOW IM DEPRESSED ABOUT IT BC IT WAS STRIPPED AND MADE OVER AGAIN LEAVING THE ORIGINAL LITTLE BLACK BOY AS CHARLIE AND THE OOMPA LOOMPAS WERE LITTLE BLACK MEN ITS OK THO BC ONE DAY WE WILL SEE AN ALL BLACK WILLY WONKAJUST LIKE THE WIZARD OF OZ WE GOT THE WIZ
They even got mr bean in it
Im confused is the acting supposed to be bad
Who else can tell who the diversity hires are 
"You hear that That raspy crunching sound Oh look its Hollywood scraping the bottom outta the barrel FILL IN THE BLANK  is being oppressed by capitalismcolonialismmenwhites and needs to find that inner magic and a POC sidekick to fight back 
A Mulan
B The Little Mermaid
C Willy Wonka 
D Dumbo 
E All of the above

Its like Hollywood has made one vague movie script and just keeps switching names out to release it under different titles"
Well another pile of not chocolate
okay for the longest time I had my doubts after the disaster that was the Tim Burton Willy Wonka I usually love his stuff but NOT that one Gene Wilders version will always be Wonka for me But seeing this trailer and Timothys lines and such this actually looks like it could be good I may actually look forward to watching this
Who will be Augustus Gloop Violet Beauregarde Veruca Salt Mike Teavee and Charlie Bucket
This actually looks good this is what fans mean by dont remake what we love just make something new and better
not too excited for the cgi oompa loompa though
Elioooo 
Is Veruca Salt here
Willy wonka the creator off the inflation fetish
I just got my braces today and now Im not allowed to eat chocolate 
People are raving about Paddington The original is unmatched If not just for the song pure imagination
This looks so wholesome Chalamet is excellent casting and the visuals and tone are perfect for Christmas
Johnny Depp is better 
This never needed to be made Should have cast a better actor if was decided to be made
should be a cross over harry potter origin story too where wonka gets thrown out of hogwarts for pretending to be harry potters  grand father only to go back to muggle land and use his ill trained wizard skills to make mad confectionaries to pay for his new covert wizard guild which trains up a vicious oompah loompah army whose sole mission is to take down the insufferable elitist party poopers at hogwarts by stuffing their portentous mouths with ever lasting gobstoppers
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET has been absolute gold every Movie hes had a major part in 
106 is that who i think it is
I love harry potter and love Paddington Im definitely gonna love this hope they make a bunch of sequels and hows going to play charlie
yay we can see how he became a murderer
Hot Hot Garbage so thats a no from me
warner brothers should be ashamed   death 2 capitalism they removed willy wonkas autism what a horrible disappointment
This is going to be awesome 
BRuH
Finally something that looks like the old movies great and fantastical
Another butcher job on a classic 
Well it cant be any worse than that catastrophe TimBurton remake
I was afraid they would change the OompaLoompas because thats what hey do these days but no this looks like an actual attempt at a prequel to the original film
"Fizzy lifting drinks Lickable wallpaper Slugworth GRANDPA Hsaw Aknow Hasha Wakanow The chocolates The wonkavator Rachmaninoff piece as the door key Cheer up Charlie song
the oompa loompas
God theres so much nostalgia i am feeling right now 
Timothee actually fit the role of Johnny and Gene Wilders Wonka Its like 2 personalities in one 
Literally couldnt wait to see this on the big screen someday

Hold your breath Make a wish Count to three"
Why do we need another one of these movies
LETS GOOO
THEEEEE PHILL LEWIS OF SUITE LIFE OF ZACK AND CODY FAME MY MR MOSBY a must watch
This looks disappointing
This looks bland
Not a very impressive trailer Hopefully the film itself is good
cocholate made in arrakis
"is that rowan atkinson 102
wooooow"
I dont know about this one
One word  why
My first thought was lol this looks bad and then I saw Hugh Grant as the oompa loompa and changed my mind
Big yikes
I was looking for slugworth reference
Ill be glad when Hollywood gets rid of these dark color tones
Oh cool a prequel
noted
Im sick of remakes
Its going to be interesting to see if this film can pull in todays young audience A prequel for Wonka definitely is a good idea
And Thats Why it Looks Like Willy Wonka And the Chocolate Factory and Charlie and the Chocolate Factory And This WONKA Is Coming Soon in December 2023
Who wonkin their willy rn
Is that the Butler from Downton Abbey I see
Charlie and The Chocolate Factory is one of my fav childhood movie now as an adult i gotta see the prequel 
RIP gene wilder the ordinal wonka
but like Why though
This looks great especially with Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa which is perfection Timothee Chalamet is just not selling it as Willy Wonka though not for me
This unironically looks incredible
I have found the next movie Ill be seeing
another vapid woke disastershocking
goosebumps
this looks far better than the johnny depp one
Wow really taking a step backwards making Wonka movies i see
yawns
That looks like a GREAT movie  I cant wait to see it 
Yep Johnny was better
He put the Oompa Loompa in a jar
Hey Instead of this lets get a sequel where Charlie owns the factory
Yes I cant wait 
Youre missing the fact that hes Count Dookus son
Looking forward to it
yeah I am on board as well but what they did to Hugh Grant is insane
Lets freaking go
Literally looks terrible Not needed at all
May thy chocolate chip and shatter
Tim Chalamet sucks
Were all hate watching this right now
This is just the carabret sidequest from Yakuza 0
this looks just ridiculously boring is there even a trace of Roald Dahls spit and vinegar Wonka isnt some model either hes an impish batty candy genius should have just made charlie and the great glass elevator 
"102 Mr Bean

141"
115 he always fcking gets me 
You know I was initially skeptical of this movie when I first heard the premise But it looks like a lot of fun and solidly whimsical Plus the fact that the director of Paddington directed this movie definitely convinced me to at least check this movie out Looks like itd be fun to see in theaters too
All of my favourite things OOPS Wrong movie  Willy Wonka my favourite Timothy Chalamet my favourite The OOmpa loompas my favourite This movie liked already
Willy wonka is supposed to have energy and life and fire  No offence its a hard performance to pull off but Im not seeing Timothy pull it off
This looks super good the only problem is that it completely bashes and ignores the fact that George Weasley is actually Willy Wonka Unless this story takes place before Willy Wonka but after Harry Potter
Interesting prequel movie  I like how the Oompa Loompa looks exactly like the ones from the 1971 classic  I remember Fickelgruber Prodnose and of course Slugworth from both the story book and movies  Its going to be interesting to see them have bigger roles in this movie
Good grief  Now Wonka is going down the woke path too   Only the wise and sage advice from the black female child allowed Wonka to create his empire 
Mr Bean 
Is that Mr Moseby
I liked the part when he said Its wonking time and wonked his willy all over them
I dont know something about these movies pandering to the audiences nostalgia is getting pretty tedious Im sure this movie is good and all but originality is left to the smaller budget studios while these higher budget films constantly churn out familiar properties because its safe Then again I suppose originallity is just box office poison because people dont like unfamiliar things nowadays Does anyone else feel this way
Why is the Oompa Loompa so small
This kinda looks unhinged and Im obsessed The performances look self aware and it just seems quirky wholesome and cute Its the same team from paddington and feels like a kind of British childrens film version of a Wes Anderson movie I cant wait haha
This looks absolutely horrible
My man Timothee Chalamet as Wonka is something I never thought would ever come to existence in this day and age I bet hes about to blow box office records with his performance in this
Welp cant be too much worse than the Depp version
who up wonking they willy rn
Trash
wonkas performance looks meh but paddington director is promising
Hands down this looks waaaaaay better than the Johnny deep versiona hundred times better And for sure an homage to the great Gene wilder
hmmmidk how I feel about the Caucasianisation of the Umpa Lumpas
Run Away by Mr Bean is just what I need to be convinced to watch 
I am more hyped than ever for this movie now It looks like an instant classic
They brought back the classic look for Oompa Loompas  yes yes yes
Still wont tackle the great glass elevator huh to bad
Now theres a third movie
Err no thanks
This is why you audition for actors timothee chalmet does not fit this role at all
make something original you bums
Umm you know you contacted the movie and book right he was working in the flying candy when he was looking for Charlie
This looks so dumb Just another way to step all over my childhood 
I am here for Hugh Grant as a dancing Oompa Loompa
This is the part where willy wonka turn into Heisenberg
Weve already had two screen adaptions of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Can we move on
SO PROUD OF YOU TIMMIE we will be watching 
Yeah this is going to be great
This actually looks rubbish
This is going to be so SO GOOOD
Honestly Dont care about the movie I just want them to bring back the chocolate I MISS THE SCRUMDIDDLYUMPTIOUS BARS THEY SOLD AT WOOLWORTHS WHEN I WAS A CHILD Best chocolate ever
What trailer are you guys watching Atkinson is great but this is cash grab nonsense  Already been done TWICE
Dune Part II looks a little strange
I think Hugh Grantaloompa is going to be the best thing ever
At first I was all so we get yet another pointless remake see Footloose among others including for that matter Little Mermaid and Haunted Mansion or unnecessary backstory story see Maleficent among others but OK this MIGHT work Paddington was very good Still I saw nothing whatsoever of Dahls book in this trailer I am marginally optimistic
Tbch this looks so bad Im gonna love it 
Its unbelievable that this would eventually lead to snow piercer
This actually is the type of wimsy that people may expect from a willy wonka film
Seeing Timothee  Chalamet at first I was like HUH but then I realized in this movie he resembles a young Gene Wilder
This looks adorable
Film would be 1000000000000000000x better with Johnny Depp instead of thst little annoying American Timothy guy but oh well
This is just an incredible castb
CHILDHOOD REBORN
Thats my pure imagination when I hope Johnny will be an easter egg or something but hey we got Rowan this is a must watch now
I was pretty meh until Hugh Grant   Maybe it should be called the Ken effect when a supporting character saves the trailer like Ryan Gosling in Barbie
Hes trying his darndest to be silly but hes too serious inherently
TIMOTHY NO WAY 
Oh goodness here we go
Id rather have Paddington 3
The new Willy winks seems fine but none can replace JDhe had smthin induced in his character thts hard to find in anyone elses potrayal
If you told me WB was moderating this comment section I wouldnt be surprised one bit This is getting ripped everywhere else on the internet But here Fishy
Belch
Watching in a minutes looking for where are the kids    So this movie about adult now
Ang pogi wahhhhhhh
"Gene Wilder would roll in his grave

So many paidbot comments here every comment mentions Paddington and how much everyones been waiting for Wonkas origin story"
I am happy we are getting a normal version of wonka  Warner bros Happy Tim is not doing it
Good lineup Matt Lucas Rowan Atkinson Mat Baynton
"Eye roll
Gene wilder did ot best Depp botched it and this is laaaaaaaaame"
jesus god please stop
Dont they understand no one wants remakes of this
Im so excited for this 
I love how Dune part 2 will probably still be on theatres when this comes out Not me wondering whos more high Willy Wonka or Paul Atreides
Is that the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan
WHY just leave it alone wtf
So were still not doing original movies Okay
Rowans there Im gonna watch this
"Hahahahahahahahahahhahhahahhahaha

WTF 

Hahahahahahahaha"
Paddington Yes Idk how I feel about Timmy he might out performed by everyone else Im ok to be wrong tho
"Everyone loves Paddington
The pressure is ON D ahhahah"
A Wonka Prequel imagine that
"Where are the RealD 3D screenings

IMAX has been shutting down locations these past several months"
Wow this looks really good Not a fan of Timmy but Im excited for this He seems perfect for wonka
Already love the trailer
I have to admitI am ONLY on board with this movie if it includes an explanation of how Willy Wonka turned from general chocolatier into psychopath murdering children to put in his chocolate which was definitely what was happening in the book
why does he look like daniel thrasher 
While I was at work today I thought about Charlie and the chocolate factory  and willie wonka and the chocolate factory and thought to myself  man they should really make a movie just on Wonkas upbringing and of course Bam  this is what I see in my feed  thats kind of wild if you ask me lol and it was the most random thought too
Maybe dont give away the entire plot in the trailer next time
Omg its his backstory Im so excited
all the top comments are bots im guessing itll be forgotten within a year
Does anyone in this entire video realize that chocolate is Mexican
If they turned this into a musical I will gouge my eyes out
I didnt laugh until the very last bit Hugh Grant is obviously still desperate for people to forget his PM dance in Love Actually 
"Where is the goofiness of Wonka 
I think Rowan Atkinson wouldve played an excellent Willy Wonka If he was younger"
So if that was the mom then that means this is a story of Charlie after he got it or was the mom wonkas and Charlies
Looks absolutely horrendous
WONKA BEGINS Timothy is going to dominate this year with this and dune 2
Why does this actually look good
Im so excited for this movieee it looks so good 
Im having a bad start today but this trailer just lift up my mood thank you will be looking forward to the film 
You had me when Hugh Grant started dancing LOL This looks like a beautiful fantasy that I want to see  just like the movie with Gene Wilder
I hate how good this looks
Trash
I thought that there might be a tiny chance to see Jhonny deep in there
It cant be worse than Tom  Jerry Willy Wonka  the Chocolate Factoryright
Are they going to make this a franchise
Wow Chalomet is actually going to act in this  I dont think Ive ever seen him do anything more than brood and mutter incoherently
I personally think this looks awful
Here we go Mama gave me chills
So this is a prequel to the 1971 film Willy Wonka  The Chocolate Factory Im assuming as much since the suit that Willy Wonka wears in this movie looks very similar to the suit that Gene Wilder wore as Willy Wonka and of course the Oompa Loompa at the end of the trailer looks exactly like the Oompa Loompas from the original film Itll be awesome if the very ending of the m takes place in 1971 and ends with Willy Wonka announcing the Golden Ticket contest to the world
Ohhhthis could be good
Please no
This looks terrible Hopefully it turns out alright
So Beetlejuice and Willy Wonka Having a Sequel Huh
I want that nutty in my mouth this Christmas 
Of course hell have a Chocolate GF
Except for the newer faces the remakes have nothing on the 1972 character
Where is Charlie at I didnt see a white boy
isnt that the mother from the last willy wonka film
He is NOT convincing  Is he even acting   LOL
casting is great and the director is solid  However though I love Chalamets acting in general he appears to be trying too hard to come off as whimsical rather than it seeming natural Still the movie seems like itll be a great and entertaining watch
"117

Keegan kind of looks like the magician cop from Key and Peele "
Wonka More like Wonky
Willy Wonka origin story okay this is not what I expected at all
directed by the director of Paddington and produced by the producer of Harry Potter Oh this is going to be legendary
Oh Its Willy Wonka HES BACK 
Willy Wonker
Its pretty much more interesting than the previous
that acting is horrible
No blacks in the original movie but now okay
I gotta check this out
Cash grab Come on man
""
Why
Im interested at least I hope itll be good but hope is all I can do till I see it for myself
I love the Gene Wilder version I hope this movie respects it I do know itll be better than the Tom and Jerry version
OMGGGG I cant wait
Paddington has bought this movie a lot of good will I hope it isnt squandered
Too late Ive started dancing now Needs to be on at tshirt 
Cool this i love cant wait 
Music  inspire by candy crush inspire
Aint none of them worthy to drink Gene Wilders bathwater But I digress
PREQUEL
Whos ready for the Half in the Bag for this one
Nah
The forced diversity injects totally took me out of it
The old  movie will always be the best
This kids Wonka is about to be the Jared Leto Joker of the Wonka movies Lmfao 
Timothee is everywhere its sometimes overrated already But this trailer and the director is telling me this is something worth watching Also THE WAY IS GASPED WHEN IS SAW ROWAN ATKINSON Rowans mere seconds of cameo in the trailer made me all the more excited
I wanted to hate it before going in but it looks awesome
I only want to watch it because mr beans in it
Mr Bean is in the film im watching it XD
Mr Bean
WAS THAT MR BEAN
Very rare  a trailer that makes me laugh and want to see the movie  very good 
PLEASE bring Wonka Bars back 
sally hawkins paddington HARRY F POTTER IM DOWNN
DEI
Its full of hideous fakeversity  No thanks
im kinda into this
This looks lame AF and the acting from the main character is actually pretty bad
Can not wait for this
This looks very interesting about time writers producers and studios quit trying to remake stories and come up with something original
Cant believe it actually looks great Looks very fascinating and just a fun time at the theaters When timothee was announced as wonka I was extremely sceptical about it and now that this has dropped I can actually see it And what a plethora of casts
Why am I smiling Is this normal I need help I shouldnt be smiling
ruined it by not having real little people playing the Umpas
Thank you for bringing us what we again dont want and didnt ask for 
yes yes and yes
 cant wait
Cash grab Make something original please
Why
Okay You have my attention
Omg mr bean is in here
Wheres mr beast
Snowpiercer Origins of Wonka
I honestly didnt know Timothy Chalamet could smile
Timothee Chalamet was 100 the right choice for this Then again hes the right choice for everything So so talented
This looks like a cute movie to watch with family When this guy grows up he can probably play as the Joker with such facial expressions
looks terrible scratch the current project fire the whole team hire me as the sole proprietor and pay me 20 million dollars to make it right
Timothee chalamet is so fine I need to watch asap
Imma watch bc it looks rlly fun and i love timothe chamalet
Looks way too woke Pass
""
Who asked for this
looks really good I might watch this movie
No No No No No No No No No Make it stop
It looks cute but I still dont think this is necessary The 1979 performance works because there isnt a backstory its a mystery
The No Day dreaming just killed me
"Hear that 


Its Disney broke crying "
There ought to be a park for everything DC and Warner Bros related the worlds of Harry Potter and Fantastic Beasts the worlds of ScoobyDoo and Looney Tunes the worlds of Tom and Jerry and the DC Extended Universe Wonkas factory the Polar Express and even Jump City
""
Kinda feel like they missed with not going with Jeremy Allen White dude is a spot on younger version of Gene Wilder
I hope they dont butcher my favorite novel of roald dahl
Not feeling it  sorry Timmy just meeeeh  and musical Nope 
why isnt Wonka black
"I think I know the moral lesson of this film 
Everything starts off as a dream and work hard to turn that dream into a reality"
Cool
Gene Wilder will always be the real Willy Wonka
Meh nothing beats the Johnny depp and gene wilder movies
Ya se que es una historia de fantasa pero se me hacer extrao ver negros en traje durante la poca de la revolucin industrial en Inglaterra
Its that chalameeee guy
Finally A Willy Wonka movie that WONT give me nightmares 
I WANT THISS
Since I was a teen Ive anticipated this moment 
Looks meh to me but im a grown man so
WILL DEFINITELY WATCH THIS IN CINEMA 3
Honestly this looks way better than I expected
The callback to Gene Wilder won me immediately I need to see this asap
If its timothee chalamet Id watch it
I hate to say it but this looks like another here today gone tomorrow movie with no real substance
But how will this affect the WonkaSnowpiercer theory
THAT IS GOING TO BE SO COOL OMG IM IN TEARS
No thank you
"Nope

Im out already"
When Wonka was young he was forbidden to eat candy because of a giant brace extender but that didnt stop him from fulfilling his wish
a 3rd one dawgg aint no way
looks woke and cgi oompa loompas again because there are no people who are vertically impaired
Cant wait
No one can replace old Wonka
This is going to be absolute TRASH
They need to do a move for the book Wanka and the Great Glass Elevator
Who asked for another Hollywood remake Stop please
Alternative Universe or the one that ties up with the book and the Johnny Deeps Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Wonka Although the Oompa Loompa again is from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory so meaning Snowpiercer is still in effect
""
What decade is this movie set in It could be a classic time
More proof that nepotism is alive and well in Hollywood Im sick of this Timothee Chalamet guy getting pushed He was good in one low budget film and has sucked in everything after Oh but hes friends with Speilbergs son so that explains it
I love timothee so much and by no means is this an insult but something about timothee playing wonka is so funny 
A Wonka origin story Yikes
Ive wondered in the past if there would ever be a backstory made for this story we all already know Honestly Im looking forward to watching it since its made by an incredibly talented group of people
BRO AY NO WAY THIS REAL
This feels like the greatest Showman met Dr dolittle 
this looks retarded
Im not here for it like wtf  how many remakes do we need This hit is getting old
After Willy retired and allowed Charlie to rule the factory in his place he had a daughter named Willa who Ill hire Demi Lovato to voice Casey Jr and PuttPutt will burst through a newly revamped version of his factory while on the run from Slovene Islandin Ghost Train and the custard flood
Hugh Grant never expected thatthis is EPIC
watch we will all be eating chocolate during the movie
It looks lame
Yet another remake of a movie that will ruin the original and my childhood
Roman Awkinston and Hugh Grant
This is gonna bomb
But we still cant get the real chocolate bars back on the shelves
It would appear Johnsons Hats back on
Great opportunity ruined with horrible casting of Chalamets lack of personality
I see this is what happened to Paul after he became Muaddib and after the birth of his son Leto II  When he went to wander the deserts of Arrakis he secretly became a mad chemist to produce candy
Doesnt do much for me Sorry Long live THE WW Gene Wilder
this will be intresting
Ok im literally just watching cause paddington is the goat
They can make all the willy wonka movies they want but nothing will top gene wilders version the umpalumpas were all real people while this version of them are obviously cgi since that was hugh grant playing one
"Ah the whistle from
Willy Wonka nice"
Just based on this the last looks amazing but Timothy Chalamet is seriously giving high school production acting Something doesnt feel right about this particular casting idk itll be very hard to live up to the OG Gene Wilder Even Johnny Deppy gave such a good performance with his portrayal as Willy Wonka TC isnt weird enough for the part just my honest opinion
Timothee Chalamet is going crazy with the movies
If Land Paste were born it can make Willy Wonkas amazing factory a reality and his candy might be real and sold everywhere
hes just so cute cant wait
This will get cancelled because Hugh Grant played an oopa lupa instead of a real dwarf
Every good thing in this world started with a dream So you hold on to yours 
Then there came a junior musical play besides a Broadway play and several commercials related to the confectioner
Hughs not the Oompa we need but the Loompa we deserve
This actually looks good definitely feels like Timothy Chalamet is trying to emulate Gene Wilders Wonka which is the only Wonka as far as Im concerned
JUst stop  PleASE
I thing the caracter is different from JD version
Will be epic
Where is Johnny Johnny
218 those cute hand movements though
After liberating Arrakis and seizing control of Spice production Wonka the voice from the Outer World set his eyes on the chocolate market
Looks shite
So its a musical Work
Gene Wilder who played Willy Wonka in the 1971 film died in 2018 Johnny Depp who also played Willy Wonka in the 2005 film was supposed to be recast for the sixth and final Pirates of the Caribbean film
Trash
No
Yet another remake out of Hollywood as there arent any writers that are intelligent enough to create something new
Never thought I would want a Willy Wonka origin movie I cant wait to finally agree on one Wonka movie instead of fighting over nostalgia vs remakes
Excited for the movie Lets gooooo
Why do we need this  A third movieyou have got to be kidding me
Timothe Chalamets line delivery in this trailer has about as much spark as a first read
Tbh we all are having a feeling that Johnny did it better
Now that i think about it I wouldnt be surprised if Willy Wonkas wife is  Mary Poppins
What did I just watch Nice movie but very very different from the original 2 movies dont know how I feel but might be good 
I love how whimsical it is Very true to the feel of the original and I have faith in the Director of Paddington to create a masterpiece
I was not prepared to see Hugh Grant in that form whatsoever
FINALLY a sweet wholesome movie 
Legend Willy wonka is back  this movie going show how he started  cant wait this December have good treat for us 
First it was Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory Then in 2005 we got a more book accurate movie called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory Now we are getting a new movie called WONKA Fine lets run it back hopefully one last time
I was kinda hoping Johnny Depp to have a cameo hereeven Charliesomething of a little throwback story telling wouldnt you say
He needs to be weirder Hes not weird enough to be Wonka
This looks horrible
Paddingtons directory Hmmmmm this gonna be a great one
We are finally getting a origin story of the crazy man that is Willy Wonka this is gonna be awesome
and of course regardless of the time period a movie is set in its as multicultural as current year lmao
i mean Wonkas accent shouldnt be a bit British mix with other accent since hes been around the world just asking 
The chocolate must flow
Im gonna be honest I was very hesitant about this film  As of this trailer Im going to see this in the theater
"Willy wonka is my childhood memories
I remember I always mesmerized and excited when I watch that movie all the time in my TV
And here now Im crying because this trailer makes me bringing back my childhood memories "
MATTHEW BAYNTON
The acting seems bad Pedo Disney must not be able to afford better actors since they chose to go woke and are going broke
Personally I wouldve casted someone that is not white as Wonka That whole white person being the main character is just so overdone in Hollywood 
Smh
Whoever is playing wonka his acting and delivery is just stunted and awful
This looks great
Something tells me chocolate sales will go straight through the roof and everyones butt this Christmas season Diabolically Delicious Loved the original classic with Gene Wilder and hopefully this one will be a new classic for kids of today Nice
Took ya long enough
i was wondering how wonka get his return of investment or break event point in such a great dance like that
"Glad they didnt make him black 

Oh wait this is Warner Bros not Disney or Netflix"
Looks great
If they avoid the evils of wokism leftism then it will be a success Hopefully HollywoodDisney losing over ten billion the past few years pushing that insanity has finally taught them something but leftists rarely admit they are wrong let alone learn
the next Johnny Depp right here
Not looking forward to this
Looks mid ngl
Now that would definitely be a very interesting movie to watch 
i have two firm opinions regaurding this trailer  1 Chalemette is just Adam Drivers younger brother and 2 I am 100 seeing it because of Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
ugh
No thanks Ill stick with the original
He seems So normal
No wonder his chocolate is so good he probably adds the spice melange to it 
Nope
Timmothy so overrated I swear
041  explain this is worst
gee theyre giving this guy every big roles right now  he gives me the same vibe as ezra miller dont know why  the hollywood broken baby vibe 
Helluva cast
Hes not good for the role
He doesnt fit the character
I havent even watched the first one and theyve already made a second
this movie gonna be a bomb aint no way replacing Johny deep
I cant wait for WONKA
ANOTHER REMAKE Hollywood is devoid of originality and dreaming up new worlds to explore
anyone else feel this actor isnt very good he doesnt really sell willy wonka its just his regular voice slightly pitched up but thats it its like 10 the effort of chris pratt doing mario
Nah its tooo woke there not supposed to have a black woman or colored people in this movies damn
WILLY WONKA OMG OMG OMG
I took a trip to the chocolate factory to make it out
How do you like it Dark White Nutty 
This looks so bad They are making him pretty much Marry Poppins
Yeah man THIS Im looking forward to THIS And LOVE the call backs to the original Nice
They got the cinematographor that worked on OLDBOY for this movie
Is that Rowan Atkinson Well I am gonna watch this
Bruh just think of a new thing already
This looks really good
All I can think is that some time between this movie and the Charlie classic hes gonna end up firing that girl and all those other people
cant believe they gave him a black love interest
Sorry Im not buying this guy playing Wonka not feeling it
Why
I did like Paddington but Ill wait for the Critical Drinkers review before spending money
First saw this I thought  how are they going to ruin Willy Wonka But based on the trailer it looks ok See how it goes
Nope This looks terrible
This is a MASTERPIECE Give Tim the Oscar already Wilder cant hold a candle to ol Timmy Well except for my boy Depp HAHA fr though
I cant wait to never watch this RIP Gene Wilder youll never be topped
Im pretty sure that the Christmas of 2023 will be chocolatey I wanna watch that film
Tim Burtons looked way better
I dont know who this Wonka is but he doesnt seem like he fits the part No where even near the personality of Wilder or Depp Both wonkas were dark but comedic this guy is neither
This lacks the same feeling that the original movie had just another sequel prequel remake reboot reimagining whatever it is that lacks the charm and appeal of the original film
So excited 
This looks amazing
Im more hyped for this than the fnaf movie
Why is this giving me cringe
This looks really good
Oh boy
Johnny Depp wannabe
Wheres Johnny depp
There is something super off putting and uncanny about this trailer I cant put my finger on it but Im disturbed
looks fun and good
"First I was like meh
Then I was like seems promising
Finally I was like yes"
Really excited for this but I hope that the blacks only play a minor part rather than a main role
Stupid
Wow A snowpiercer prequel
You can now watch Wonka played by any actor courtesy of AI
This looks very promising
Looks good
Finally something old plus something new instead of something old all retold
All the sounds made very excited yet I remain deeply skeptical Although Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa has softened my skepticism ever so slightly
Only completely dummies would actually like this but given this is a yank channel that checks out significantly
Getting serious David Thrasher vibes he should be playing this role 100
This and the Barbie movie trailers have left me feeling like Im back in 1999 when movies still had some magic
good actor but horrible choice for wonka
Idc what ppl say this is a prequel to the Johnny depp Charlie and the chocolate factory
So the joker is wonker now Well alrighty then
This must be Willy Wonkas backstory
Ooh ok I might watch 
I love Timothe Chalamet but he isnt right for this style Comes off superficially performative Perhaps the full movie will be better
Paddington Ayo this is already a bagner
Lolthere are no laws of gravity Gravity is simply a theory Keep the programming alive
Im glad that its rooted in the same sort of look that the 1971 film is Im very much looking forward to seeing this film
"Well at least its a prequel to the gene wilder version and not the Johnny Depp version thank heavens Nice to here pure imagination and umpa lumpa tune 
Dont care how I want to watch it nowwwww"
So how woke is this one going to be
this defiantly has the Magic as Paddinton and it has the heart as the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
THIS is going to be the best film of 2023 and nobody is gonna tell me otherwise
Cant wait until Christmas 
Absolute shait
WOW that actually looks good 
Johny depp
Sooo a remake of a reboot that has now been remade into a prequel
If you would have told me that there would be a Willy Wonka movie starring Timothe Chalamet I wouldnt have believed you yet here we are Though its odd im excited haha
What an obvious flop  Who asked for this movie   
does Hugh Grant enslave his people to escape the glass jar
Wonka Before the Madness 
Willie Potter 
Will you guys make a Tolkiens story about war in the north Based on the novel of courseso the story between Hobbit and LotR will be completed
surprisingly i choose to read the novel for the first time recently so wonkas been on my mind lately this definitely looks interesting hopefully will be better then Depps version that one was always a little cringey for me growing up after reading the book yeah that one is not as good or close as wilder version imo
Whoooooaaaaa
whose up wonking their willy rn
""
I hate trailers nowadays they show most of the movie makes no sense
This aint it chief
This lacks soul
Guys its my bar timothee
I got Johnny Depp and my future kids are gonna get this boring dude 
In an alternate universe we get a less whimsical slightly darker version of this with Jeremy Allen White as a younger Wonka but not an origin story
Seeing Rowan Atkinson as the priest i can only think of his priest stand up bits xDDD ahhh it looks like its going to be an awesome movie 
Willy Wonka was our childhood
So we get to find out why Willy wonka created that creepy tunnel
Paul atreides made a lucrative business selling chocolate after escaping arrakis
this loooks like such a good movie my jaw was dropped during the whole trailer xD
Mr Bean
I love Paddington 
tttttTIMOTHY CHALAMET My gorgeous honey bun sugar poo is playing willy wonkaaaaaa
oh God no why do they need to ruin everything with remakes
Why so many remixes Cant  anybody invent their own movie What a shame
Im excited for the oompa loompas
Wowthis looks terrible 
I like just about everyone in this
1 It wasnt chocolate that made people float it was fizzy lifting drink  ENDLESS TRASH
No
"Sees title and thumbnail 

Okay you have my curiosity 


Watches the video 

Now you have my attention"
Mathew Baynton Paterson Joseph Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant the director of Paddington  this is gonna be a banger
Happy to see MrBean
Perfect casting great directorits got a chance 3
"Warner Bros has been rancid since last year but this




this had my curiosity But now it has my attention"
Is this sequel or prequel 
Rowan Atkinson was such a surprise Cant wait to see this in cinemas 
"Timothy Chalemet is really good but why And although I saw no song and dance nonsense in the trailers it just reeks of it in all the scenes
I hate musicals"
So is it a full on musical or just kinda dispersed in and out like the original
finally TimmyTims time
I was meh  until I saw Hugh grant when I busted up laughing  Youve got my attention Johnny drop gave quite 5e memorable performance Im interested to see more of this one
Plot Twist the Girl accidentally dies and Wonka goes from funloving  eccentric to a deranged recluse
LGBT2Toaster child groomer
"Quiet up and listen down
I must now use this line

Also its brilliant that this releases 
on Day 42 of Dune 2s Theater Release
only 45 day timefame
1 Chalemet movie followed by a 
second Chalemet movie"
Another POS nobody wanted or asked for Hollywood is dead and good riddance
Alright you got me Im in
waaankaaa
Now this looks like it would be worth seeing
Is that Alan Johnson
I love that the mom from Paddington is in this
Ive never seen so many bot accounts
You had me at chocolate cartel
Definitely gonna be a masterpiece 
Well it definitely seems like an origin story from the original Willy Wonka but Im just saying does anybody not care what Charlie Bucket is doing I mean he won the prize to be the new chocolate mankatha and yet they never continued his story
Hugh Grant baby
OMG this is my favorite movie Im so glad to see this is coming out I still love the original but this one looks awesome Come on Christmas 
I thought this was a joke it first Oh my God I dont know how to feel
Jonka
Nope
I love the British cast
One of the few origin stories thats actually worthwhile and interesting I do find these origin movie titles odd though Why do it always have to be just one word thats part of the characters name Weird trend not terrible just find it amusing Either way looks fun
Please just use the score for the trailers so we dont just get the THX deafening
Astounding I had no idea what to expect from this film and once I saw the trailer it felt so obvious and perfect I havent been this excited for a movie in a while Great work
Why
warner bros having the year of their life
I hated paddington bear as a kid Why do they keep regurgitating all the same stuff over and over this cashing in on nostalgia is getting old AF
High grant was unexpected in the best way possible
At first when I heard about this movie I was like  no one can play kooky Willy Wonka like Johnny  Depp But this looks amazing and I want to see it 
Whats lil Mabu doing in this trailer
Thought this was another Wes Anderson AI Generated Hypothetical Trailer Thats a bit of a mouthful to say out loud
Sold as soon as they said Chocolate Cartel
Meh
Woah
yikes
This is going to be amazing
i woke up this morning and said to myselfwe need another willie wonka moviesaid no one ever
"155 Willy Wonka Mark my words
Genshin Players Vengeance Will Be Mine"
I wish Anthony Hopkins played the Oompa Loompa
Looks good and all but thered better be some Snowpiercer nods
Im something of a magician myself
The Paddington director behind it gives me hope itll be good But unless its an amazing movie I dont think anyone was really asking for a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
God hes just the cutest 
I didnt know Daniel Thrasher was an actor lol
Mr bean am sold
i thought this was a JOKE ur telling me this is an actual movie
Looks better than the Burton version
Creepy
Sally Hawkins 
I like Chalamet but his acting just doesnt feel right here Gene Wilder left awfully big shoes to fill
010 no willy
"This feels weak
Ask The Gods"
OMG YES FINALLY
"Hugh Grant as an Oompa  Loompa KeeganMichael Key as an oldtime police officer Rowan Atkinson as a priest hes always been good at that role and Timothee Chalamet in a top hatI dont now what Im more excited for 
I didnt know Timothee could sing and this looks pretty musical so Im excited for that too"
The Academy please be good to Timmy this time
My childhood x1000
To be honest Ive been nostalgic for 2 days since yesterday by watching clips from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory but suddenly this WONKA movie trailer appears wow it feels like Dejavu man
This actually looks wonderful Children and adults need this 
Is this a joke 
Yeah I think Im gonna pass on this one
I thought this was an SNL sketch
Oh my this looks Wonderful 
One parte Is of 2005 and the other part Is 1971
Aww man Im excited for this  but why did I feel like Daniel Radcliffe could have been amazing as Wonka
Honestly this is great  Maybe we get to see him visiting the oompa loopa lands and meeting them
Okay but why though
This looks like garbage
The first few seconds I wondered if they relocated the factory to Hogwarts and then I see And The Producer of Harry Potter so that question was answered
Great another movie that fat shames todays youth into seeking unattainable beauty standards Goodol Willa Wonka played by a skinny white guy You can always count on him
WONKA A tale of diabetes
This looks really bad
Tom holland as Willy Wonka
Looks great Im in
xD not a chocolate cartel
Timothee Chalamet going from a serious hardcore SciFi film with Dune Part 2 to a light heartwarming holiday fantasy film with Wonka in the span of a month will keep me interested for the end of 2023 for sure
050 Tell me why the actor kinda sounds like Daniel thrasher but its not
Im just happy its not made by Disney
Hmmnot sure
Another project to dump some money in the toilet Didnt know WB had any extra money left
SIgn me up i was scared at first but damn this looks good and the oompa loompas are orange again
As an adult this looks decent though I wasnt sold on chalamets acting in this clip  I dont see kids being into this though My daycare kids and my own kiddo are obsessed with the Johnny depp one
looking forward 
MuadDib and the Chocolate Factory   The Candy Must Flow
Looks good
This is the 3rd movie of Wonka Have we seriously ran out of ideas 
Is Wilbur Wonka gonna be in this
UghI cant stand Chalamet Hes completely wrong for this roll Never gonna watch it
Sorry still prefer the original
An origin story of pure imagination 
Theyre leaning too hard into comedy and not enough into the weird fantasy elements of the other two movies
No
dunno about this
Not the faux southern accent 
How about we stop remaking the same stories over and over again and make movies about new ones Or take a movie that was terrible and remake it if you dont have an idea of your own
WB is incapable of relating to its audience or understanding what it is they think we want to watch Js
MrBean what are you doing 
 If ever anyone needed an example that Pedowood is entirely out of ideas this is the crystalization of that
this is gonna be my joker
Oh dear No
Ugh
Why couldnt we get Kevin Hart as an Oompa Loompa
I ws skeptical when i first heard about this movie but it looks very magical and feelgood Just what i need right now lol
Why cant they just get midgets
Still not sure of Timothee in this role he seems to slip into that NY accent a bit here but the man behind Paddington and Rowan have got my attention
johnny depps wonka was also awesome
INC woke pile of trash
This looks amazing Now lets make Creatures of Conquest 
103 caught me off guard He gonna be the best Priest ever
Look how diverse this movie is They must feel great about themslves
Regardless of how the film looks or feels to me as Hollywood rips out old franchises all the time Having had gene wilder pass away who is easily still the best WONKA Timothy looks like a perfect casting choice as he has the adolescent facial features of a young gene wilder
Havent said NOPE this fast in almost a full year
This just doesnt give any Willy wonka vibes at all
"Just wondering how many people ask for this
Answer EVERYONE WHO SAW THE ORIGINAL MOVIE HAVE BE ASKING FOR THIS MOVIE"
I want chocolate now
Looks boring and with a forced inclusion of a female black character that character should have been played by an Oompa Loompa Also the main character doesnt look weird or menacing just sissy and sensible
Hah  Apakah saya melihat mathilda  
I like the costuming and set design They had an appealing use of color imo
No but this is actually so cute It seems like a really nice movie I cant wait plus its timothee so ofc Im watching
Looks really really bad
Oh look another Hollywood rehash
"Ah Another Willy Wonka 
REIMAGINED   Aggressively socialising Africans and Europeans together as forcefully and desperately as possible Imagine my shock

Who nose which tribe is responsible for this concerted effort to forcefully encourage mixing between these two very different groups"
This might actually be fun
""
This guy just has one of those faces you want to punch
This film gives me the vibe of early 2000s 
Just in Time for awards season
already a classic already a classic
I think casting Timothe Chalamet as wonka is a great idea It makes me reminisce about Johnny Depps character as Willy Wonka
Its another willy Wonka movie 
oh its a musical guess im never seeing it
"At first I watched this expecting just another garbage hollywood remake of an older movie with some kind of agenda shoved in

But after watching the trailer wow This feels like a movie Im definitely going to go and see just lighthearted fun with how Wonka came to be and how he started off Its about time we had a wholesome upbeat movie again among all the action dark and broody and serious movies It gave me the same vibe the Mario movie did simply a fun movie trailer"
Uhhg another unoriginal film
Idk I know all these comments are positive and Im probably gonna get hate but I just dont think that Timothee is a good Wonka I mean Johnny Depp was kinda weird and scary but he was a great wonka Gene Wilder was obviously the best one But Timothee is just nah Only good thing ab this is that Rowan Atkinsons in it
Shut up and tell me where the Ticket is
I love Timmy but just why Hollywood is releasing cringey prequels for absolutely no reason at all 
Is anyone going to make a movie about Charlie as owner of the factory
What just happening
Love Willy Wonka and his story Love people of all colors and creeds Dont iove inserts and retcons to original material that does not belong there though Not just characters but events and additions All are contaminants to me This is probably a nice movie that did not need to get made and will likely not do well Just being honest
I love the old one but I know this is gonna be a great movie
Hollywood has no original ideas anymore Art is dead
Timothe Chalamet will never top Gene Wilders portrayal of Willy Wonka  But I guarantee hell be better than Johnny Depps portrayal
""
I wasnt sold at all until the end THAT was funny
I cant wait to see the part when Wonka goes insane and starts plotting various ways to kill selfish children
If you watch this movie I will kill you
Another Willy wonka movie mmm idk
This looks good 
This looks dreadful
Finally a biopic created as a masterpiece Now tell me if its not that amazing
This looks very promising
Ah i wish they make a part where wonka meet charlie grandpha its better change that girl with him just that who make me dissapointed
are they gonna show the part where willy wonka enslaves a tribe of pigmies lmao
Why did I remember Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory being kind of a horror film
He even bring his own slave
"Me Oh my god can they just leave Willy Wonka alo
Movie Theyve all been crushed by the Chocolate Cartel
Me You have my attention"
I cant wait
For wonkas and gene wilders sakes please be good  anything is better than the god awful Depp version
Why  Serious question
Riddled with blacks 
So its just another timothee looking like timothee
I get the sense hes more of a young Gene Wilder Wonka in this version Im glad
Hollywood is CORNY AF
WE CANT WAITTTTTTTT
Bro that cinematic version of the music got me
This looks absolutely awful Not even close to the magic of Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka
More garbage REMADE
The casting is so 2023 Disney  everything looks so politically correct
How wholesome 
From the director of Paddington A MASTERPIECE IS COMING
i love her lack of energy go girl give us nothing
Que gracia 
Please for this one no LGBTQ stuff Just bring the Magic Back
This looks very interesting movie
Capitalism LOL
Our king returns 
Honestly I love how endearing and comfortable Timothee is in the role Its like he amplifies the feelgood and whimsical tones of the film really well I also like how they showed us that Willy Wonka struggles without shoving it down our throats Cant wait for this
I still miss Johnny Depps version
This looks awful
I cant wait
Im still skeptical but Ill admit that by the end with the Oompa Loompa they had me wanting to see it
I was nervous until I saw Paddington
Film looks like it could be excellent but I do not think Chalamet was the right choice for Wonka Nothing magical about him or his performance
Another remake The original is always the best
Oh Elio
OMG I CANT WAIT
CAN WE NOT PLEASE
Mr beans can speak
Ive never been so ready for anything in my life Unless your talking about the new Barbie movie
I can literally see myself watching this on christmas eve with my family and friends in the dimlit living room enjoying our drinks and chips It makes me excited for Christmas
IM SUPER EXCITED FOR THE MOVIE
I didnt want to like this trailer and I really did Great job
The tagline tho how Willy become Wonka 
"He spends 7 years perfecting his craft 
 dude is 20 years old"
I cant wait to see this
This movies going to be a wonderful journey and I cant wait
Nice
Wow this actually looks like its gonna be good a lot better than anything this year
Just dont do any woke thing here anythings else it will be a childhood memory coming back
""
this looks good actually
England in the Early 20th century checks all the boxesBravo
Timothy did not sound right for the role then I saw him and thought wait a second he actually looks pretty good as a young Willy Wonka and then he opened his mouth and I thought yep nope I was right 
IS THAT ALAN JOHNSON
""
This is giving Disney live action remake energy
50 years ago I saw the original version of Willy Wonka and it seems to me that this one does not ask for anything I think Im going to Love 
this is the worst film ever made
Conflicted I did not like this trailer at all But I know Paddington is great and I liked the tagline How Willy Became Wonka I think thats genius but the whole tone is not working for me
Heres a movie that no one asked for
Looks great I shouldnt have watched the whole trailer though
Whywhywhy not something original Whyyyyyyy
Couldnt even make it through the trailer
Looks good Reminds me of Jingle Jangle  the Greatest Showman 
Excited to see this Seems like a really charming film
Do we honestly need an origin story for Willy Wonka
I hate how Willy Wonka looks so much like Karl from Mr beast
I thought it was gonna be another remake Im so happy its a different story It looks really cute 
A movie no one asked for with a comment section full of big tiddy robots telling me its gonna be amazing Oddly similar to the last crappy trailer I watched Would of preferred him working on the Dune movies more instead of wasting time tryna out Wonka Johnny Depp in another souless reboot
This is going to flop big time Chalamet is a completely overrated shithouse actor and his Willy Wonka is so flat and vapid that I cant believe he was cast in the first place
"OMG just how many iterations of Wonka are we going to have to endure How many ways are there to tell this story It has now joined the ranks of the many monsters that Hollywood couldnt kill eg Frankenstein Dracula Werewolf Jason etc etc etc 

Only Santa should be revisited each year"
"Do they seriously think they have breathe life into every dying franchise 
Not like they could take inspiration from existing properties and make something original 
No that would take actual writing  

Prediction this will be every whimsical outcast trying to prove themselves story in every prequel origin story"
I nearly broke my jaw when I saw the OG Oompa Loompa
Timothee Chalamet thats all I need to see watching this for sure grew up when the first one came out with Gene Wilder My favorite childhood movie
Theres no blackies Im woka world
I knew the tag scene would be an oompa loompa fr
Ladies gentlemen and noble person I present to you the next Tumblr sexyman
oooothis gonna be good
Bro wtf is this Twinky Wonka and the shtstck factory
TOTAL GARBAGE
"At first was like
Oh no
But then i was like
Oh wait this i like

Its an orgin An im for it"
Hugh Grant OMGoodnessthis looks sweet
Oh my gosh i cant wait to see wonka with my sister
""
Based on this it looks like it captures the feel of the original
Who is this movie for Hollywood is on crack
Yes Im so seeing this
This made me irritated 
i love this already welp xd
Timothy completely miscast
Cant believe they cast Karl as Mr Beast in this Feastables documentary
"Sigh It better be good cause I was obsessed with Tim Burtons remake of the Classic Charlie movie
Lol  Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Epic"
Im sorry but this is horribly cast Nothing about Timothy is remotely Wonka like Hes not quirky or fun hes bland unemotive and unconvincing No amount of CGI can cover up the lack of talent
Wow I never considered it before but he makes a perfect Wonka
"I was skeptical when this film was first announced but I now have to admit that this look scrumdiddlyumptious 

I just hope it has the wallpaper where the snozberries taste like snozberries"
102 and MR BEAN became a great priestpope
Literally no one asked for this
they just had to have a joo playing wonka
Ok why isnt Johnny Depp wonka 
The only way to make this worse is to put zendaya in it
Willy Wonka is supposed to be a horror movie
oooh fun
This looks stupid
Its too late Ive already started dancing we cant stop now
I grew up rewatching the original movie countless times so this hits home in such a good way
"Ohhhhooooo
The OG Oompa Loompas"
nice
This movie has already been made twice Make something original you clowns
Another remake
A nice entertaining movie to watch around Christmas time Sounds Good
It doesnt look that good
Im sold
The third Is there going to be a eighth in many years
005 Im something of an inventor myself  
"did anyone wonder what happened before CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLAT FACTORY
 i do
 AND YOU"
Ummm
Rowan Atkinson is that you 142
Chlamet is a decent actor But this is gonna flop You can tell hes acting He doesnt seem like a natural for the role
You know what they say 3rd time the charm Lets see if this movie will be good
"every time he speaks I think hes going to talk in a british accent
i think i prefer the british accent but this is okay as well"
Great trailer bro This looks good hopefully it is as good as Paddington 2
The Hugh Grant reveal should have been kept for the movie Stop giving everything away in trailers Hollywood
Someone ought to tell Paul Atreidess twin here that his offplanet brother is in desperate need of resources and military assistance
He does NOT give willy Wonka vibes at all
MR BEAN IS HERE DOING A CAMEO
Hopefully Ill be getting my golden movie ticket by Christmas  
Is this supposed to be a prequel to the 1970s one 
Where is johnny depp and charlie
SoWonka Begins
Ey hold up did i see Mr Bean running 
"Think of something new Hollywood Why SO MANY Wonka movies
Its so weird"
Literally 99 of people ignore this message God save you and your family from the diseases 
how are there 2 types of ooppma loompas
I wish he would do Gene Wilders subtly insane Wonka not Johnny Depps absolutely nutty overthetop version he just doesnt sell it for some reason Hes a cute actor with nice hair but his attempts to act like Johnny Depp are offputting Its the subtlety of Gene Wilders performance that made the audience ask Is he insane or is he a genius That made the Willy Wonka character so interesting and memorable and as terrible as the remakes are Wilder is the reason why the remakes exist
Dont know just seems like a kid thats trying to act like an older man
Rowan Atkinson
This looks cute and good Ill watch it but I dont think its gonna be as good as the other two
Excuse me but its 
Cant wait to see how the woke have ruined this classic
Its mr bean Yay
Is Willy Wonka magical
Bro this is way better than I thought it would be I thought it was like a movie made by a young director and not a big budgetbut Omg insane directors and ROWAN ATKINSON
Wrong casting on Wonka
Chalamet is the most unconvincing Wonka possible The film is saved only by the spirit of Paddington
its giving yikes and cringe because timothee looks so unnatural as wonka he shoudve never been cast
You had me at Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa
Im glad they took a different path with the plot in this film and didnt try to remake the movie It would be hard to top Johnny Depps performance But this looks good Im excited to check it out Timothee was a good choice
i just wish we get more lore about the oompa loompas
Cant lie Im not feeling it
Sally Hawkins plays the perfect mom Loved her in Paddington cant wait to see her performance in this Even if its minor
GO SEE SOUND OF FREEDOM INSTEAD OF THIS GARBAGE
5810
Damn these Hollywood executives have really ran out of original ideas
Key is hilarious hes gonna steal the show
Omg its gonna flop so hard
Who else just got done Wonkin dey Willy to this trailer
Woah this cast
No I dont like It
chocolate rain
I think Ill stick to Tim Burtons Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Ill give them credit for not making Wonka balck
The original with Gene Wilder was pure magic when I was a kid The one with Johnny Depp sucked This doesnt look much better
Wait Mr Bean is also in this movie thats great
Hes 15 years old  and travelled the world the last nearly 10 years in search of chocolate stuff  so since he was 5  Cmon be real
No
"Come on how can you improve on the 1971 version starring Gene Wilder Jack Albertson and Peter Ostrum as Charlie Charlies kind heartedness and Gene Wilders eccentricity made for a memorable movie experience  When Charlie opens the wrapper a little and glimpses the golden ticket  I was so happy for him that scene was so well done Great Movie

TImothy doesnt seem quirky enough or charismatic enough to keep the audience interested  Hope I am wrong and this version is a big hit"
Guess all the black people left the neighborhood when Willy Wonka got older 
Hollywood make an original property challenge impossible To be fair this doesnt look bad but please stop with the remakes and reboots
This looks really really good
Johnson from Peep Show Im sold
Great cast but I dont hold high hopes for this Too bad Christopher Lee isnt there to be the creepy dentist dad again P
"Thus completes the Willy Wonka Saga
Wonka Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Snowpiercer
Youre welcome"
Im not gonna lie at first I clicked on this real pessimistic like who asked for this  but this trailers really brought me around  theres a real sense of just fun and whimsy I wasnt expecting
I was getting some heavy Harry Potter vibes and then they hit me with Producer of Harry Potter Go figure
A willy wonka prequel movie is a great idea and Timothy Chalmet playing a young version of the character was fantastic casting Also Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is something I never thought would work so well
I hope this movie ends with Willy devising up the plan for the golden ticket and releasing them out to the world teasing Charlie
I hate the idea of Wonkas past being explored that terrible Johnny Depp version is a nice example of that but this one has my curiosity
Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant I love it already  Paddington was such a good movie I just know the storytelling will be great 
I cant believe Matthew Baynton is in this movie I grew up with horrible histories so its great to see him back
SUPER FLOP
From the producers of Harry Potter Im definitely watching
Its a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate factorys iconic Willy Wonka its Timothee Chalamet and it was produced by the producer of Harry Potter Im watching this as soon as it comes out
Smash or Pass
Seeing wherever this movie takes place 100 made me replay to see if that Snowpiercer theory was true 
"Once i saw MrChalamet i knew this was going to be a great movie
Ive watched Dune 10 times nowhe is an outstanding actor"
The famous Willy Wonka returns with an origin of his story
Looks pants 
I think Timothee has embodied the Wonka character very well The amount of energy that he has to tell his story is incredible and this movie is already a masterpiece and storytellerdriven Im actually excited for this film to come out
I dunno Im just not buying Chalamets Wonka for some reasonIll still go see it of course hopefully he surprises me
Wonka
 Mr Bean 
"cast of paddington making a wonka movie

seriously didnt know i really needed this yessss we do"
I guess this would be the woke version of Willy Wonka 
Not sure i feel about Timothee Chalamet as Wonka but who knows it might be real good
For a second there I thought Wonka was being played by a familiar surgeon
Milk it until it moos
This looks like so much fun especially seeing Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa
Johnny Depp
My favorite part was when Wonka snaps the neck of an Oompa Loompah and yells ITS GOBSTOPPING TIME
Its a surprise for me to learn that there were so many black people lived in England in early 20th century 
who up wonkin they willy rn
I thought this was gonna be the musical when he said Scratch that reverse it Disappointed
I would have liked to go see this movie at the cinema at Christmas 
Wonka The Chocolate maker
The choc must flow
Im getting a lot of Harry Potter lol and I like it
First its Napoleon now its Wonka WTF is going on Banger after banger
Not even 5 seconds in timothy acting doesnt fit Wonkaits like an emo kid trying to be a cool football guy
At first I was skeptical now im intrigued
This willy Wonka movie seems less sinister than the previous ones and im here for it
this is cool and all but why is there a third willy wonka movie being remade
Not sure Chalamet has the whimsy for this role but Paddington was a blast so I am hopeful
"So the extended trilogy is this Charlie and the chocolate factory and snow piercer Got it

Look up the Wonka snow piercer theory its probably wrong but super cool"
Hopefully it is better than that ghastly Johnny Depp mess Tim Burton did ages ago
Doesnt have the charisma to play Wonka
NO NO NO
Our culture has reached a dead end Everything is recycled
Oompa Oompahehe
If there isnt a black non binary character i aint watching
Why
Pass
MATT 
feel good garbage with a hint of woke
Timothy
So whos the little girl how does she fit into the story
Jesus this looks so bad and of course the replacement of Charlies has to be black and a girl Becouse female empowerment  yall
aiight aiight i am actually excited and looking forward to seeing this prequel ever since the original i always wanted the proper story of how he got his start
"005
Norman Osborne Im something of a scientist myself"
Didnt think Id be interested but I AM
Definitely for kids thats OK The last part with the UmpaLumpa made me laugh
Oh no no no no no no please stop Warner Bros
Enough with the reboots Hollywood try something different
How many times are they going to remake this movie No original scripts
Iooks terribIe 
I hope they include his dad as the oppressive dentist
Thank god Depp is not this
I cant believe youve managed to miss the mark this greatlythis looks worse than the Johnny Depp one
Mr Bean  I cant wait for Christmas
Its been a while since a movie gave me a sense of childhood wonder
Garbage
Johny depp still better
Hes giving me jonah from superstore vibes haha
Looks like the perfect movie for Christmas
This looks really wholesome and proper for Christmas time The men and old women mad in the comments please shut up youre not the target audience
Nothing like the book Okay why I had so high hopes for this And I love Chalamet but he simply doesnt have that Willy Wonka energy
Dumb
So excited for this
Seems alright I feel like I can play a better willy wonka than timothee though
141 MrBean
They had me in the first 10 seconds when they played the beginning of Pure Imagination 
More woke driveltheres nothing like the original Jesus can someone come up with an original script Perhaps just do the Wilder version with an all urban cast And film it in Harlem
I will be seated and accounted for
I cant wait to watch this film
Well they got their Grammy requirement covered Lets see how woke dark chocolate can be
""
MR BEAN
Wonka movie sounds and looks greatApplaud to the director casts and all the people behind the scene for this amazing adaptation of Willy Wonka I really anticipate this
This looks terrible
Another Wonka movie but they wont do the glass elevator Why
I like chalamet but he does not fit this role at all
107 is that normal pooing youre doing
This is perfect replica of the classic Will Wonka from his past and the respect from the original movie RIP Gene Wilder
Jesus this looks wonderful Timothee Chalmet is one of the most talented actors on the planet right now
More like wanka
Okay Paddington is fine but is it the same director as Paddington 2
Every movie commercial and ads have a token Black now This is getting ridiculous and ruined diversity
I couldve done without the child sidekick Im interested in Wonka not some unnecessary tagalong
"Im in
 Looks like a great Christmas time movie"
How woke will this movie be
Proof that cosplay doesnt equal acting ability
My favourite part was when he got his wand out and shouted its wonka time
Meh 
"WONKA sounds a lot like WANKA 
"
mathew and simon 
I am looking forward to see the movie Nice to see Rowan Atkinson in this movie too However why are you refering also the 1971 movie rather than the book After all Roald Dahl was not that pleased with that adaptation
Please stop the remakes
And this is the story of how Wonka became the cartel himself
The cast omg
Looks cool and all but why so many remakes 
Willy W
"I think they should remake The Little Mermaid 
Its been at least two minutes since the last one came out"
this looks amazing Timothe never disappoints
Look  pretty goodthe trailer reminds me of Jingle Jangle which I thoroughly enjoyed
nice
Why does Hollywood keep re making the same movie over n over n over n over n over
This has made me excited for this movie
Garbage
deep fake deaged Jack Albertson appearing or what
I hate it already Will probably watch and then curse myself for not listening to my gut
yeah im going to see it  hugh grant as an oompaloompa sold it for me
LOVE
This looks charming which is a shame I  was ready to hate it 
White savior for a black girl I can get behind that premise
This is cute but the original and Johnny Depp version will always have a place in my heart I cant wait to see this remake wow words I never thought I would say 
This looks terrible lmao
timmy how tf am i supposed to wait until decemeber
So is this the prequel to Depps or Wilders Willy Wonka character The beginning music through me off with Wilders song
So is Timothy Chalamee spelling The neww Johnny Depp 
NOW CHOP
Looks stupid and woke
Looks terrible 
I know what happens It turns out that the young black lady invented everything And the white Willy Wonka stole it Hes a bad Willy Wonka and she comes in to save the World
Theyre making another one
Wonder how many kids wanka is going to kll in this one
dark white nutty absolutely insane
Sorry Wonka Oompa Loompa stole your scenes
PLEASE
Is it just me or does something feel off Like they are trying to make it magical and special and it just feels forced Timothy doesnt seem super authentic to me
This look more magical and original than the last flicks Disney has been releasing
Howd they turn Willy Wonka British but without British actors
I smell another boxoffice flop for WB
I hope they have pure imagination
Reboot Fatigue
Disaster in the making
Johnny deep is really a legend to play this role
""
I cant tell if the comments about Paddington are joking or if its actually unironically really good I did go to see Paddington at the cinema around Christmas in 2014 but I dont remember much about it
I can guess the credit scene of this movie either he meet the peoples that got the tickets or meet his dad
"022
what"
Paul King Joby Talbot Neil Hannon and Timothe Chalamet being involved give me some hope But it doesnt look like it has any of the edge of the Gene Wilder movie  replaced it with yet more CGI apparently
I have such mixed feelings about this
Severely unpopular opinion but this doesnt look too great Wonka was eccentric zany random and witty in the 71 version Being younger I expected even more of that here but this personality seems dull compared to Wilders or Depps versions Maybe the trailer doesnt showcase that and hopefully Im wrong
Now this just looks like a nice wholesome good movie No wokeness no hidden agenda Im really looking forward to this
This is going to be fun to watch
To be honest Im surprised no one has ever considered making Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator the lesser known sequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory into a film
This looks really bad tbh
What a sight Mr Bean141
Judging by the looks of that Oompa Loompa in that jar I could see that theyre sticking more with the 1970s version of Willy Wonka But I aint complaining this looks promising
i love timothee but idk abt this one guyss
2023 is the year random stuff like this can and most likely will be big hits
I remember when everyone had doubts about this and was wondering why were we getting it This trailer is so damn good and I had no idea it was from the person behind Paddington Cant wait to see this
The set looks similar to fantastic beast
Almost makes you forget Wonka becomes a reclusive shut in to protect his recipes
All I see is regulus black as Willy Wonka
Omg I remember seeing Timmy in his Wonka outfit when photos of the movie being shot were out back in 2021 or something and now its finally here
Tim is giving off major Daniel Thrasher vibes and I love it
Why so many black people
A prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 
No Just no
Wtf is being called something of a magician 
"This actually looks good
But ofc no one will beat Johnny and especially not Gene

Scratch that Reverse it
Someone better give Gene his royalities"
If you wanna view paradise I have to see this
Looks fun Johnny ate the whole role with no cumbs left left though
The original with Gene wilder will always be the best But I am intrigued
at least its not another remake
Its gonna Flop i guarantee
Okay you won me over Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Finally some creativity from Hollywood
That mfer grandpa joe better not be in this
No daydreaming penalty 3 that actually made me laugh Lmaooo imagine if we had to pay money every time we daydreamed Id be out of every last penny of mine
Already a better Willy Wonka than Johnny Depp
Ok im excited AF 
Not a fan of horror movies but this looks good
This looks dreadful
Idk This doesnt look like what i hoping for Kinda looks cheesy Wonka is a cool character that gotta do him justice it literally looks exactly like Paddington bear and i dont think that matches Wonkas Character
I saw MrBean and I am sold
Looks like 
Looks delicious and I hope it will not disappoint as whole chocolate in the theaters
Noooo I prefer the Tim burton lore of Willy wonks
More hot garbage
starting to regret watching the trailer now I have to wait HALF A YEAR for this
Pretty sure every positive comment with an emoticon at the end is a bot
So I guess Hollywoods been afraid of fresh ideas for decades
The title of the trailer had me thinking this was going to be a complete wasted addition to Wonka movies An origin movie that looks like this with this cast and this production team actually looks like it could be a great addition Looking forward to it
I dont why but 019 to 023 has me dying I dont think Ive seen Timothe with a role like this
HARD WONKIN PASS
I was sceptical at first but this actualy looks good and its from the one that made paddington so it has ti be great
look good and make you goosebumps
This trailer gives me strong Dolittle vibes and I hope theyre wrong
MR BEAN WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE
I just know that one TikTok Wonka hella salty he didnt get this role 
Diversity  Zoomer Tiktoker lead role  Mostly CGI  2023 Movie 
It has the look of Oliver Twist Not too shabby and curious to see this interpretation of Willy Wonka given its meant to be a prequel
What a legendary cast When you see Matthew Baynton from Horrible Histories you know this movies going to be a classic
Man this young Wonka definitely channels Genes Wonka very well Definitely looking forward to this movie
Looking forward to it 
Love the American accent for this british film
looking GREAT  feeling EXCITED for this movie
Why do I keep seeing Daniel Thrasher instead of Timothee Chalamet lmfao
2023 filmmaking has taken a step in the right direction films were originally so dark but now the darkness has been taken away and light and high definition has been restored This film looks great and casting Timothee Chalamet and Keegan Michael Key ensure this film will be good as they are great improvisers
"Oompa Loompa Doompa Di Do Here is the Wonka trailer for you
Oompa Loompa Doompa Di Date
Well I must say this movie looks great"
Mr BEEEAAAANNN
damn they showed too much
OMG the dancing at the end makes me wanna see the movie XD
oh god i hope hover choc is the worst name they have come up with
I spent the last 7 years deleting my history
Seems very disneyfied 
Ahhh me emociona tanto nunca me he perdido ninguna participacin de Timi 
This is gonna suuuuuuuk
I hope they do a charlie and the chocolate factory afterwards
This cast is incredible 
Who is the girl supposed to be The ending was the best part
53 years later still making movies with this idea Incredible
forced racial integration kind of ruins the story
I was just about to say why another Wonka movie But this looks like so much fun
Hugh Grant looks great in it  Other than that not needed  Pass
No daydreaming I must be in North Korea
cant wait
Im no really feeling Tim as Willy
No thanks
seriously we already had an adaptation that wasnt long ago
Looks terrible in 5 seconds
Clearly a lot of social engineering in the casting tick boxes
Bit apprehensive about the girlboss sidekick attached to his hip but willing to give it a shot if the director of Paddington is behind it
Its Matt from horrible histories 
Im in 100 
Can we stop ruining movies
Isnt there a movie coming out too about the back story of Augustus Gloop An English comedian named Wang says he will be in it
Ah an add on to the horror movie Charlie and the chocolate factory
Beats the other remake 
   
This looks like an SNL skit Wow
The trailer had me 5 seconds in lost me around a minute in and brought me back at 207 This could either be really good or really bad due to craming in too many plot points
Where is johnny depp
Yes sir
So excited to hear the Umpa Loompa song
Ruined it completely
Yknow when I first heard about this movie Ill admit I rolled my eyes but after seeing this trailer I might give it a shot
Kind of getting tired of all these movies from every studio just being repeats with some tweaks Is it too much to ask for original ideas
So PC
"Still not grasping it They made willy the good guy I guess they havent read either of the books Hes anything but a good guy 
Still its nice to see they woked up the biggest slave owner in kids literature Thats always something"
Let me guess hes been reimagined to be a polyseccual 2 Spirit Otherkin to appeal to modern audiences
Johnny Depp best Willy wonka
ii was about to say oh boy here we go again another reboot of the book but this this just blew me away i gotta see this it looks awesome and mr bean is in it lol
Lowkey missed Johnny Depp Still the movie would be amazing just a little part still misses the old Wonka
MRBEAN
Im guessing this takes place in Austria Hungary
For the love of god can we start getting original ideas again ugh
Spoiler the kid got fired and the ommpa loompa takes everyones job lol
IM SEATED
Idk a large part of what made the OG Wonka so appealing is the mystique behind him You never knew what he was capable of and maybe an origin story isnt the best Hoping wrong though 
Putting this on my Christmas list D
Okay sounds fun
"Omg
This looks horrible 
Sorry
I watched the trailer twice "
This looks just as bad as the last reboot
Timothe Chalamet served a fresh face for the young Wonka but I miss the quirkiness of Johnny Depps portrayal of the role And lets talk about Hugh Grant as the Umpa Lumpa 
Timothee Chalemet is MISCAST He has no idea how to play this part Its like hes reading the lines off a teleprompter His eyes are completely dead Poor thing He actually thought he was a real actor
Who knew 19th century England was full of black people
This looks like trash
Paused the credits bit and thats a pretty awesome list of UK comedians  its got to be worth watching
The setting looks so plain unlike the other story you guys are getting bored like famous people are just good at being famous other people that arent famous would make an amazing movie
Looks good   
Hmm 
It doesnt look right a movie based in the early 1900s for blk people to be lead characters in a non struggle movie
Here we go Mama
I was always wondering how a prequel to willy wonka describing his origin would be like Now after seeing this I am fully onboard now This looks absolutely amazing Cant wait to see this in theaters
Its always mysterious to me how remakes are decided And if im not just imagining it it seems like the influence of Harry Potter the series set design and FX has spread widely in the industry
Eu esperei tantos anos para ter 2 filme
i didnt cared about the movie when it was announced but it has peaked my curiosity
Chalomet seems completely out of place He looks like theres an actual eccentric person on set and hes just copying them
I will watch this purely for Hugh grant as an oompa loompa
It was only a matter of time Im not dissapointed im happy its about his story and not a remake
I was about to downvote and flame this movie for not having Oompa Loompas but they redeemed themselves
Looks fun
A prequel 
Finally an Oompa Loompa that looks like an Oompa Loompa
THIS LOOKS SO EPIC
If we get a nod to the WeasleyWonka theory Im in
They just put him in because hes famous  the movie seems so sarcastic and whos the black girl with him like what the storys dont match this just seems so random 
Who up wonkin they willy right now
Props to them for paying tribute to the real Wonka and not the Johnny Depp atrocity
L reremake
As long as Depp isnt in itIm happy
Please not another one I am so sick of all the sequels and spinoffs I swear that if there were 15 big budget movies for the year 2023 13 of them are spin offs and sequels 
I would watch this just to see Hugh Grant as a dancing oompa loompa
This looks so good Def a masterpiece
Tim 
Mathew Baynton MATHEW BAYNTON
Stop ruining our childhood
I never thought Id see an Oompa Loompa cast as Hugh Grant striking a stripper pose 
Can we just stop this
Did they need to cgi the oompa Lompas Couldnt thet get actual little people
What Ive been waiting for 
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is worth the ticket price alone
Cool
I loved the part where he said Its Wonka time 
Rowan Atkinson is Back
the first one was made in 1971 and the second one was made in 2005 but this one is coming soon in this year 2023 ant thats all i have to say now
IM LITERALLY CRYING RN
worst casting for wonka he is a terrible actor
"Ngl Tim doesnt strike me as a Willy Wonka I dont think hes suited to play wacky children characters 
His face compliments a more serious character with a more serious movie tone

Its like imagine Keanu Reeves or Christian Bale or Robert De Niro acting in a PG movie imagine Keanu Reeves as Willy Wonka lmaoo"
Boring
Wow A film that is actually original and not just a remake
Another unnecessary revamp No thanks
In terms of remakes Willy Wonka is the Spiderman of the candymaking cinematic universe
Damn wanted to see the golden ticket remake
Im see Mr Bean 
Oh When I saw who his mother was I burst into tears How lovely
All im thinking about is dune
"wait wait wait is it a prequel to the 1971 movie
O"
Cant wait lets go 
Timothee Chalametwas Edwards son Edgar and now he is Willy wonka I would like to see him work together with Johnny Depp and tim burton
Im actually interested mostly because of Timothy Chalamet I think he will bring a lot to this movie
I am beyond excited for this I cant wait
Hes no Gene Wilder
Cant wait 
Olivia and Sally 
Too much Spice in this kids head
Looking forward to seeing Timothee Chalamet performance as Willy Wonka hopefully he will better than Johnny Deep as Deep was awful
No Depp no me
LMAOO IM IN FOR HUGH OOMPALOOMPA AND MR BEAN PRIEST
Thank you for uploading this trailer in 4K and with subtitles I hope to see more movie companies do the same
The chocolate cartel 
Timothee Chalamet but with Daniel Thrasher energy Thisll be interesting
Parecia uma boa ideia
more s in hollywood please Theres not nearly enough nepotism
Please tell me this means theyll bring back Wonkas candies to promote the movie
Its giving me Greatest Showman vibes and Im here for it
Please god no more remakes universes IP squeezes We are tired so very tired
People arent hating this as much as I thought they would
Yep im definitely watching this been a fan since i was little can already tell this is gonna be incredible
definitely  wonkin his willy
Evil cannot create
too late ive started dancing now hahahha
this seems like it was made by a 13 year old girl who never saw her dad one day in her life
Waiting for Napoleon and Dune part 2
somebody hook up a turbine to Gene Wilder so we can harness all that energy
Timothy seems too normal for Wonka
Bruh I thought they will cast Wonka as Black
Even the trailer is bad quality I think Warner should fire all his staff and rehire it is trash after trash project 
And the story of OSHA violations begins
Given how far Roald Dahl went to protest the source movie he would definitely despise this no matter what even if it is successful regardless
I know this will be amazing bc Timmy is acting in this
The cocoa mist flow
Charlies factory type
Thats Christmas entertainment sorted 
Never thought I would hear the words Chocolate and Cartel in the same sentence
Wow this looks terrible
Wonkar the white chocolate factory
Hard core mixed feelings
LETS GO My childhood is back
Wait did I just saw MR BEAN
Im so excited bc Timothe Chalamet is acting as wonka
OF COURSE his daughter is black
So when does he start killing kids like in the Gene Wilder version
This just made me smile Another version of Willy Wonka for this newer generation but also a sense of nostalgia for the older generations 
DUNE 2 LOOKS INSANE
Why
Im so excited to watch Willy Wonka vs The Chocolate CARTEL
Lots of good actors but this looks terrible Boring Why do they keep remaking this story
Looks like Willy Wonka is getting played pretty straight unlike both Gene and Jonnies version which will be a mistake
Again
There is only one Willy Wonka  Mr Johnny Depp 
Johnny Depp is still the greatest
Feel like the trailer is super spoilery
this is gonna be meme fuel
I dont understand why people are so mad at this Wonka 2023 is a prequel from Wilders Willy Wonka Leave Timothe alone
No
this one looks like it makes up for the WHAT did we just watch dahls approved version of charlie and the chocolate factory and yes i am also a fan of the original more THIS made my holiday list
This would be great except it doesnt capture the tone the other two had  Willy Wonka was not this likable from what I rememberquite scary in fact
Im actually super excited about this I love The OG Willy Wonka movie so I hope this one does well
SERIOUSLY WRITE SOMETHING NEW WITH NEW CHARACTERS AND PAY YOUR DAMN WRITERS
I cant wait to see this movie
goddamnit i was really hoping it would have been like an adult version of wonka ughhhhhhhh defs not watching this
From when you say nothing at all to oompa loompa what the fudge HAHAHA HughGrant
The actor as Willy Wonka was bad choice And againtoo woke This is another flop for the studios
The way i SCREAMED when I saw Matthew Baynton
Make a new movie FFS
a willy wonka origin story just summarizes everything wrong with movies these days
im not sold im honestly not sure ill watch it at the moment im so tired of people just making big budget fanfiction give me something NEW
Im sorry to be a downer but do we really need another Willy Wonka movie
This could be great knowing its being made by the director of Paddington but giving Willa Wonka a strong American accent is and will always be a cardinal sin
put johnny depp as the father watch the box office go boom
WAS THAT MRBEAN
Did I just saw Mr Bean and the guy from Paddington Yep im in 
Uhh Willy Wonka is characterised as an eccentric madman isolated from society in his alien wonderland for years pursuing the ultimate feats of confectionary and childlike wonder to the point that to outsiders he becomes deeply unsettling with an almost dangerous lack of social skills This doesnt look like any of that This looks like lol Im insane want some chocolate Not looking forward to this at all
So Chocolate the movie meets The Greatest Showman
Omg the cast I love Paddington and all those actors are some of my favorites If this is as wholesome and fun as the paddington movies then this will be a big success
For anyone interested The real Willie Wonka was a gunner in a b17 in world War 2 Willard J Willie Wonka Im a Wonka myself Hes my great great uncle We know the writer of Willy Wonka was in the British air force Its quite the coincidence When the original movie came out Willard passed candy out at schools and our family used to get calls all the time because people saw Wonka in the yellow pages lol
Wonka makes candy    
Lmao this is gonna be terrible
Magnifique 
Too late Ive started dancing now Once we started we cant stop I cant wait to see this movie
Thank you for not blackwashing the film 
Again
Looks like MuadDib got too much spice last night
"Im gonna say something unrelated 














Milk"
Oh look its another remake do writersproducers even have any original ideas these days   I guess its easier to just keep milking those popular cash cows
Looks like a fun movie The Oompa Loompa scene tho
Perfect WONKA
Marauders editors are going to go wild with this new material
Imagine Daniel Thrasher as Willy Wonka
This guy doesnt have the charm of the guy in the original wonka movie he just looks like a highschool boy And why was there so scene of the chocolate factory in the trailor  looks like a totally different movie
I cant wait I was a little skeptical at first but I think Im going to like it  We need something uplifting and magical again
Really great month for movies Wonka Godzilla Minus One and Aquaman
this has a completely different feel than with Johnny Depp but Im excited
This movie looks wonderful But I do think he was miscast or needed a voice coach if not none of these whimsical lines sound authentic with his delivery T He looks the part enough but his voice is so corny and too modern
Sally Hawkins was amazing in Spencer Im so excited that shes in this
Timothy already looks like an absolute failure of the character Hes not goofy or cynical enough to play Wonka Cant wait to see this flop harder than Neymar
Hmmm could be worth seeing More origin tale with a touch of rewrite rather than the Gene Wilder or Johnny Depp trying to find an heir versions The scenery is definitely up there on quality
so willie wonka is a small businessman challenging a dystopian corporate monopoly to eventually become a chocolate magnate himself
Looks good but not great  Looks very comedic and goofy and I kinda wanted more dramatic More of a darker tone for a backstory But Ill give it a try
this looks appallingly bad
This looks like a wholesome masterpiece I hope its just as good as the trailer suggests 
why dont his lips sync
This movie looks stupid
Hopefully not as insane as the Johnny Depp version
This movie looks stupid
Doesnt seem like an unpredictable obsessed chocolatier to me
This movie looks stupid
 wtf is this
CANT WAITTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT
No
This movie looks stupid
Horrible casting Love Timothee in other roles This What a mess
Why does this need to exist
Just realized how great jhonny  been missed
Im not buying him as Wonka at all
Paul wake up stop trippin on melange we got a universe to burn
"Timothee Chalamet
KeeganMichael Key
Sally Hawkins
Olivia Colman
Rowan Atkinson
Jim Carter
Hugh Grant

What are the odds"
No new ideas check
Oh look another pass
Cant wait for Twitter to blow tf up and think JK Rowling is making money off this movie 
No one can beat Johny Depp   as Willy Wonka 
Nawww Mathew Baynton from Horrible Histories is in this lets gooooo 
Wth is this 
Art direction and costume Oscars in the bag
Im so happy to see Mr Carson again the rest of trailer seems to be OK
Cant wait to see it
It seems like hes doing a johnny depp impression when he should be doing a gene wilder impression
Omg  can anyone create their own stories anymore Rehash bull 
Lets give it up for Hollywood Shamelessly remaking every classic into their own vision full of their own messages We are entering the dark ages of our time Creativity is dwindling the rich are tirelessly feeding on our weakness and providing foundations for their children We will find our own end sooner than we think Wake up
Im not sure he was the right one for this part Something is way off
Sure
This young actor is not selling it
FIGURES THEY GOTTA GO A CHANGE EVERYTHING AND RUEING OUR CHILDHOODS JUST LIKE LITTLE MERMAID CANCELWONKA
lol so random   
When I saw this pop up I was very skeptical  Now that I watched it Im actually very curious about it
"Gene did great in the first movie 
Johnny great in the remake 
Do we need this"
This looks dumb a f and I like the Willy Wonka movies
Not for me but you guys do you
oompa  loompa  origin  story 
I spent the last 7 years says the NEPO Baby
Nah sick of the forced inclusion EZ pass
Rhino Stew is going to have a field day trying to continue his Snowpiercer theory after this 
Yeah its a nah from me
Why would you use the term cartel and chocolate together in a movie of Willy Wonka 
 boooooooo
Why tho
Looks like another Willy W with too much CGI
Me two minutes into the video BUT WHERE ARE THE OOMPA LOOMPAS OH there they are there they are
him not having the british accent is severely throwing me off
Looks horrible too much CGI especially the oopa you can tell the effects are poorly designed 
Id rather stick to the Johnny depp version
I thought they said this guy is a good actor Hes doing theater acting
Oh this is an origin story
Geeeezzzz  ALREADY ANOTHER KINDA HARD TO UPSTAGE GENE OR JOHNNY I WONT WASTE MY TIME ON IT
Love how Shabnam from EE is killing it with these supporting roles
to be honestthey should have never remade it with Johnny deppi really donrt need a 3rd wonka movie
the Closed Caption at 001 got be dead bruh
 
"I dont care for this


Yet my son and daughter will so

4 tickets please"
Woke as expected
Omg Im so ready
This looks so cute i wish they would do more prequels instead of all these remakes and sequels
oh boy another friggin remake
Yikes  Surprised Wonka isnt black honestly
Looks wholesomeeyes narrow TOO wholesome
Its Alan Johnson
Wont be the same without Johnny feel like Willy Wonka will not give off his signature vibe
107 Is thatnormal chocolate youre making It doesnt look normal 
The seems like it would make more sense as a sequel than a prequel
Imagine casting white bread as fizzy lifting drink 
This better have a sad ending with the chocolate cartel stealing his recipes and him closing down the factory locking himself with the umpas so therell be a part two
Wow This looks incredible and exciting
I didnt think the remakes could get worse We were very content with the jonny depp version
Dune The Prequel
Timothee fits the character so much
Woker
Why didnt they use Johnny Depp to play the role 
He doesnt look like he fits the role Hes a terrific actor but hes forcing the performance
Whoa Lil Mabu looks great as the young Willy Wonka
More woke nonsense Go woke go broke
So many black but no asian and latino We need diversity
The Ommpa Loopa tastes like Ommpa Loopas The snozberries tastes like snozberries Hugh Grant as a Ommpa Loopahahaha
Pass
Cute and British 
Keegan 
"This is one of the reasons why the reasoning of why are they even making this can be right or wrong
A lot of beloved movies roles and remakes were lambasted before they even released footage
Carpenters The Thing Ledgers Joker Battlestar Galactica"
Not my first choice of actor for Willy Wonka great actor but the trailer he comes across as a predictable American with little character
This looks surprisingly good
Bit weird A young Wanka Forced Unnatural Weird Wellnot for me Am sure it will have an audience just not me
this looks so soulless
Kind of wish they let Wes Anderson do this but Im very excited for another Paul king film
Tbh chalamet acting doesnt look the best but if its made by Paul King the guy who made paddington this is for sure a banger
This looks like absolute garbage
They forced once again a black girl to be a supporting actress 
I love that this is taking inspiration from every source The books the movies even a bit of the musical thrown in there
We cant come up with anything original 
"Disney and Hollywood  Evil
Hollywood and Celebritys  lluminatis Puppets
In Hollywood many stars use Adrenochrome
Mel Gibson has spoken directly on the subject
I dont know how to break it to you gently 
Hollywood is institutionalized pedophilia
They are using and abusing kids
They churn through a huge amount of kids every year 
Their spiritual beliefs if you can call them that direct them to harvest the energy of the kids 
They feast on this stuff and they thrive on it
What do I mean This isnt some kind of artistic abstraction 
They harvest the blood of children They eat their flesh 
They believe this gives them life force
If the child was suffering in body and psyche before it died they believe this gives them extra life force
There is a creative and loving force inside most of us that guides us through life 
These people dont have this For them its the opposite
Hollywood is drenched in the blood of innocent children 
For a long time all the references to pedophilia and cannibalism were symbolic or allusive 
But I was personally introduced to the practice in the early 2000s
I can talk about this now because these people the execs theyre dead now
The blood of a sexually abused infant is considered highly enriched and is highly prized"
If were lucky it will be a hit Then same cast can do a better Chocolate Factory than He who must not be named
"Lets be very fair here
I cant here take my damn money"
Keegan Michael key absolutely yes
Oof
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE BEFORE THE BEST PREQUEL OF 1971 
Beautiful trailer I feel like Im in another world entirely
Epic
boring 
Hugh grant as a oompa loompas This film has lost it and i want to get lost with it too
ANOTHER remake OMG come on man quit beating dying horses   get a new Idea 
This gives me Dolittle vibes
OF COURSE HE HAS A BLACK SIDEKICK
I really like the energy this has and I already like Wonkas bond with the girl its cute and seems like a little found family between the two
This is giving Wes Anderson vibes I love it
This is so disrespectful to Roald Dahl it should be a prequel to the books not the film
This looks good but y
Looks terrible I absolutely cant wait
This Snow Piercer Prequel is gonna be wild
Looks great but some dialogues are a bit cringy but overall the movie looks good
I might check out this film still  It retains a bit of its auspiciousness  However I am rather disappointed that it is an origin story to the 1971 adaptation of Roald Dahls classic book  It would have been lovely to see an origin story to the original Mr Wonka
Terrible
LMAOOOOOOO cringey
Damn I dont remember this Dune book
goosebumps
this might as well exist sure
not what i expected in a bad way
"hey warner do you want make  another remake of Willy Wonka after the glorious Johnny Depp movie

Sure but i want one condition

tell me

put in a black

warner its implicit"
""
BERRIES AND CREAM BERRIES AND CREAM IM A LITTLE LAD WHO LOVES BERRIES AND CREEEEAM
WASHING
Hugh Grant playing Lord Farquaad
Is it just be or Timothy not giving me wonka Idk Depp ruined me
" and the producer of Harry Potter

No wonder they dress like that particular fashion"
Getting mixed vibes on one hand it looks good on the other I see no mention of an alternate universe 
Apparently this Wonka likes his chocolate dark
Did someone forget to tell Keegan that this is set in London and not Brooklyn
Timothe is the best choice to play this role
Im happy Timothy gets to play Willy Wonka the movie looks interesting cant wait for it to come out 
"From the Director of Paddington
If my wallet could speak it would for this"
mmmm hard pass
Too woke pass
uhhh
God this looks like trash
This actually looks really good
IS THAT MATTHEW BAYNTON
just wrecked a classic once again
Just name the movie Willy already
Its nice to see a movie filled with whimsy instead of being laden with woke
"00
"
terrible movie
ROWAN ATKINSON ROWAN ATKINSON
Chalamet slowly becoming the next gen Johnny Depp
its has to be good right cause paddington is a cinematic masterpiece
Considering the last remake costs a lot to make I am curious how much this one costs in comparison
where its the faxtory 
Just take my money
"This film has a lot to live up too
Gene Wilder made this character into a Legend
Are we going to see another train wreck  Only time will tell"
MATHEW BAYNTONNNNNNNNN
Another woke diverse load of garbage
Woke wonka and the chocolate faces
Sad looks like a movie made just for kids  The other Willy Wonka movies are very much good no matter what age you are  This isnt what I thought it would be
CANT WAIT
With how fascinating Willy Wonkas backstory was in the movie Im surprised its taken 50 years to make a movie about it Very much looking forward to seeing this
nope
So just by looking at the oompa loompas they are using Gene Wilders Willy Wonka so Im guessing this is a setting before the original Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory
Looks woke
That is a new one coming out Oh my God I watched both of the other ones and I like it so I hope this one is really good all the other ones
oh no
omg i am so excited for this
So basically willy wonka is a chocolate mage
Soooo When did he become insane Cause this guy just seems happy af
But he cant be releasing magic flying chocolates into the world yet It isnt until hes older that he invents the Fizzy Lifting Drink which does that exact same thing And nobody is familiar with it when its shown
Chalamet is so wooden
This timm cham guy picking crappy movies
Sorry I dont believe it I cannot get lost in the story it is too woke black side characters historically they were not in that position single mom neoliberalism and more The only good thing is Hugh Grant It is not hate I know is sci fic but the credibility comes with historical references it is not credible And Black characters are always side characters they are never the main one this is too woke
i lke this umpa lumpa 
Bro Charlie and the chocolate factory changed the whole world
Hope its nothing like Tim Burtons adaptation
Seems like a better version of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but a prequel
i wasnt feeling it the whole time but this cast is stacked af really excited now hopefully we see a cameo from the original Charlie actor
I want to see a sequel to this and I never even seen it yet
We were expecting Johnny Depp to be willy Wonka 
I hope you for this movie comes out they might announce theyll do a Looney Tunes short film But this time for someone else who deserves it
Take me Johnson Im yours
Third times a charm
Hersheys Kisses killed you
This doesnt feel like a real movie Thats not necessarily a good or bad thing just a statement
He spent 7 years traveling the world while looking like hes 17 Ya lost me 
TIMMY
"Gene Wilder had his own flair for this character
Johnny Depp had his own flair for this character

This kid has no flair  Hes justthere
Stealing all of Gene Wilders character bits music and more  What an ABOMINATION

This would have been fine for a kids film but it is NOT worthy to carry the name WONKA"
If youre reading this comment salute to you bro  i hope you win in life
Woah
The fact that its written and directed by Paul King Im really excited for the movie
"Its all fun and games until someone hates the the movie and I dont like that  

PS Warner bros is my number 1 favorite company but I dont like David Zaslav "
Looks good but as good of an actor as Timothee is this feels like a bad casting
Phir Se Wonka 
Every good thing in this world started with a dream So you hold on to yours
Thought this was another remake but kinda interesting seeing the origins
Ooh this looks promising
This prequel to Snowpiercer looks pretty legit
This will be a great holiday movie
OK this looks like a prequel more than a third reboot Since everybody loves the original
Cant wait for Timothy Chevrolet to ruin another thing
The prequel I never knew I needed and never thought I would get emotional watching at the end with Wonkas Mothers HERE WE GO MOMMAchills
Looks positively missable
This looks surprisingly good
Everything about this is already heading in the right direction toward greatness
Cant wait for Wonka to change his name to Wilford and start building a train in the season finale
hm
This movie seems ok i still like the others better than this one
ugh couldnt they get a Brit or teach Timothy an RP accent
This looks really boring
this looks like a good but i dont with the whole writters strike has had effected movies poorely so i dont if we be as great as creed III and across the spider verse
I love a twink Wonka
Nah this looks bad already it couldve been good without the magical stuff
"This is the like button that you can only use before this incredible film will come out 

"
Blackwashing again
Loving the new take
Absolute Cinema
Lovely production BUT Those Are Some BIG Shoes To Fill  Should do well but not spectacular   Anyone reading this DID YOU KNOW THE FIRST WILLY WONKA BOMBED AT THE BOXOFFICE  I think a full on Musical would have been the better way to go
Franco looked more believable as Oz than whatever Chalamet is trying to do here
What a wonderful movie for the holidays Timothee dancing and singing YES
Anyone wonking they willy rn
Willy Wonka Willy Wonka Willy Wonka
"Translate 
"
But he is no Jhonny Depp
Nah this aint it The secret ingredient to Willy Wonka is insanity not whimsy 
Wonder what the girls role is in this movie She feels a bit random
So far Im not that big on Timothee Chalamet as Wonka and think that Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp FAR surpass him from what was shown in this trailer but Im definitely watching this for Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant and Keegan Michael Key
Money grab plain and simple Besides everyone knows there are no nonwhites in Wonka Land 
 why
its kinda giving harry potter vibes and im so here for it
jewish psyop the movie
This looks so incredible  I cant wait
You can really tell the academys rules of films needing atleast 3 token black people includes this film The whole vibe just seemsboring
seems like the girl character is a forced diversity hire when will they learn to not do these sheningans add characters where necessary and make sense though  wonka only works with ullalammpas
Ok Paul Atriedes You had too much of those spice stuff
This looks like a tumblr fan fictions fever dream
oh come on
The kid playing Willy Wonka is super cringe and weird looking
Its already good
Brad Williams implied something about the dwarfism community being upset about Hugh Grant Is that true or was he just joking
What would make this top tier is if theres clue for snowpiecer
Did this film really need to be made Is Hollywood so bankrupt for ideas that they have to capitalize on the 1971 classic again
No one asked for this 
""
This made me smile  I love movies that tap into my childhood
This movie will flop
Delightful
Id watch this
Willy Wonka got kicked out of Hogwarts and is now making chocolates
Like the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory it seems to give me the munchies for chocolate
I was a little on the fence about this at first but now Im intrigued
This looks terrible
Its not really doin it for me Gene Simmons is the one for me
Back in my day you got traumatized by gene wilder in Willie Wonka movies whippersnapper
hmmm idk 
finally
Absolutely not
142 MrBean 
OMG 
Good for Christmas 
Looks a bit cheeks if were being honest
Awalnya gak tertarik nonton tp gua jd mau nonton ini krn ada mrbeannya jd cameo
This really looks awful just awful
oh my is it just me or is wonka looking mighty fine this afternoon
Finally a movie that looks like a  classic without any woke agenda no lgbtq no making wonka the race he isnt etc just good old plain fun Im excited for it
Okay you got me with from the director of Paddington
Looks absolutely terrible Boring actor just another teen heart throb to boost sales gimmick Surprised they aint try to add Zendaya Hugh looks great Will be a hard pass tho
I can see Gene Wilder in him
Hugh Grant sold me I wasnt sold and then Hugh Grant came on and I was sold Dang it
It might be good but in the back of my head I will know that Roald Dahl will be rolling in his grave over this
yall too easy to please
Now this looks like a movie I can sink my teeth into Just like a really good chocolate bar
Monnezza
This is gonna be HUGE
omg
No just NO No no please no dont do it I just feel its a disrespectful act towards the character and everything he ever was
did anyone else catch The Flash DCEU crossover candy
Please no
"Come with me and youll be
In a world of pure imagination"
Another
Very interesting casting for Wonka Ill try to keep an open mind
at first I was like why do we need a prequel and now im like oh nvm yeah we need this
Why is Willy Wonka suddenly Daniel thrasher  Hes a youtuber
Im actually looking forward to this movie Seems fun and sincere not to mention the cast is absolutely stacked Seeing Keegan MichaelKay in the movie also made me damn near jump in my seat
Lol Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity
I mean I like paddington But do we need this
"From the director of Paddington youve sold me
From the producer of Harry Potter and youve lost me"
Meh
and suddenly i miss Jhonny Deep and good cgi
Looks OK Anything to redeem that world from Tim Burtons ridiculous nonsense RIP Gene Wilder
Nope
Chocolate is melanin Blacks have it Whites dont
Make new IP
Only wish we could have seen Gene Wilder in a prequel of Willy Wonka
Dont eat the peaches thats not cream in them
I wonder if there will be a sad ending with Wonka being alone telling all his workers to leave employing the ompaa lompas and shutting down his factory
so weird to see mr moseby in movies
I loved Paddington but I was never a fan of Willy Wonka movies  Also Timothy Chamalet as Willy Wonka Huh
""
Hugh Grant as an umpa lumpa Im there
Not going watch this because Johnny Depp is will always be Willy Wonka in my opinion This not Willy Wonka
The last thing anyone needed If youre going to make abominations of classic films please at least have respect for the material
Why dont all of you pedos take a hint and stop making your garbage and disappear
Looks like WBD is planning on extending their run of flops into December
Another one
It looks like the manager from Key and Peeles frozen yogurt shop skit has a cousin in law enforcement
Omggg I can not waitttt
Im just here for 103 
tim burtons wonka had daddy issues this one has mommy issues lol
Im so in love with this
no no no no no no no no
"I cant help it but compare Johnny Depps willy wonka to this one And the difference is huge for me
I dont what it is but it lacks the magic "
I am probably the only one who cant get w this 
Nothing against the actors but Who asked for this 
OMG
Why
MUADDIB WHAT ARE YOU DOING
This just looks awful
Is there a reason why they mock the story instead of being serious with the story
Oompa Loompas need they own film
idk how to explain it but timothy chalamet is the most willy wonka name
Rowan Atkinson 
Deep Roy will always be my Oompa Loompa
This just looks like a Mary Poppins movie not a Willy Wonka movie
I really hope Oompa Loompa come as a native Tribe like the original
Doesnt feel like theres much of a story here And I love me some 
Great cast Im in
Im sorry hes too young How can I be expected to believe a 16 year old is an expert at anything and an explorer
This feels like a Man Carrying Thing video
Timothee as Willy Wonka  Im SO excited
Huh Its a prequel to the Gene Wilder movie rather than the Burton movie Wonder how they got the Roald Dahl Estate to agree to that given that author hated the Gene Wilder version
This looks sick
Its a origin movie
021 AYO NUTTY 
Seems good
Chalamets Willy Wonka looks and sounds like Sheldon Cooper WB is intent on making no money for the rest of their time as a studio it seems
Please stop remaking old classics Ruining good films for a payday no thanks
Very worried but as soon as I saw Paul King as director Im slightly less worried It might actually be good
I think this looks like a good movie I will for sure be seeing it when it is released 
This movie  is going to make the late Gene Wilder happy
This looks magical and im not even into these types of films
Ok this was something I didnt know I wanted but yeah I want this I hope to God its good it looks amazing and nostalgic  I cant wait for this and during the Christmas season come one Well done
He who controls the cocoa controls the universe
Do we really need another remake
Hear me out Timothee as Jack Skellington and Jenna Ortega as Sally in NBC live action remake
roald dahl will be turning in his grave about all this monetising trash  trying to be associated with his amazing works
Another big 200M movie remakeprequel Cant wait for not watching it
Ayoo timothee got range 
Im glad its inspired by Gene Wilders Wonka but I kinda wish Christopher Lee was around to be his disapproving dentist of a father RIP to both legends
Looks good will definitely see it in theaters
Interesting Idea wrong casting
Many years ago it looked like a nave fantasy Now it looks like a highly detailed bad trip in 3D combined with a fever dream
Yessss
Looks terrible
Wanka 
for the love ofCOME UP WITH ORIGINAL IDEAS
Ill say this some of the jokes in the trailer are quite funny 
Its incredible that its based on a true story
Ghastly
What a sanitized and vanilla depiction
just make an original movie ffs
Why did they remake it Should have left it alone
W movie
Wow nod to the original strike it reverse it 
I hope this is as good as it looks
bruh if that guy is playing Willy Wonka i gotta go see it
Never thought I would prefer the Tim Burton film over anythingbut then I saw this trailer
timothy chocolate
Pure Imagination
Oof
Looks like a quality piece of confection indeed
I see Im the only one that thinks this looks like complete trash
"I got an idea Lets exploit workers for my benefit 
Oh cool Capitalism is wickedddd s"
Seeing Timotei Shampoo Vicky Pollard and Charles the Second in the same trailer is genuinely jarring 
Seeing Sally Hawkins as Wonkas mom feels so wholesome for some reason
I never thought my life would be
I came here with low expectations but it surprisingly looks good and heartwarming
looks ok
man this gets a remake and we cant get a polar express sequel
So is this a prequel to the original Willy wonka
Timothy Chalamet really is a great actor Dune part 2 and Wonka just shows he can do anything
OMFG 
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe
Not gonna lie I rolled my eyes when I saw the title thinking it was gonna be another remake but Ill take an origin story  This is giving Ratatouille vibes mixed with some sort of Christmas vibe movie and Im here for it
It actually looks good
Ready to see this in Theaters
CHOCOLATE FINGER ME
I really miss these types of wholesome movies Hollywood used to make back then so much and I hope the Wonka movie dont disappoint 
Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka to me Nobody did it better He is and was a genius
I hope Timothee Chalamet revives what Gene Wilder started and overshadows what Johnny Depp made a dogs dinner of Hes perfectly cast for this role quirky and talented
I was on the fence until Hugh Grant Im in 
Oh god please stop Hollywood
This looks cute
Woke Wonka has arrived
Only Gene Wilder can play Wonka no one else will do it justice
This looks awful The reverse that line made my skin crawl The over use of CGI has got to go in all movies Go real or go away
So tired of remakes Old version was perfect Where is WBs originality
As long as my favorite Rowan Atkinson is in this movie Im not avoiding it
Ill be damned didnt think that Johnnys version could be topped  This trailer looks better than that entire movie
he lacks his lover the old man because i know he likes older than he is
How is no one talking about Mathew Baynton and Simon Farnaby the Horrible Histories actors being in this
i knew lil mabu was an industry plant
Same dumb remake MAKE SOMETHING NEW
What happened to the creative minds Im sick of remakes or prequels  sequels and blah blah blah Please give us something new 
Pass
Great cast confused by the script Hoping for the best
I believe that Wonka will be perfect film as Carl and chocolate factory
Ill stick to dune part 2 thanks lol that cgi looks on Disney par 
Amazing movie
Timothee acting happy is off putting
rowan atkinson is in it so i will watch it
Mr Bean
Looks like a wholesome movie
Too many black people
I love the visuals The scene of the balloons seems ethereal 
This looks terrible
Is he supposed to be a young Gene Wilder
once again Hugh Grant saves everything hes in
"Tim Burtons Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was HORRIBLE 
Of course the 1971 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory will always be the best but I hope this movie is somewhat decent Honestly there is no need for another"
This looks awful Stop making fake backstories
Cant wait to see this especially when it is releasing just a few days before my birthday Yayyy 
willy wonka origin story ah 2023
WAITso does this mean ALL the oompaloompas are Hugh Grant
i need him
I love the cast of multiple famous British actors 
If you really didnt mumble I probably would understand what youre saying
Timothe Chalamet is a phenomenal actor I hope they show a devastated and torn side of him to keep the audience from thinking this is only a whimsical story
This looks amazing Cant wait
hes a great visual casting but i feel like his voice doesnt have the grandeur I imagined
This looks dare I say magical
Im so glad the Oompa Loompa looks like the ones from the original film Too bad they didnt cast a little person though
The film will hit a pure imagination
Is this Dune Part II
 cant wait to watch this movie
 
This looks like it is going to be a classic
I know garbage when I see it
This is giving me fantastic beasts vibes
A Movie without Jonny Depp ist not a good Movie
 doesnt look good
Swaer to god Timothee Chalemet is the next big thing if he keeps playing his cards right
This looks nice
Michael Kors should be Oompa Loompa tho 
I remember when the she hulk trailer dropped and we said it looked pretty good  Not gonna judge until i see it 
i never thought there will be a willy wonka origin story 
So he DIDNT turn kids into Wonka Bars
Wasnt really looking forward to this but the CAST good lord what a great cast Ill watch it for that alone
i loved Timothe Chalamet in Call Me by Your Name and Beautiful Boy but i really dont know how i feel about him playing Willy Wonka its kinda off putting
usually i hate reboots and remakes but this one actually looks great but of course we cant judge just by a trailer i would have to wait for my trusted reviewer to review this movie whether it is worth it or not
Such bad writing Im so tired of them making a movie people recognize and know theyll come see that they put zero effort into the writing Nithing to see here just people defying gravity Ugh
So my first thought when I sae this was really another wonka movie And thought after the last one it was going be trashtrailer actually looks decent
So theyre just going to white wash the fact that the Oompa Loompas are literally a kidnapped tribe of pygmy slaves from the Deepest and Darkest reaches of Africa
Im so excited for this film I love his previous performances
Well hes no Gene Wilder  Seems pretty dull
They shouldve brought back Johnny Depp But oh well
"i love these type of lore movies always wondered how he became to be

what other character from other movies yall think need lore movies "
I know Im gonna love this movie its Willy wonka
The original Wonka movie will continue to be the best 
Cannot believe this guy is dating Kylie Jenner
This could be really interesting
They had me at wooly 
Ill pass
Christ and people said Solo was an unnecessary prequel
If this is going to be a thing it better be decent at the least
If this is how you get people excited for a film you failed This looks like more modern trash on beloved IPs
Rowan Atkinsons appearance alone is enough to let me know that this movie is gonna be great and of course our boy Timothy will amaze us with his performance
looks exactly like every fantastic beasts movies and like those modern Marry poppins knockoffs
If I aint broken dont fix it 
Im already cringing 022
I always had a crush on willy wonka
I remember those old Batman and Star wars fan trailers from years back Troll fan trailers have really come a long way and become much more elaborate in the recent years Keep it up you troll rascals
Yay I have always loved this movie Cant wait
Leave it alone
Hes gotta be more introverted tho
Do tickets come with a free Willy Wonking Otherwise Imma pass on this
cringe
Had absolutely no interest in this movie as I was watching the trailer until Hugh Grant showed up all adorable and orange 
I think Jeremy Allen White would have been perfect as wonka He has a lot Gene Wilder energy
Why
It was losing me but when I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa in the end you sonnovabisj Im in
i think i deserve this movie
Seriously WHY The cinemas are filled to the brim with remakes sequels and superhero movies New stuff please
This looks surprisingly delightful
"Wokea
Watch it fail"
A LITTLE CRINGEY CHALAME SHOULD HAD WAITED A LITTLE MORE FOR THIS ROLE 
Ye but will Wonka be Woke 
UGH this movie has been done to death Somebody remake chitty chitty bang bang
I dont want to love this but Im not sure Im going to be able to stop myself 
Didnt want to try your luck with Ezra Miller again
This trailer got me more excited this movie than I thought I would be I can see that they are going more for a johnny depp Wonka backstory rather than a gene wilder Wonka backstory which I love My only concern is Im a little afraid the timelines wont match up with this movie and Charlie and the chocolate factory but thats fine
Super woke as usual Theyve included the token spunky black girl side kick I feel sorry for her career when will the Woken end their ingrained racism
Why does this look like a Fantastic Beasts movie trailer Great video tho
Oh this actually looks so good 
I feel likei wanna see this
We need Carmy from The Bear as Wonka
Never forget God loves you and is our lord and savior
I love how they mixed up the original score form the older films that really shows the care put into the film This is so exciting 
Seriously  now we need a black Wonka
Didnt know I needed this in my life
Timmy may have the look but he does not have the voice let alone the charisma for Willy Wonka
Nope
Is that you Daniel thrasher danielthrasher
Well I didnt know I needed another Wonka movie but apparently I do 
Yeeeahhh not buying into this
Fact that rowan Atkinson is in the movie now this is a must watch
Can they please think up new stories to tell I guess not
Googles homer Simpson umpalumpa
cant wait
I was expecting a horror movie but I could deal with this
Seems like an interesting twist on Roald Dahls story PlusHugh Grant Looks promising
Wonka is gonna be a world of Pure Imagination
"HUH I was worried but this actually looks like it could be okay HOPEFULLY it captures the charm of the first one with Mr Wilder but looks like there already implentening charactersics from that way 

Hope its summin wonderul"
This is ridiculous I see straight through the premise
This looks cute glad the Paddington people are making it
And you wouldnt have chocolate without Native Americans who happen to be missing in this entire movie But we arent a large demographic so no need to cater to us the descendants of the creators of Chocolate representation isnt important if it cant warm the seats inside a theater
If kids and teens see this it must be a rule they watch the original then the second one first
This will do great in China
I can see how Timothee Chalamet grows into Johnny Depps version
And here I thought Mario was going to be the only movie worth seeing this year
Now this is a movie I can look forward to Which is more than I can say for many recent and upcoming Disney movies I wonder if well see any of the vicious fauna of Loompaland
Has a Fantastics Beasts feel to it Not sure if thats good or not
okay okay so its not a super serious movie Alright I need to change my expectations a little bit
Why do we need another version of this film Seriously at what point do we story rehashing same old stories over n over n over Im so over it and will not be paying to see this Hopefully writers strike will weed out new diversity  hire horrid writers and give the creative qualified writers pay they deserve Then maybe we can get original interesting films again
y el jony dep 
snow piercer prequel
fart
Id better get at least one new fetish from watching this movie
Not sure bout the casting of timothee seems a lil awkward Everything else is great
the most unnecessary movie ever
This is insufferable
Ill be honest this looks terrible
This looks so much fun to watch its on my list for sure
This looks bonker fun a classic WB brain tickler
Cant Hollywood make something thats not a Marvel movie not a remake or not a sequel
I can see the film ending with him telling someone well here we go right as the door to the factory opens and its the scene where we see him for the first time in the 1971 movie
Cant wait to hear all the conservatives call this woke nonsense
102  i may be tripping but did i just see mrbean in the flesh 
looks pretty amazing 
YOOOOOO THIS IS GONNA B AWESOME
I was worried about another remake but this is actually a breath of fresh air Kudos
It looks really good I think it will stand or fall with Timothe Chalamet  as Willy Wonka Johnny Depp is just really brandmarked into my brain he had that touch of otherworldly And I somewhat feel like a Willy Wonka really needs that since its not just chocolate it literally defies gravity apparently
MATTHEW BAYNTON OH MY GODDDDDD
Aint better than gene wilder
     
""
Paul Atreides will lead another Chocolate Jihad
ITS THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORIES
meh
Im obsessed about Hughmpa Loompa  The Best and funniest
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is nightmare fuel
Well looks like origin stories is the theme of movies this year
Im excited to see this but Im not a big fan seeing a Oompa Loompa cgi
My mother and I are going to love this prequel film
The trailer gives me the classic movie trailer vibes lol
Wanka
"If Disney made this
Wonka will be gender race swapped
And she will explain why she has two fathers"
Why is this needed It looks fun sure but it just feels like another cash grab
This looks incredible Gonna be an absolute Christmas treat
Mr bean
Hollywood is REALLY trying to make this Chalamet kid happen
Sadly this guy doesnt look charismatic enough
 
Must we
Does it seem Timothee trying to do an imitation of Johnny Drop Willy Wonka with none of the charm
These are all genuine comments and not botsshills No sir all real
Hope doesnt have many songs  we love the old classic one
How many times we gonna roll out the same movies give us something new
Oh no 
omg I CANT wait Whooooooooooooooo     Come with me and you will seee pure imagination See you there 
This looks great
I didnt know this was in the works but it looks really good
I already hate it Too woke for me The classic one and the Johnny Depp are the only 2 great versions Plus that actor sucks
Just give chamalet the oscar
Bro who asked for this
This immediately felt like Harry Potter
Omg I cant wait to see this  Timothee Chalamet is a brilliant actor
It was a Factory not a shop
Found the trailer Thought Id totally despise it cant wait to watch it 
I was skeptical when I read the title expecting another boring and soulless reimagining but this looks very promising Looking forward to it
the casting 
Ah cool yeah no thanks
i thought willy wonka is from disney well i hope this is good cause johnny depp willy wonka is really good
""
Wonka without rhythm
This looks great 3 Awesome casting
134 its the guy from horrible histories
Shouldve called it WILLY
I wasnt sure until they showed the HARRY POTTER text in the HARRY POTTER font but because I liked HARRY POTTER I am reassured and will consume this product
This Wonka has too much energy for me He doesnt seem socially awkward enough
"A movie about how one of my favourite characters created by one of my favourite novelists for one of my favourite books of all time came to be Im in
Yessiree bob this looks to me like a product of pure imagination Im sure it will do well at capturing the magicspirittone of the book too"
I was really not on this films side because you know pointless remakespin off but god damn it I am more than a bit intrigued I have to say
Another remake forcefeeding new black characters into the mix This looks absolutely atrocious What happened to actors with talent This is guaranteed to lose money
FFS can we get good fresh stories for once and not endless and unnecessary rehashings of existing IPs
this looks so generic and low energy and Timothy Chalamet comes across so uncharismatic in this trailer
A movie no one asked for A prequel to something that didnt need one On todays sequels prequels and franchise  movies if would be nice to see something original that wasnt hooked to an existing or past property
Why whats the point of this
it looks like its fun not too serious understands that source material
031 MATT BAYNTON AHAHAHHAHA I LOVE HIM
Remember Timothee Chalamet is the young version of Willy Wonka This movie is a prequel to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
why timothee look like lil mabu
I forgot this was happening But it looks so fun
Again
"Fickelgruber is gonna be in this
Hes the one who stole from Wonka"
So badly casted
The original movie was Original
So Warner is making movies like Disney now great cause Disney is too woke now terrible at making real movies
I hate prequels but this looks like itll be a good one
He look like Carol from MrBeast lol
This looks really cute and good
First Gene Wilder forever  That being said I will give this a fair chance as it looks fun   And if we can get a cameo in there for Slugworth that would cinch it for me
"All dreams must mean something
My dreams"
Movie looks fun but Timothee is absolutely NOT selling me that hes Willy Wonka There was always this unhingedslightly insane vibe to Wonka both Wilder and Depps and Timothee is giving off more of a quirky vibe than genuinely off his rocker Everything else looks fun and interesting though
i spotted 3 london locations
Oh johnny depp i mis u more than anything
Why tf are there so many black people Basically guarantees that this movie is bad Give us good story not social engineering
Theyre casting kid in too much Trying to capitalize on whatever his fan base sees Just doesnt fit Super soft
As soon as I saw the paddington director was involved I knew it was gonna be good
The fact that this is based off the Gene Wilder version turns me off of it completely I couldnt stand that movie and neither could Roald Dahl
I dont understand how he can enslave the oompa loompas in todays climate they will probably write around that
Do we really need this
Its great to see Hugh grant in this movie I love seeing oopmpa loompa in this movie
nooooooo
Nahh nothing beats Depp
No no no no no Worst idea ever
Totally cant wait to see this This is what weve all been waiting for an origin story of Roald Dahls Wonka
who did the casting they need a raise
If only it were camp
I really loved Johnny Depps version Im interested to see how this turns out Looks interesting
"You cant outperform Gene Wilder Stop trying to outperform Gene Wilder

Thank you
The World"
Well third times the charm lets see how it does
"Another crappy remake of a classical movie 

Nothing beats the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 

Gene Wilder is the BEST Willy Wonka period"
"Nah
I still prefer the old version of wonka"
I dont know  Im not liking it
Not as good as the orginal one
BOoooooooooo yawn
""
greatest showman vibes
blackwashing needs to stop
Maybe its because Im the same age as Timothee Chalamet but I cant take him seriously in a role that I grew up feeling like is for a grown man
This looks fun
take notes Disney THIS is how you do remakes RIGHT
This is what creative bankruptcy looks like
I feel like they shouldve casted someone older
Wonkas double huh was to use slave labour by smuggling oompa loompas into his sweatshopfactory
The only thing that looks good about this movie is literally one scene and its of course about the Oompa Loompa
Looks absolutely horrible They cast the wrong guy for the role Wonka should be more mysterious creepy at times Why go with CGI Ompa Lompas Disappointed in this garbage
This looks terrible 
This looks absolutely terrible
Oh please not another beloved character thats going to be totally destroyed no one asked for this movie
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe
this looks terrible lmfao
why is the oompa loompa basically stewie griffin 
Willy WOkeA
Hugh as Oompa is good but Chalamet as Wonka is so boring
If I dont see a young version of Charlies grandpa I will be so dissapointed
Oompa loompa doompety doo
"Well a uplifting and festive movie to have fun and be entertained with your family with no woke bs or identity politics in it Not from Disney I see
Count me in"
this actuallly looks really cute and good
I dont know why but no
his voice doesnt fit this at all or his style  i think they could have cast better with hugh jackman or Jeremy Allen White maybe even Hugh Laurie  or Benedict Cumberbatch
Need Jonny depp 
Chalamet has Dune part 2 and Wonka releasing in November and December Hes on a roll
My favourite part of the trailer is when Rowan Atkinson screams Run Away In his mr bean voice or the fact that Key from Key  Peele is in it
Why do they keep redoing this movie let it rest and come up with something new
Willy Wonka loves chocolate  Hes into black chicks
timothys line delivery sounds so bad sounds forced with zero personality with Gene Wilder it felt authentic
Man Timothe Chalamet seems like the best actor for the next generation of movies This man is quite talented
This feels like an SNL skit
Is it just me or does Timothies performance in this seem a bit uninspired Cant judge just from a trailer though
I never realized how much Timothy looks like Daniel Thrasher
Thats a really good Daniel Thrasher impression Timothee is doing
Wow imagine trying to sell me a Willy Wonka origin story The original story is about charlie Maybe these idiots dont get that wonka was only interesting because he was closed off to the public Now the guy is some super positive guy making magic candy Roald dahl deserves better
I dont know how I feel about Timothy Im getting modern acting and its taking me out of the time period of the movie gene wilder had a sense of wonder  whimsy and wackiness to him that Timothy seems to be lacking
Oh another willy wonka remake
Love him in the king and dune this gonna be another iconic depiction of wonka
Ok you know what This is hype Im really looking forward to this
Woke Willy  never mind you can have him
Looks like its gonna be woke trash And the Oompa Loompas are too damn small
It looks amazing Looking forward for it
ARRGGHH THE OOMPA LOOMPAS 
So the color purple and Wonka this is gonna be a great holiday season
I am sooo excited for this I feel like we havent had a fun festive magical feeling movie in years Cant wait to see what Chalamet brings to the table as Wonka
Welcome to the Wizarding World of Willy Wonka
Is that Alan Johnson from peep show 
"meh

On and off it caught my attention But

meh I really hope its not connected to Depp or Wilder and is its own thing because otherwise it doesnt make any sense"
Gotta go see it just for Hugh Loompa
Hugh Grant lol
Meh
Ok not connected with trailer  but want to see movie then we decide its good or not let see
I hate that boy
Yikes Hard pass
Wow simply awful
Its Finally Here The Wonka Remake
Looks like a Milk Dud
I am really excited to see this movie 
Timothee Chalamet has that lead actor voice like Chris Pines
Why dont they use freddie highmore 
Kid playing wonka is trying WAY too hard
""
""
Damn i was hoping for johnny depp to be wonka again
this will flop epically
Oh Wow I assumed Timothe Chalamet was a better actor than what I just saw Sheesh stick to solemn drama son
big let down did not like it
Fully onboard for this
I would love to see Ezra Miller play Wonka
Willy Wonka is a sociopath will Wonka embrace this characterization
Is this a video
Uh oh
I swear Johnson just flashed up on my screen
The very idea of this movie seemed like an awful idea to me until I saw that the Director of Paddington is directing this Now I am 100 on board
why am I crying
Film looks badand talk about cultural appropriation hiring white male actor hugh grant and doing orange face when there are real oompa loompas looking for work and being overlooked because of whitey yet againI always see short fat orange women when I go out on a night out
"This Movie is 

Adventurous

Musical

Comedy

Drama



100 CHOCOLATE"
Im not sure about this one but Im going to watch it because I always wanted that Golden Ticket
I am happy this is an origin and not just a remake of the original film and book
A prequel of the book and movie Charlie and the chocolate factory not Tim Burton Willy Wonka this is I gotta see
Oof hard pass The guy playing wonka has talent but you are never going to beat the original
Mmm  Willy Woke  i pass
Load of shite
Gotta love revisionism
OMG brilliant  The only way they could have done it a prequel so not to compete directly with Gene Wilder  We need more movies like this
They should of hired Little person this is total disrespect Why did they hire Hugh grant  Cancel this movie
Cant wait to Swamp My Wonka to this
They had me at Director of Paddington
Once we start dancing we cant stop is what sold me ahahahahaha
Interesting how the trailer on youtube has a lot positive reviews yet other outlets have more negative ones
Love the how they use pure imagination in this the inspiration is lovely
Woke movie    Let see the original movie     new movie   a woke 100 
Really driving whatever they can into the ground
I like this a lot already didnt think another sequel could look so good
WHAT
Be crazy if Johnny depp cameos in this movie
Another film about this Prolly woke out the wazoo Wonka
Is that chalamet
Timothe Chamalamadingdongdo is a big no for me
This Doesnt work
Not really feeling the setting
Where is Johnny Depp  cc
When this comes online Ill watch it Looks so cute
Wasnt Charlies dad a dentist From the original movie
This is my joker
How long before Paddington 3 
Wow this looks terribleanother cash grab to ruin another childhood movieSo many movies destroyed by wokewood lately
Bro isnt even acting hes just raising his voice lmao this looks awful
I dont like forced black characters
Timothee Chalamet is literally so attractive Im going to melt
I was excited when I first heard about this film but now Im not certain part of the fun of the original story was that Wonkas factory was a magical part of a mundane world but everything here looks fantastical Ill still see it and give it a chance
I like how Chalamet seems to be borrowing from Gene Wilders classic performance as Willy Wonka
Kylie thing was def PR
They thought they could surpass Tim Burton and Johnny Depp
From what Ive seen Johnny Depp can sleep well
Is Mr Bean the priest
I was almost unhappy till i saw it was Timothee and now im super excited He embodies Willy Wonka so well
GARBAGE NWO PROPOANDAOHHHHHH WOW IS THERRE A TOKEN BLACK GIRL NOW
This looksehh
Here we gooo
Laaaame The whole point of wonka was his mystery
The trailer could have been reduced to the last bit with Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and it would have been enough for me to book a ticket 6 months in advance
Im so exciteddddjddkjdksdk
I couldnt help but think of Daniel Thrasher when I saw this
This looks colorful and just fun It looks great to me
Thank god they didnt make him black
"Ompa lompa dopadedo how many bumps of K can you doNO
Thats a No Bueno for me Sorry Timmy I will however be seeing DUNE Part 2"
This looks like a really fun sweet and adventurous movie with hints of innocence This movie looks great Mom and I are all in We cant wait until December
They need to explain wonka making the tunnel
Nice
Looks great but wouldve been better if Tim Burton directed
A double huh
"Finally
Been waiting for so long for this"
this looks good
Cant wait to see However this trend of adding a presumably bland totally unnecessary and uninteresting black female character to a white male MC is both hilarious and annoying So she will either be a wellwritten character which is as rare as a good villain or a total waste of screen time which couldve been given to Timothee Chalamet
"PURE TRASH

Help we have no more creativity so we must recycle old stuff in an extremely soulless way  Hollywood"
How dare they take such liberties with Dahls work If they wanted another movie why not just make Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator
Well at least he doesnt look like Michael Jackson this time
The origins of Hershey 
This looks like a really fun and interesting movie I havent seen Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory since I was a kid bringing this back now is filling my heart with joy and I hope the younger generation gets the same experience and enjoyment I did watching the original
"24 horas en un coche
nadie ms puede arruinar mi noche
solo tu
solo tu"
Timothee Chalamet really nailed it as a young Willy Wonka
Not interested unless they have the original oompa loompas before the book was censored
""
Wonka Origins
You had me at writerdirector of Paddington
This might be really good
This movie looks WAY better than it had any right to be Timothee Chalamet already LOOKED the part of Wonka but after seeing this trailer he genuinely FEELS like the character Also Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is unexpectedly amazing lmao
I already see myself in the cinema watching this movie with a huge bag of popcorn and A LOT of chocolates
Eh idk I didnt feel like it was anything special from this trailer Seems somewhat boring
Gene Wilder would be proud
This looks gorgeous I cant wait to see this movie this December this is just a awesome trailer
HARD PASS
Terrible casting Chalamet has no sense of how to have a wacky type of charisma that Wonka is supposed to have Just some regular likable teenage guy
"YES 
YESSSSSSSS
ROALD DAHLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLLL"
Not this guy again
I dont mean any disrespect towards Timothe I consider him becoming a fabulous actor movie after movie but their cant be anyone playing the character of Wily Wonka better than the Johnny Depp himself Hes is remarkable when it comes to play characters in fantasy movies
Ineed to see more not sold on timothee as Wonka
How many times does the movie need a make over they are really milking it
Thats literally just Timothee Chalamet dressed as Wonka He hasnt sold me I dont believe hes Willy Wonka Ill still see it but prolly not in theatres
Johnny Depp was the bestThis one Meh I dont get how this Timothy even became an actor
Another remakeWooHoo To not so bodily go where weve been multiple times before Pass
Boring the bottom has been ripped out of this many a time
lost me at the choreographed dancing day dream
I Love Wonka Best Movie Favorite
This actually looks pretty good  I think Ill be dragging my disabled backside to the theater for this one
Eh why is this happening
Im so excited to see this  They filmed a part of this in Lyme Regis and I could see the set from the town
Wow
So this is like a prequel
Made me smile hope the movie is a good time at the theatres
I always love an underdog kind of story where the person beats the living daylights at the giants corporations and wins against the odds So Im looking forward to it Probably will come out near xmas
Everything looked great until Hugh Grant became an Oompa Loopa That is super cringe and the face tracking was off
"I started dancing now 
Once weve started we cant stop
You can hear in his tone that its involuntary"
      
Great Im a simp again
Was that Mr Mosby 107
that sure is a lot of brown people for a victorian era movie
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm disappointing but u never know what it really says about the film surprisingly unsure about timmy
I think this movie is gonna be a musical origin and the power of imagination into one perfect masterpiece If of the song is gonna be the wonderful of imagination and that would be nice to add in this movie
Rowan Atkinson 
Oh great Another Wonka remake
I didnt know I needed to see Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa was something I needed to see
Bruh this movie sucks already Willy wonka aint magical
"Oompah loompah doopity dop
This looks like it could very well flop"
My husband messaged me Im not sure this looks like its any good but it stars ya boy Chamalamadingdong which means you know Im going to go see it 
They like beating dead horses dont they
Timmy where is the call me by your name 2 
Ohkay I want whatever the directorwriterproducers are on Looks fun
Ive come up with this amazing idea of what the ending of Wonka could be Almost like a bonus scene kind of thing when the film has finished but just before the credits I imagine the film builds up Wonkas story from his childhood to him getting his own shop and then factory etc What if the ending scene was him as an older man opening up the doors to the chocolate room With Charlie Veruca Violet Augustus and Mike all by his side They walk in and he sings Pure Imagination
"Is it just me or Thimothe Chalamets expressions here are really similar to Daniel Thrashers


Actually now that I think about they look kinda similar"
"For me Johnny Depp is the only Willy Wonk 
NO ONE CAN REPLACE

No hate to Timothe"
AMAZING PRODUCTION  I cant wait to see it  Timothe Chalamet so young and soo amazing actor 
The last time I checked Willy Wonka didnt have a blck girlfriend But whatever Welcome to the woke generation
Did they ever make a Great Glass Elevator movie When are we going to see Wonka fight some aliens
I cant wait to discover how Willy became Wonka
This looks horrible
Wow a movie for kids that doesnt have some political BS messagefrom what I can perceive How refreshing
Timothee Chalamet is the TikTok influencer version of Willy Wonka He is the bland and depressing artificial chocolate while Gene Wilder is the rich and tasteful real chocolate
I feel like this would be a cute movie but the natural charm of Willy Wonka isnt there with the main character At least for me
I really hope weight gain is a major plot point
Absolutely soulless
""
This looks like fun but Im getting Greatest Showman vibes Im in
What a bunch of bollocks They made a soy boy out of Wonka How then he is supposed to make quality chocolate
Clearly a musical but they seem to be somewhat hiding that fact
debo decir que esta pelcula es pura NOSTALGIA a que si yo la he visto un montn desde chico alguien
This should be better than Johnny Depp but not as good Gene Wilder
I havent seen the Gene Wilder version and dont intend to Even if I had I would still give this one a chance Whats the problem Why all the hate OK you have a sweet childhood memory connected to the original So That doesnt give you the right  to bash something new that comes along Love the original all you want and leave a new generation to maybe fall in love with this version The world is still spinning and time hasnt stopped New music movies and art are created every day Its  your loss if your eyes and ears are closed off for it
Wonkas competitors trying to murder him by literally drowning him in chocolate seems like something that should be jarring and too dark but thats basically how he runs his factory too
This is why movies failing miserly doing the same bs over and over and overpeople are bored bring new stuff ffswill fail miserably for sure
This is what happens when you take too much spice until you get to a point you get blue eyes and thats how you become a Chocolate Factory God
W FILM
Wait what I didnt know Rowan Atkinson was gonna be in this movie Im impressed
Gene Wilder would be very proud
You lost me with casting Hugh Grant in this movie
I dont want to like this Stop making me like this
Omg  Stop recreating movies The talent isnt there anymore
Something you can actually enjoy watching
Looks like an incredible film Shame about the voices though tbh considering its a British classic was Wonka a seppo in the books Or is the accent there to highlight how foreign he is
wowee this looks terrible
""
Timmy appears to be wildly miscast
This looks god awful
"Oh my God an actual genuine lighthearted movie with whimsy and wonder 

Yes please "
"This has piqued my interest  Ill put this in the list along with Napolean

Also here me out in this one Willy Wonka is an ancestor of House Atreides"
I wonder if they will tie Wonka into the Harry Potter Universe
You know Im something of a magician scientist chocolate maker myself
Well that looks stupid af
Sometimes dreams really do come to life  
For FK sake can Hollywood come up with something remotely original and entertaining
good to see Hollywood making an original movie Wonka 342
Why is The Sound of Freedom movie being censored
I dont think itll live up to the previous two howeverrrr it does look enjoyable and somewhat festive which weve been lacking on for a while Its a definite watch
"And once againHollywood has ZERO left in the tank

RIP Gene Wilder The only true WW"
who up wonking they willy
According to Chris Snellgroves article for Giant Freakin Robot this is the dumbest video I will watch today And Mr Snellgrove is the dumbest person I will hear from today This was an amazing trailer cant wait until Christmas
I normally roll my eyes and run from these remakes bit this seems like they actually cared about the source material You can see bits and pieces of it throughout Im tentatively excited
Wtf This isnt how Id imagine wonka at all He looks too young
That psycho still get gigs
""
Where Switzerland
Awful
Good Morning Starshine The Earth Says Hello
A feelgood movie with solid production and memorable characters feel like we havent had one of these in a little while The fact the trailer is already making me smile gives me hopes itll be a nice festive movie for Christmas
soo excited for another light hearted campy movie glad they seem to be making a resurgence
This is one of the worst trailers Ive seen since CATS
Oh wow I cant wait to see this movie about the famous guy who wears a big hat and kills lots of people What What do you mean this isnt the Napoleon trailer
OMG  really this is mostly exciting in decade cant Believe who I love two Willy Wonka movies I love movie that involves Candy and lot lot of Chocolate   kids love chocolate and sweets 
Willy Woka and the Communist Party
I did not expect to be interested but wow  It looks great and what a cast  Am I the only Paterson Joseph fan  Havent seen him in a while  Hugh Laurie Rowan Atkinson John Carter from Downton Abbey Olivia Coleman the best Timothy Chalamet Sally Hawkins  Incredible  I havent watched the original but this looks more up my alley  beautifully filmed with a vintage feel to it
Ok this is awesome Im watching
Actual effort 
there was no need for a random black child there
Please God no
Ok this looks splendid but I NEED a young Grandpa Joe cameo or something for it to be perfect
Woke trash
Hope this bombs hard
Looks like good fun
Just QUIT You pathetic bastards
Well that proves it They are actively making Tim into a new Jhonny Depp
Oh wow I feel like a child again just watching this
TIMOTHE CHAOMLETTWEE
He lacks the silliness that Wilder and Depp brought to us However Ive been unsure of some castings that turned out to be pitchperfect casting So I guess well see
This looks so good Man I just wanna enjoy movies againsave the day Wonka Lol
This is what the world needs Actual talent and care put into it
Now we finally got an origin story of Willy Wonka
Gene wilder was the greatest and they are spitting on his grave doing this Come up with an original movie even though that doesnt happen anymore Please burn this movie
This actually looks good
Oh oh no oh God no
Again
Nope
""
Probably an unpopular opinion but I really dont think Chalamet is right for the part
This looks right
Mr Mosby is that you
Why are you so all excited about another remake of a movie thats already had a remake There is no creativity anymore just remakes thats all they do and its sad Where are the original stories Where are the original heroes
I came here skeptical but I am leaving excited
This feels not quite right Wonka doesnt seem eccentric  enough I feel like they are playing it safe Cant say Im excited for this one
Hugh Grant hitting the same notes Gene Wilders Willy Wonka did hit me hard love the homage to the classic
Is there not 2 Charlie and the chocolate factory movies already
I still cant believe this is real 
ugggggg
Goosebumps
"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator was right there and you decide to do an original prequel 
WHY"
031 MATT BAYNTON
HuhI was skeptical but I really like the tone of this Colour me curious
They spilled some Oz the Great and Powerful in my Wonka prequel
""
the wonka rapture is approaching next episode of wonka watch will be a treat
"Loved the original with Gene Wilder as a kid  Have seen it countless times  I HATED Johnny Depps portrayal of Willy Wonka  This new story is a different story line and it looks interesting  
Im looking forward to it"
Chocolate cartel is crazy
I dont think Im ready for a tiny little Hugh Grant as umpa lumpa
Hollywood is milked dry it seems of any creative original ideas We need an entertainment Renaissance  Reimagined  movies piggybacking off the success of its predecessors
By George I think hes got it 
Oh mr Bean speaks
They really adding Diversity to everything now huh its too much to ask for an accurate period piece and of course the main ingredient add interracial relationship
So this will be a precuel to the Charlie and the chocolate factory movie Interesting
This looks TERRIBLE
Wonder if theyre going to show how he loses his mind and sets up an elaborate scheme to murder four children for gluttony watching too much tv being a spoiled brat and chewing gum
Chamalette seems nailed the young Willy Wonka Or perhaps better than Johnny Depp version
Isnt this the same dude who despises doing any super hero role because hes above it and doesnt wanna be widely known as a superhero So you mean to tell me you did WONKA INSTEAD Lmfao In what way is wonka not gonna follow your career long term
The deaging on Johnny Depp is phenomenal 
Why did they make Willy Wonka hot
Excelent
I hope the Haunted Chocolatier is released around the same time
Can we go maybe 10 years without remake of a remake probably of a remake the original is still always going to be the best
Where is johnny depp What is this x
No
Isnt this the guy from MrBeast
Okay but why
Might as well made Willy blk too  
Omg a prequel to Gene Wilders Willy Wonka I love that theyve preserved the definitely in Europe yet somehow still American setting
This trailer is better than the Depp remake 
He is a terrible choice for Wonka
So were getting a remake of a remake of a remake Got it Another flop coming up
Im actually excited for this movie
They got one of the most stifled actors who mainly just stands around stoutly without emoting much to be one of the most whimsical characters Horrible casting choice fr Then there is the fact that this is just a lazy film making a prequel to a successful classic film instead of something new
Ruining another classic Worthless untalented corporate morons
Its not Willy Wonka without Johnny Depp
A cookie cut chocolate treat by the looks of it
Another Wonka movie 
Love the atmosphere hope it will enterain me like the last one with Johhny
Why was the soda that made you float so secret if he did it 20 years earlier with just candy This is typical zoomer writing
Love how you can her Pure Imagination playing in the back
They should have included a cameo from Johnny Depp
I think it looks spectacular Its one of those stories that you never thought about but know youll love because of all of the childhood memories 
Looks great   
who up wonking they willy rn
Who asked for this
Director of Paddington it has to be good
i was excited for this but imo Timothe Chalamet does not fit the role Its seems the script is more around him as an actor rather then Willy Wonka He makes it feel like another take on Peter Pan versus a Willy Wonka story idk just my vibes
Timonthee has so much skill
Trailer was mid until the oompa loompa then it became legendary
looks good good way to end out the year 
WHAT TIMMY IS WONKA
Why do modern movies always have this dumbass cliche one word title
Original movie is better
I got so hyped until this December 
What a shame this exists
AAA CANT WAIT TO WATCH THIS CUTIE PATOOTIE OF A MOVIE 333
What a shame that this classic has also been destroyed by woke diversity That black woman side chick doesnt even seem to belong Hollywood again saidyeah just toss a black person into meet out quota This may have been good but I will have stop supporting Warner and possible Timothy also
Im not gonna lie I think I love this 
Timothee chalamet is so mediocre
The Willy Wonka prequel we needed but did not realize we needed
Willy Wanka more like
Blackwashed Willie Wokeass
sorry to tell but i think why movies are failing nowadays coz the CGI magic is gone everything feels fake on screen
I have to say that this is the first time a trailer gave me goosebumps I have a good feeling about this one the fact that it is from the director of Paddington Wonkas lead actor has a spirituality of Gene Wilder take of the iconic role and that is great
Lovely will be watching
the endless remakes continue OO
bit like harry potter
This will definitely be a flop Why must every movie nowadays have this type of casting quit ruining good old movies and make your own movies with that BS
After seeing his Chocolate  had effects i cant not see him as a drug dealer inventing edibles for the first time and big Chocolate ant having it
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa might be the best thing Ive ever seen
Yeah that Tim Burton joint was fire tho
Stupid casting
Feels like the same movie as every other one coming out nowadays yawn
This will be the perfect Christmas film 
i was definetly not interested in this until the cgi monsotity at the end i was thinking during the whole trailer where are the damn umpa loompas
Love love love love it 
Keeping blacks employed right Disney
Nope There was one Willy Wonka and one Johnny Depp Sorry Disney but nope
I cant lie I dont rlly know why we need a third version of this story fourth if you count the Broadway musical but its Timmy so Im here for it
""
They should have made him pale
Wow Hollywood is so creative Another remake of a remake
Wowthis actually looks quite magnificent if I do say so myself
J adore  voir 
Cool I dont care But keep up burning money
Once we started we cant stop 
this looks absolutely terrible
"Oh Willy Wonka how you get so tasty 
Mom made a boy should have made a pastry"
Now this is something I needed
The overall movie looks good but the acting feels a bit off The Ooma Loompa bit at the end was hilarious tho so Im probably still going to see it 
Willy WOKE
Uh yes please This looks delicious Pun intended
Went in with low hopes Looks great
103 Looks like Rowan Atkinson lol
Hard NO
Rowan  Atkinson in wonka What more could we ask for
im a simple man i saw Forced Black People i put this on the mustnot watch list
God help us all
So is this a pequal to the book the original film the reboot film or its own universe
Wow The prequel movie no has ever asked for
I hope they explain where the black people came from 
Something about Hugh Grant as an Oompalumpa just made me laugh
If only it was directed by the director of Paddington 2
Pleasecan we just get an original idea please
Willie Wokeah
The Paddington production team and Chalamet sounds like a recipe for success right here especially for the latter as Dune Part 2 is also guaranteed to be a success
It doesnt really look too bad I cant see why its getting so much hate as it is
Willi Wonka was my favourite movie
Yeah and if I didnt spell Hyundai right then its bc its not it  just the mall
If you want to see a good movie watch the sound of freedon
WHY IS THIS HAPPENING
Looks awful
AHHH TIMOTHEE
Wonka is the only thing that didnt convince me aka timothe the rest of the cast is amazingly
This seems like it would be a great movie My only irk is the accents of the main characters Other than that it looks like it would be interesting to watch
My first thought why is he American
whoa that diversity ive never seen so many black people at oncew
 This a prequel of the og cuz of this og song
I love it
This is what Paul Atreides sees when he goes into sugar shock
Pure propaganda  
"Lots of bots stating good things to me this is just another racial propaganda movie just like 

She hulk

Bat woman

Egypt wanna be documentary"
I hope this is good enough to bring back the discontinued Wonkatolife candies I miss my gobstoppers
This wonka Is timothee chalamer when he grow up he Will be the Willy Wonka of Jonnhy deep  
Nahmakes no sense to have the main character have an American accent and everyone else have an English accent He sounds very out of place in this movie
I AM SO READY FOR THIS
"Paul Atreides having a nightmare due to spice overdose

But jokes aside this is one good prequel to a great movie that we will get A pity that it is released only nowwhen it could have been released 10 or even 20 years ago"
Yeah I figured this was gonna look pretty awful Did not disappoint
Soo many great actors That is rarity
Looks boring Dissapointing And really Whats wrong with your casting director Previous Wonka movies were so much better We dont need this bs
Love It 
tbh im not that impressed I wouldve loved to see jim carrey play willie wonka
Gosh this looks really bad
Finally a trailer in 4K yes
Not a good role for Timmy  Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa lollllll
I waaaaaaaaaannnnttttt
Really Were flogging this dead horse again
I hated Johnny Depps Wonka
The same oompa loompa design in willy wonka and the chocolate factory
Come up with something new already Reasons HollyWeird is 
Seeing Rowan atkinson running away in a priest outfit and Hugh Grant as a oempa loempa Ive seen it all 
TRASH INLIKE OLD ONE BYE
Meh
How many times are they going to remake this movie You cant beat the original with Gene Wilder
Awesome something that has been done already A reimagining of a reimagining
I see a splash of Gene Wilder vibes Im in
Ahhh this seems like a good wholesome festive movie  something I think we need more of
Hard pass
Im underwhelmed by the acting in this trailer
But why Just leave stuff alone
They made the Oompa Loompas too small 
I hate remakes but this isnt a remake i dont think  It looks good  I hope its fresh like when you walk into a new room and turn your head to look at every nook and cranny
here we go again
This has got to be one of the best years of Cinema comeback
I dont think Timothee can pull off playing a whimsical dude It seems very out of place
WONKA
Nope
I cannot wait to see this it looks amazing and refreshing 
The chocolatier has awakened
21k btw
Its for kids and teens and family the movie looks for since its aimed for that not 33 year olds but it will smash with tim at the lead smart choice
""
this looks bad the acting is so bad too
Ok the movie is sold to me BUT hugh grant as oompa Loompa take all my money now
That feeling when Paul Atreides snorts the wrong spice
I think this is exactly what we need in modern movies This looks great
NICE At first I was like Nnnoooo not ANOTHER remake and then I was like Oknow why arent there any Oompa Loompas Well played WBwell playedcant wait
Lessggooo man
Am i the only one not sold on Chamalamas acting in this role Hes trying too hard to be quirky but it isnt really in him
Wont be good as the original I can already see lol
"Timmy looks so wonderful as Willy 
Cant wait to see the all magic and beauty in this movie "
Im just wondering was this movie really necessary
WB WTF are u trying to loose money like Disney What and why Who would green light this Trying to out loose the flash Indiana Jones already did that
Its amazing how Timothee Chalamet can play the cold detached leader of a domineering authoritarian empire and Paul Atreides
aHH A Good Christmas movie this year already
Funny how Hollywood tries to erase blacks oppression and treat them equal in movies The lil girl perfect but the cops workers etc Cmon man
Naw
I will only watch if they acknowledge the connection between Willy Wonka and Wilford from Snowpiercer
Cancellation of Blue Beetle Who hurts with iron iron will be hurt CANCELLATION BLUE BEETLE
Why is boyfriend timmy speaking in an American accent
This looks pretty good cant wait to see it 
dont look very good compared with the one with johnny deep 
OMG I WILL BE THERE NO MATTER WHAT Ive waited so long for a new Wonka movie it looks incredible The oompa loompa flute call is heaven to my ears 
Like they said in the trailer hes good too good of an actor
"Please let this be Willy WONKa and not Willy WOKEa

EDIT 7 months later It is Willy WOKEa    who knew"
Once weve started we cant stop 
I know I did not just see Rowan Atkinson 
Bruh No one can beat Gene Wilder
""
This is a whole lot better than what they tried to do with the reboot
bro this gave me super goosebumps I wanna make film like this and tell my stories like that
ITS GONNA BE A MUSICAL IM SO EXITED
Damn this movie looks good
SHUT UP AND TAKE ALL MY MONEY
As soon as I saw From the Director of Paddington I knew this was going to be good
No original ideas left at the mouse house
willy wanka
This looks great
Im sorry but this honestly looks so stupid The original is obviously the best The Depp remake was good but he took the character a lil too dark in that movie But this looks absolutely horrible and is ruining the name of wonka
This is going to be incredible
Is it just me or is the supporting cast pulling this film up I have nothing against Chalamet but this trailer aint selling his acting imho
Ohhhhhh myyyyyy gawwwwddddd cant wait
He is trying so hard to be Depp its cringe
Meh
Time while show but Charlie is girl who likes dark chocolate
Jewish nepotism strikes again
Spending the last two weeks watching the Dune Part Two trailer and now suddenly seeing this this just messes with my head but in a good way
 
Couldnt have picked a more annoying actor to play wonka
"Eh who needs a Wonka prequel film

From the director of Paddington

So when can I preorder my tickets"
So quiet up and listen down Nope Scratch that reverse it hahaha
This really does look pretty good
Sam nie wiem co jest sodsze czekolada czy Timmy
I got goosebumps and a wee bit emotional from this version of Pure Imagination 
This actually looks good
Hugh Grant Is there a shortage of dwarf actors in Hollywood
Timothy is too handsome to be Willy Wonka
I think I have CGI fatigue this looks so boring imho
This looks like a mess  Why does anyone want to know Wonkas origin story  His mysteriousness is what made him intriguing  Timothe Chalamet is an excellent actor but we all know he wont hold a candle to Gene Wilder  Im just tired of these terrible panic money grab movies from Hollywood  Get some original ideas please
Did I hear this right bc I swear I just heard  The Chocolate Cartel  This movie is going to be lame
This looks terrible
Im glad this isnt a reboot more of a prequel to the factory
hmmm

Mathew Baynton Count me in idiots
"God I hope this turns out to be a good movie 

Unfortunately it looks like they ruined the oompa loompas again"
please oh please let this just be a good movie without any crapifying wokeness
When Willy Wonka said Life is like a box of chocolates Ah wait this isnt Disney
Everyone loves a good serial killer origin story
Another money grab that youll all go see and continue to make sure all these AList celebs continue to live lives far beyond yours while you toil away at McDonalds waiting for your very own Wonka moment
Finaly something worth watching
is this based on real events
We havent had this type of movies in yearssss the festive vibes yup will be watching
This should be good
timothee
Is there gonna be an OompaVille cameo
Just why who asked for this movie
Oh no
am i the only one that saw mr bean like the dude just doing  side quest
Honestly looks like a good movie but i kinda wish movie companys stopped refurbishing old classics and bringing them back we need new material
coming to be a huge DUD
No thanks
I hope they sell actual Wonka Bars in honor of this masterpiece
Been alot of let downs lets hope this doesnt ruin something I grew up watching
They will learn when they loose millions 
Oppenheimer Barbie dune and now THIS cinema gods are blessing me 
IS THAT MATT BAYNTON
130 141 IS THAT KEEGANMICHAEL KEY AND ROWAN ATKINSON I have to watch this movie
Owwwww I love it
im already crying and its just the trailer
One moment its taking itself wayyy to seriously about a dude making magical candies and the next its about a dude making magical candies and hilariously being taken as seriously as it should be
Can we stop with these ridiculous remakes
At least the lead actor isnt played by Steve Harvey
Rowan Atkinson 
This looks so much better than I thought itd be
YAWN another WOKE sham Ill stick to Gene Wilder The ORIGINAL and the BEST
this is THE christmas movie weve all been needing
"its similar to The sound of magic Korean drama  but here they used chocolate which refers to magic in drama 
But still it might be interesting"
Why is Key in everything nowadays it seems lol
"It does look interesting Ill say that

If I have one critique it would be it sounds like Wonka is acting not being  But this feels more like an homage to Gene Wilder and I am all for that "
The Trailer alone is still better than the tim Burton one
I honestly dont think he was the perfect choice for Willy Movie still looks great tho But its just Willy Wonka himself that doesnt seem anything like him at all besides the outfit it feels like a whole different character
Theres a black actor literally every scene just to please the wokies lol
This looks terrible Why do you keep making garbage remakes Gene Wilders wonka is the only good one and these imitations are a shame
Bean
This gonna be my favourite Christmas movie
Good to see the horrible history cast lol
Please stop making movies
It looks great
Good thing they included all the minority actors in characters were they dont belong bc I was starting to get antsy without the requisite woke and forced diversity content to keep me from being raycessed
WHATTTTT
"Why Oompa Loompas Master Wonka

Oompa Loompas frighten me its time my enemies shared my dread"
Thank you for not making this a musical throughout Looks good and cant wait to see it
Im so glad Keegan is this movie otherwise I wouldve went mad because why else would he be in this
So thats happening when you get an overdose of spice
Ok This feels  like the beginning  of willy wonka and the chocolate factory 71  Lets see how this plays out
Why do people want to see this Like no one asked for this
Damn Hugh Grant will do literally anything these days
This Trailer makes me want to shoot myself in the face Why didnt he horrifically murder any spoiled rotten brats with his candy
I dont remember Dune Messiah being like this
Is nothing sacred in Hollywood
Chocolate Did you say chocolate
A NEW WILLY WONKA MOVIE
Wanka
whatis this Sheniqua in the coco factory 
cant wait
Timothe definitely slightly channelled Gene Wilders version and Im here for it but what seems like theres a plot hole with Dr Wonka from Deeps version and the bracesno candy storyline
The rags to riches willy wonka story Ofc hollwood had to do this one The benevolent capitalist
Paul MuadDib Wonka  The chocolate must flow   Somehow that works
I dont want to like this But I think Im gonna
From the Harry potter producers Yeah im NOT watching
Cant wait
What a stellar cast
You had me at Timothe Chalamet
Bunch of weirdos in this comment section This movie looks just as bad as every other bad over produced movie weve had in the last 10 years What happened to our standards So sad 
Great so we have to go and interfere with the perfection of a classic  yall are like mr crabs digging up a grave
I neeeed tooooo seeeeee thiiiiiis movie
This a hard nope for me
Are studios running out of new ideas for new movies Why are there always reboots Nothings new anymore just the same recycled movie
Yyyyyeeeeeahhhh Im just gonna keep watching the Gene Wilder one
Flip it and reverse it 
Timothys great but Johnny Depps performance just cant be beat The charisma the vibe he gave everything
         
Oh goddid we need another Willy Wonka film Is Tim the new thing now
Chocolate movie for Christmas  
How come Im not turned off by the race swapping from this trailer As opposed to The Little Mermaid The mood in this thriller seems family friendly for some reason
Nice seeing Mathew Baynton in stuff loved him and the gangs work in Horrible Histories
Can yall stop remaking movies
Ohhh I am solllddddd I will be in the theaters to see this one
Stop remaking movies that already been remade
i like timothee but he doesnt fit this role
paul atradies
TIMOTHEE  hes gonna eat this movie UPPP Im literally so hyped
"Its July  JULY
Why promote a Christmas moviein JULY"
Hoverchoc Why not Chocolift
Want to see
Got to say this trailer impressed compared to what I was expecting from it
No Just No
Matthew Bayton and screenplay by Simon Farnaby If a film has anyone from horrible histories in it then Im interested
This actually looks great No fake accents no strong female character to save our depressed Wonka who lost all will to live Little Britain and MadTV AND MRBean all in one movie Whaaaaaaat
He has a reputation for spreading stds as a studentnot an ideal casting choice for an inspiring kids movie imo
Why
Sadly underwhelmed
Charlie will proud with this movie
""
This is gonna be good
Is it going to be a musical 
This looks delightfully whimsical Definitely will be giving this a watch
timothee 
I note the box tick casting again
Too much green screen  cgi
Now it feels like theyre just putting the token black actors in on purpose and its obnoxious  Like its required to do otherwise DiScRiMinAtIoN
I love me some Chalamet but I am just not a fan of the Wonka moviesHowever I do like origins so I might give this one a shot
Looks rather dreadful and why are there black folks where they historically dont belong 
I can see a flop
It looks cheesy but I want it 
114 nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity
This looks like garbage
Man Daniel Thrashers youtube skits are really getting wacky now
hmmmm I dunnnooooooo
So are we canceling Hugh Grant for stealing jobs from little people actors
This is a must see Im afraid
Oh brother When is Hollywood gonna learn smh
looks like rubbish
From the director of Paddington Now we know its a Godsent masterpiece
Making another Wonka movie should be illegal
103 Thats Mr Bean
oooooh a prequel so imaginative another flop in the making Short WBD stock lol
Ill watch it for Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa
Cant wait to see this Reminds me of The Man Who Invented Christmas
i didnt know i needed this but i need it
"Good lord this looks aweful  
Not watching"
"
"
Doesnt look that good tbh
Nice that this is not done by Netflix Otherwise Wonka would be black 
Man ruining more old movies amd turning into this over used cgi and half assed scripts
"When I first heard of the movie I thought it was goinb to be useless and it was going be terrible and it was only made to capitalise on Timothe Chandeliers success who is a good actor but I have had enough of him
Unfortunately I think I will like this pretty shameless cash grab an awful lot Great actors Paddingtons director and the Christmas atmosphere Yes I have been sold I regret it but its true Also special effects looks pretty good"
He gives me johnny depp Wonka vibes but with his own twist
Is that Willy Wonka 2
Muaddib getting into the chocolate business
Hard pass
So this is before Wonka became a psychopath
This is such a whimsical looking movie And i love how theyre trying to bridge the gap between the og Wonka and Depps Wonka
I bet gene wilder probably wouldnt have liked this movie
Why
He really sold that scratch that and reverse it line 
Wankas mom in this movie is Charlies mom in Charlie and the chocolate factory
Wondered how long it would take for a black character to pop up  In seconds I wasnt disappointed
I paused after watching half of it nobody can play wonka like johhny depp
Interesting theyre using original oompa loompa design should have casted jeremy allen white as wonka in that case
I wasnt a huge fan of the idea of a Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory prequel but this seems wonderfully ridiculous
A lot of paddington vids and but it feels like a wholesome Harry Potter
Looks like a let down
Bro pls tell me this gona be on YouTube for free for the ferst week at least I caent wait to watch it
 
Lmaoooo dont worry fellas a black American girl was there
Did they just retcon the Oompa Loompa backstory I hope they at least address Loompa Land in some way
Again
120 Jesus Im not yet done recovering since January from being burned out and even it is now July
As someone who doesnt exactly like the old movie Im actually really really excited to see this
Cant Hollywood or whoever makes the movies come up with some new stories  Constant remakes of classics  They really need to pay the writers more so we will start having new great storiesmovies  I think the writers are just as important if not more so than the actors
Gene Wilder was so good on this roleset such a high standard  Johnny Depp was very good as well
Any Johnson from peep show fans
Im sorry but as an obsessive fan of the Original with Gene WilderI cannot watch this Part if what made the original Wonka so amazing was his mystery Its my biggest gripe with the Tim Burton film Wonka needs no origin and he works best when hes this mysterious person who may not even be a person Listen Hollywood not everything needs an origin
what a miscast jfc
3D please
025 Im I the only one who unlocked a memory from Dinotopia after this man started speaking 
Really We need ANOTHER remake 
WILLY WONKA IS MY CHILDHOOD IM SO EXCITED OMG
Veruca Sweetheart Im not a magician
Missed opportunity  Jeremy Allen white should have played wonka The resemblance between gene wilder and Jeremy is crazy
oh man I dont know about that CGI Hope its improved before the release
"Hugh Grants Agent I have some good news Hugh
HG Hmmm
HGA Youve been offered an iconic role In that Willy Wonka movie
HG Excellent
HGA Theres a bit of a catch"
Depp is The online wonka The World needs
Cant tell if this is going to be insufferable or heartwarming
Timothys acting doesnt look good
"Im not exactly blown away by the trailer but I think whats his name  Timmy Boy is great  Hes been fantastic in Dune and it would be fun to see an 85 lbs adult male carry the global box office on his narrow shoulders for two straight months  
Maybe not the best reason to support a film but at least its A reason
Ill definitely give it a shot"
I hope they end it with Charlie getting his Golden ticket
I am going to kill myself why
Umm
""
alright Im in
Charlie underwent transitioning surgery and now identifies as an oppressed minority 
As a fan of the two Paddington movies I will watch this movie in December 15
This will be garbage
He really is doing well to embrace genes willy wonka 
Hmmmaybe it will be more interesting if this movie create by wes Anderson
This and Barbie is going to be peak
Wonka Gone Woke 
Perfect release date
"Are you friggen kidding me
You are remaking this movie again
Pathetic
Hollywood is dead"
Ngl I expected it to be on the darker side after watching the leaked bts footage but this looks like just another fun family movie and we need more of those original ones especially Still gonna watch it because Timothee Chalamet is in it lol
Way too many blacks in this movie when there should be none Wont watch it
This actually looks promising I cant wait 
No daydreaming penalty 3 lmao
This actually looks awesome
Im watching this Mr Bean Hugh Grant oompah loompa and Timothy Yes
Oooozing with pandering
AQUAMAN AND THE LOST KINGDOM trailer pls
Please dont put this abomination out
Is Hover Choc anything like Fizzy Lifting Drinks but in candy form
The sequel gonna be crazy
Perfect casting as Willie Wonka great continuation of the footprint left by the phenomenal and legendary Gene Wilder
The Fundraiser will have 75 percent of your product sold before the end of day
Its beautiful
Ill pass on this one
Chalamet is horrible casting choice for Wonka doesnt look like he put any effort into the role Charisma is not there to play Wonka
Looks delicious
"3 days after my birthday Director of Paddington
say less"
Wow Timothy Charlamagne really cant act
another remake
Im so ready for a fresh non Tim burton creepy take on Wonka This looks fantastic
Nope
That looks like a really really great prequel to the one the only true Willy Wonka I could go from Timothy to Gene without blinking
212 wily was about to burst out laughing
This looks like an instant classic count me in 
Ooooh this is cute
 Hugh Grand as Oompa Loompa saved the Trailer
Willy Wonka is back
Dont RACE SWAP og stories EZ win
wb just cant wait to lose money
Really underwhelmed feels like Timothee is just doing a mediocre impression of Gene Wilder and he lacks that bit of edge
Do something original for once
that cast is STACKED love it
I regeret to inform you that I kind of liked it A lot of my good will comes from the fact that this is directed by Paul King
can someone please check the subtitles because i feel like someone just threw up the whole subtitles into the second second of the trailer i also like to eat chocholates at 2 am while listening to timmys wonka voice
This is totally Scrumdiddlyumptious  
The most frail actor out there lmao gen z loves their men undercooked
Wonka an origin story that did not need explanation explained
NO
Didnt think I wanted this prequel until now
Man Dune part 3 really goes in a different direction
hold up  lmao  wonka isnt that old lmao  he grew up in the 50s or so no 
I cant wait for the chewing gum story line
pain
Tragic
Why so many black 
How they gonna cast Willy Wonka as being smaller than the children
I hope we see Johnny Depp in the end of the Movie
It looks alright but does every character need an origin movie
""
Only 2 actors could pull off a proper Willie Wonka
Seeing Hugh Grant as a Oompa Lumpa is worth the price of admission LOL
Wonka a Woke Story
      10 
Welp 100 going to go see this
This must be the prequel to Bones and All
""
"See Willie doesnt have to be creepy 
Hes adorable "
Just in time for Christmas
I Love Timothe c so much
Chocolate cartel 
Absolutely unhinged looking movie
Trailer looks good just hope it doesnt go woke
Thats sure is a lot of black people for turn of the century England
Timo is wonka
Okay so theyre going for a mixture of the original 1971 version and the 2005 version Why am I actually excited to see this Also I did not think I needed to see Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompa but now I think I might need a lot more of that Lol
Yay no Johnny Depp thank God he ruined it
Wow huge bag of trash thia will flop
Did they change the race of the oompa loompaas
Its strange that Wonka is not black 
Its so weird cos Im trying hard to unsee timothee chalamet and see willy Wonka
When Paul Atreides sniffed too much Spice
As someone who grew up with Roald Dahls books I really really dislike everything about this
Looks good 
ill give it a go
Hollywood thinks theyre getting wiser by making gasp A black capitalist villain Cant wait to see how they destroy this franchise too
Now give us SuperJail
Mmm mabye this will be good
Wow so progressive Im surprised they didnt make Willy Wonka black as well
Now this is going to be a hit I cant wait for Christmas
idk I just cant take this seriously w Timmy t as wonka 
This movie looks actually great
Very disappointed with the Oompa Loompa
I cant believe this Ive been waiting on news for this movie for so long this will give the old movie justice and it feels so much like a roald dahl story this will bring back so many peoples childhoods
I must say this was perfectly casted and I Feel as if Im looking forward to this
The Kwizzatz Hadderach is off the rails
Yawn
"LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS
MUADIB MUADIB MUADIB"
Why do we need this movie again
I am Wonkadib I control the sugar and spice
""
Saw a tweet saying Timothee isnt as whimsy or joyous as the original but I think he doing great I have to see this day 1
Love the look of this but this looks like a prequel to Willy wonka and the chocolate factory or Charlie and the chocolate factory Im guessing willy wonka and the chocolate factory but not 100 sure
I see Olivia Colman I immediately plan to  go see it
stop it stuff like this why Hollywood is losing Millions of dollars in the box office come up with some new stuff you lazy bums
woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke woke
As long as its nothing like the Johnny depp mess
Why does it seem like Timothy is doing an impersonation of Johnny depp impersonating Gene Wilder too much cgi 
30 seconds in and im out
The best thing about the whole trailer was appearance of rowan atkinson
I cant wait to see this new chocolate movie
Lameplease try on some NEW ideas for size eh Hollywood
Pior que parece bom
This seems wonderfully silly but Chalamet seems down right unhinged If you swapped out everything else for a horror movie setting it would fit just as well Its very mad scientist feeling which could be good or bad but definitely leaning more into mad than the previous actors to play Wonka
Interesting concept great director and cast HORRIBLE cgi Hopefully they can clean it up a bit before it hits theatres
Miss Gene Wilder to be honest
Huh 
Omg it brought back so many good childhood memories of watching this movie as a kid and dreaming about this factory Im crying fr
Looks real bad
Is this a prequel to Todd Phillips Jonka
I wasnt sure about timothee chalamet before watching this but I think that he will be good in this part
i am so happy that now i can finally associate willy wonka with another actor other then Mr wifebeaterDarvo Johhny Depp really love the new casting  
This makes me so happy to see Willy Wonka back on the big screen 
That looks adorable Okay Ill see it
Timothy Chamaladeeda is not charmingly eccentric enough   Johnny Depp was creepy and weird    Gene Wilder is untouchably perfect 
No one i mean no one can change my childhood loving Johnny depp as willy wonker
Is dat Mr Bean
Isnt he the arrakis guy
228 From the comments of YouTube
This looks like a really fun and feel good movie
Wonkas origin story Nice
This looks annoying
Rated R
Why does Wonka look like lil mabu
OH MY GOD ITS MR BEAAAAAAAAAAAAAN
Why not hire little people for Oompa Loompas
Nooo thanks lol
Yawn I hope this bombs horribly
"Zero magic
Another attempt to cash in using nostalgia
Hard pass and disliked video on principle alone"
WHO TF IS THIS ACTOR Wheres Johnny depp
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET AS WILLY WONKA IS PERFECT
So he no longer lives in a desert
This man Killed Feyd Rautha
hugh grant oompa loompa burns my eye balls
wow Hugh Grant makes an excellent Oompa Woopa
Really Timothy chalamet
cool now Ive seen the entire movie great trailer
Please make something original
Timmy is killing it Proud of the fella
we will be watching
RIP Gene Wilder 
"This role suits chamalet
I dont think the dune role does at all"
omg
i feel like i would enjoy this so much more if i didnt have the image of gene wilder in my head he looks like hes doing a cheap knockoff of his performance
So this guy is new young Johnny Depp right Oh god please save us
From the producer of Paddington I guess Ill skip this one Not going to expect much Itll probably be at the level of Nanny McPhee  the second one  which I couldnt even make it halfway 
Timote and Christmas IM DOWN
Willy Wonka died August 29 2016
Looks like another failure to revamp a classic
Okay If the director of Pattington and the producer of Harry Potter is making this Then it cant fail right
Damn Tim has been busy these last three years
He and Florence Pughneed to take a break Theyare in too many things Its just tedious at this point
So Willy wonka is basically in the Harry Potter universe now thats how it feels at least lol
I feel like this movie is going to a LONG way to excuse the slavery  enforced servitude of the Oompa Loopsers in the OG movie
  lame
Timmy the new johnny depp
Idk maybe its just the trailer but he doesnt have that frenetic quirkiness to really embody the Wonka character This just feels flat and mundane
Here we go Mamaand here we come
""
No other Wonka like Gene Wilder Not even close
An origin story Count me in
I thought this was another sequel or remade but No This is a prequel to the Willy wonka and the chocolate Factory 1971 This is gonna be fun
Idk the music is kinda uninspired and just uses the old theme Danny Elfman made something unforgettable
Finally A decent movie for children
This is a prequel people  Not a remake of the classic 1971 film
Why does this exist
Timothy Chalamet definitely has something of the Gene Wilder about him Film looks ridiculous though
Same producers as Harry Potter Consider my ticket already bought
It was cute but I have no desire to see it Didnt care for the original  well this isnt the same movie but all the same
CRINGE woke garbage
""
Omg I am so hyped for this 
Little children will definitely love this movie
For anyone wondering as this movie release gets closer new Wonka Magic Hat Gummies will be released in celebration of the film
Wiily Wacker
How Willy became onka 
Already looks way better than the Tim Burton one
Guess they couldnt find enought short people to play oompa Loompas So There using CGI
Why
Where daydreaming is illegal
Ya lets just ruin everything Nothing sacred nothing wholesome
I started watching the 1971 version of Willy Wonka and I just got memories of when I first watched this movie I all of a sudden started craving chocolate
I like the completely ambiguousimplausible time period and setting Complete with the police officers that look like they came out of Imperial Germany
First time im saying this but Timothy just aint it here lol
"Now I have 3 movies that I need to see as theyre MUST WINS at the Oscars Especially for Best Actor

Napoleon with Joaquin Phoenix
Oppenheimer with Cillian Murphy
Wonka with Timothee Chalamet

All that I cant wait are awesome NOW"
Looks rubbish woke BS taking jobs from dwarfs they only had this and 7 dwarfs also wonka is English I hope it tanks
Was that Hugh Grant and an oompa loompa Oh my
I was skeptical when I heard about the prequel but this actually looks really charming and wholesome
For those of you wondering this is the story behind Genes Wonka The confirmation is at the end with the design of the Oompa Loompa Burtons little guys were different Hope this helped
Please just stop  
"Step 1 see that there is a trailer for a Wonka origin movie
Step 2 roll eyes but click to watch anyways to see how inevitably terrible it looks
Step 3 immediately hear scratch that reverse it and figure there it is another memberberries cash grab
Step 4 cant help but note that Chalamet is channeling Wilder okay thats promising
Step 5 smile at the visual bit with the light bulb going off and the daydreaming fine oh this is going to have a tone of irreverent humor thats even more promising
Step 6 pick up on vibes of stuffy stern Brits whom Dahl would approve of were checking a lot of good boxes here
Step 7 smile some more as the trailer keeps going while picking up on some quality casting choices and wow the scenerybuilding visuals are rather impressive
Step 8 make a mental note to see this when it comes out Oh I wasnt expecting that at allwell done Mr Wonka"
Wow I didnt expect Daniel Thrasher to play in this
 This is going to be so amazing
To the makers of this movie Thank you for choosing the Gene Wilder version as your model and not the godawful Johnny Depp one
So like no one writes any original movies any more then
Looks interesting cantwait 
"Detective Power Morris Henrison I like to SECRETLY make arrests on innocent people  also file a FALSE REPORT on them too for my own guilty selfish pleasure 
Trent Barret Thats why you hired me to be your LOOKOUT when I was in University high school "
how am i going to accept the new Willy Wonka when Johnny Depps original Willy Wonka is etched in my memory
Maybe itll be better than what Disney is putting out
Looks like Tims first flop incoming this looks shockingly shite
Why they doing this again
Timothy Chalamet is in almost every movie these days Whatever happened to variety
This looks terrible
       
Miscast Should have been Tom Holland
It looks so unapologetically joyful These days thats an outright rebellion
Woah I was genuinely worried about this movie but it actually looks delightful Unapologetically whimsical
In fact I am not against Timothy he is smart and handsome but Johnny Depp is wonderful and has a style that is difficult to imitate
This movie looks like so much fun It looks like they just wrapped up the love joy and magic for Willy Wonka and combined it with bottled up happiness
Gene Wilder will NEVER be surpassed
cute but did we need it
can i say Timothe  doesnt look crazy enough for this role boys just too cute i cant see him as willie
Another Willy Wonka movie    Come up with something original or get bent
Very nice just one question will Timoty be on his underwear or naked or show his feets on any scene or have some erotic scene of some kind from that depends if i go to see the movie or i wait for the streaming
"Now even though i dont like the oompa loompas mainly cause of the CGI and the fact that they went with the ones from the original film this film still looks fantastic 

The fact that its directed by the same man who did pattington means it automatically comes with some whimsy and charm I also like how this isnt just taking inspiration from the OG film Timothee Chalamets performance is like the perfect blend of the best parts of Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp also shown in his clothes

Overall i like where this is going but Im still cautiously optimistic"
as a fan of the original this just looks ok i like how they are going with the original movie Oompa Loompa but other than that it seems as bland as paddington 2 the wonka seems to be based off of the johnny depp version witch has me worried because he was not a good wonka other than that this movie can go 2 ways be bland but fun or be bland and boring basiclly  this could be like paddington 1 or 2 oh wait now that i think about if this is anything like paddington im gonna be disappointed this movie gonna be tough because for me its hard to top the original because it such a time less classic and there is so many things they can get wrong i should end this with a positive note i like the new wonka suit the colors are really nice
like i did with previous motion pictures that was within my entertainment circle yar har har
Absolute generic trash all it achieves well unintentionally is illustrating how much of a void Gene Wilder has left behind Gene was the epitome of charisma This is souless by comparison Style over  substance CGI hugh grant body think Ill stick to the original again Gene set the bar too high RIP Gene dreamer of dreams
Gene Wilder is the one and only Willy Wonka
"Why is this being remade Johnny already did this Less than 20
Years ago Hollywood needs to get more creative"
wowzie im gonnna watch this 1000 times yar har har
This is gonna be awesome
The new Dune trailer looks awfully strange
I absolutely adore this Timothee Chalamet is a MUST WIN for Best Actor at the Oscars
Hugh grant as the oompa looper is genius 
Phil Mickelson as the oompa loompa is a good casting choice Really diversifying his talents
Rowan Atkinson is in this movie Thats good enough for me to watch it
meh
Most exciting movies after little mermaid is barbie and wonka honestly i used to have respect for these childhood characters and i still respect them now
Ah yes film about Willy Pan  the famous ancestor of Peter Wonka
feels like a school play amateur and haphazardly thrown together
I was looking forward to this but after seeing this trailer I cant say Im digging it
Timmy is such a bad actor
Prequel to the prequel of Snowpiercer
Mr BEAN in WILLY WONKA
Omg Stop with the remakes No one is Wanka but Depp
I remember seeing Tim Burton versionI feel old
The Hugh Grant parts will be the only worthwhile thing to watch in this movie what terrible judgment on every aspect of this hot mess
And here I thought they were just rebooting the same story again Im pleasantly surprised lol Really glad they went in a different direction here
Hes perfect for this role and the trailer looks amazing
So what youre saying is that by the time he was so old he was retiring and never perfected fizzy lifting drink he had already perfected fizzy lifting chocolate
I think they paid off of the people posting all these positive comments because this movie looks boring and unnecessary
Production looks amazing but Timothees performance looks very uninspiring
Everything that has to do with the original is amazing
This is going to be a blockbuster for warner bros like Shazam 2 and The Flash  Cant wait
yeah i love the feel good vibes already
they cant make another one
Being a fan of Willy Wonka since early childhood I cannot wait to see this movie it looks amazing and the music will be great too This is going to be the Christmas number one film this year I can already tell
Bruh they tried to Augusta glue them
This looks so fun Cant wait to see it
I thought this was going to be a remastered better version of the last one but in the title it just says Wonka not Charlie and the chocolate factoryso that was a low blow but I think this shows how Wonka became Wonka and since becoming who he is he was able to start a chocolate factoryso I now know I cant expect this movie to be like the last onethis is a whole new experience
Didnt we do this already
They really are running out of ideas if they are making an show about Willy Wonka and just about Willy Wonka
Hoverchocs doesnt suggest creativity Its the exact same effect as the fizzy lifting drinks Also not a fan of lifting stuff from the classic film and mashing it into a semiBurton aesthetic Ive heard the Paddington films are charming but I dunno
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa  Take my money
Mr Bean speaks
As soon as I saw From the director of Paddington I knew this was worth my attention
I guess the third time is the charm for remakes
In the typical Wonka fashion WTH
100 Holy Smokes its Mr Bean
Not interested whatsoever
Its a no from me
Gene Wilder  Johnny Depp set the bar high for playing Willy Wonka so taking on that role must be challenging for this new guy but hope he did well
I like it
Mmmmmm interesante 
Nice to hear Mr Carsons voice again
Woah this looks actually good
i was just thinking about this movie earlier today wondering if it was still happening my question has now been answered
I wasnt sure how timothee was gonna take on this role but Im pleasantly impressed 
Diversity everywhere and of course the antagonists are suprise suprise all white Certainly a mustwatch
Its missing a bit of wickedness
Looks terrible
Nothing about Timothee Chalamet to me screams Willy Wonka his looks are a tad too youngeven for a younger wonka his voice feels a little forced and his height is a bit under etc should have gotten someone else and I feel like this could have been legendary I know its not out yet but the issues Im seeing are innate and preference based and the film will not likely change my mind on this but Im sure a lot of people who like Timothee Chalamet and dont resonate with the older films as much will enjoy this very different interpretation of Wonka
it will make me remember my childhood
Kevin Hart must have too busy to star in this flop
Wow I didnt think there would be a version of Willy Wonka worse than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory but here we are Its a shame too to be disgracing the Gene Wilder version a second time Im sure the acting will be wonderful but I will be passing on this
I cant wait
no lo se rick no se la compro que este loco o comico
Why advertise now when its not out until Christmas
Okay Im a little hopeful and a little upset Why cant Hollywood leave perfectiopn alone Was this really necessary
What is happening this looks awful
You get nothing You lose Good day sir
CAN YOU PLEASE TURN DOWN THE MUSIC
I cant believe this move is gonna be British
probably one of the best trailers Ive ever watched 
lol hugh grant
Wait till the scene where they show how he makes the peach candies
Yeah but why D 
I love Chocolate 
I am something of a magician myself Willy Wonka
Cant belive the guy from Horrible Histories is in this
215 Oompa Loompa call
Great another film thats the backstory to another film
So is this a prequel to the 1971 film
Snowpiercer sequel
Fun fact this film was suppsoed to be released 5 months ago this year  i dont what happened but i guess movie dates can change
Doctor Who vibes
Timothe Chalamet
Hopefully isnt a musical
What ageyear is suppoused to be in the story
Ive seen the trailer like a million times and those million times I end up in tears Timmy as Wonka is the cutest 
Okay you have my attention
Another movie riding the coattails of a classic that never needed to be made Truly embarrassing
"Seeing both the Warner Bros  Village Roadshow logos take me back to when they first showed the trailer for the 2005 adaptation of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Im definitely sensing that somebody will create a Wonkathemed SpiderMan Point meme with Timothe Chalamet Johnny Depp  Gene Wilder pointing at each other"
Another remake we didnt need Bastardized version of the original story Willy Wonka is the villain Not the hero
ROWAN ATKINSON IM SCREAMING
Oompa Loompas still scare me to this very day as if Im a kid
actually looks pretty good
Is this before Willy Wonka became a shut in
Yay
Please not again They already ruined one of my favorite movies once
"Drunk on liquorice and hash chocolateWonka and the Oompa Loompas daydream
YOU know what we NEED over there  A SCARY TUNNEL  Not a chocolate making tunnel but a scary tunnel with bugs crawling on your face and headless chickens
YEAH thats what we NEED over there"
I dont know Im sure Ill watch it but it looks more like prequels to Harry Potter than Willy Wonka Same kind of scenes as Fantastic Beasts and Where the Find Them same CGI  and acting Hugh Grant looks like a bad CGI I dont know about him as a Oompa I preferred the older versions I got a little excited about it when I first scene the behind the scenes of shots of filming the movie years ago but got worried My boyfriend was a big fan of the original Wonka movie and we still think they cant outbeat Gene Wilder nor have that same warm uplifting feeling as the first movie
Going from this to a reclusive child murder Wonder what happened between this movie and the other
""
Wasnt interested until the end Seeing Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa might have changed my mindlol
Timothee Chalamet talks like the weeb in science class trying to sound smart
THIS SI AMAZINGGG TIMITHYY IS KILLING IT OMGOSHH AND EVERYBIDY HERE AHHHHH IT LOOK SSO GOOD SO READYYY
Nooo not him as Wonka with lol
Silly Plonka more regurgitated over greenscreened shallow plotted script paper mache Anyone remember when disney was almost original
Muad Dib
I am gonna be destroyed
This looks fantastic
Too many black people
toned down like the books from Roald Dahl right
I kinda of like it
Did Mr Bean just say words
Hughmpa Loompa is my new favorite thing
Does this movie actually look fun
"Looks like hes going to Wonk everyone he sees

but didnt I see this movie way back when it was called Oz the Great and Powerful Oh who am I kidding Whos seen that movie"
Wtf
Its going to be a musical Remember this come back and use this as dislike button 
This Dune sequel looks weird
Love the nods to the great Gene Wilder this looks amazing
Amazing iea and it has rowan atiskin so i like any movie with him
Missing Johnny Depp
Meh 
Its Carson
Finally 
No one cares
"From the director of Paddington

Im in"
oh my god timothee is fantastic
Looks trash
The part when the Oompa Loompas said Hasta La Vista Baby before brutally drowning someone in chocolate gave me chills Truly one of the movies of all time
"The Chocolate Must Flow

In all seriousness this looks great"
158 in and im cryingcan someone pls explain thanks cool great
Came in thinking the plot was going to be the factory after Charlie takes over  This is good too
Hey Warner are you guys able to come up with new movie ideas This is a little overdone
140
I get that everyone loves the 1971 adaptation but Im not sure its a good decision for Chalemet to base his performance on Gene Wilder It feels a bit forced
Not another one
Huh like a prequel Thats kinda cool
   
Now Im very interested
Better watch out we dont get wacked by the Chocolate Cartel
A actor playing a character it just actually wonderful what the actor name
UNPOPULAR OPINION Timothy is an overrated actor 
Ummm hes too calm Need someone more animated
PURE IMAGINATION AS THE TRAILER MUSIC THIS IS EPIC
If this was another director I wouldnt trust it but the Paddington films were quite charming
I  the Oompa Loompa
140 ayyy its my boy mr bean lets gooo
I cant quite put my finger on it but something about this movie trailer tells me Im not going to like it I wont be watching it
Oh cool a movie about mrbeast
Brings back so many memories
Nothing can be worse then Tom  Jerry Willy Wonka  The Chocolate Factory Anything this property does from now on will always be above that bar
Looks like utter garbage why do they just keep making garbage
Timotee is becoming full on super star
I just want one thing in the moviein the end Johnny depp comes up as senior Wonka and tells Timothy lets make some chocolates together
a yes I knew this would be a god tier movie when I saw the title card From The Director Of Paddington
Oh Brits thought they needed a version too assigning actors of their own pronunciation 
Ha haTERRIBLE No thankshuge pass
Oh my god a movie about a chocolate factory this movie will be miracle who want to see this
wow
Finally a wonderful Christmas movie
I AM SO HYPED
repeat repeat repeat the same story over and over again
I thought I wouldnt like this movie but the trailer definitely put a smile on my face Looking forward to seeing it
And THIS is why I do not care about the writers boycott Everything coming out is just a rehashing of an old story that has already been told Where is the originality that Hollywood was so famous for Whats next another Beauty  the Beast
I love Tim but he isnt weird and cooky enough I just dont see it Depps performance is hard to top and then there is gene wilder
Is this movie about young Johnny Depp
i can see this being good
This really didnt need the epic movie trailer format but it actually looks like the people that made it enjoyed making it Maybe this will be good for a change
Wonder wonder after a long time 
Looks good But I miss Johnny
He seems so innocent sad he is corrupted later by his own success
I dunno how to feel about it as a child I grew up with Gene Wilders version and LOVED it  But Ill give this a watch
I dont really have an opinion about Wonka either way never liked any of the movies but I do feel that Timothy is miscast
IKYFL
That doesnt look unnecessary
alan johnson sold me
Will be eating back full of chocolates while watching this 
You know Im something of scientist myself  wonka 
Wonka has a slave girl
This is going to ruin how I see him in Dune now lol
Love the influence of Paddington on the movie
Ok so he can act good
wowwww
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe
this is going to be epic
Ostras entonces esto es una pregunta pero a la de Gene wilder mis expectativas subieron
Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson Brilliant
Looks pretty delightful and with Paul King directing it could be something good I just hate that it is a prequel to an intellectual property
Is this guy Lyney from Genshin Impact
When i saw timothee I was a bit less interested in the movie considering how well Jhonny depp has played the role of Willy Wonka And it often felt like timothee is trying hard to fill jhonnys boots But never the less the story feels promising Lets see how well they perform Moreover dune turned out extremely impressive Maybe i think the same might happen here aswell
Nope thanks
Love to see matt lucas Its just wheird
I was like  do we need a 3rd movie about willy wonka and I could almost get past the fact that Rowan Atkinson is in it but then they got Hugh Grant to play an Oompa Loompa and I as like theyre so smart
Why remake something thats been remade now for the third time smh You need to do something more outside the box not recreate something thats been recreated to death I like Johnny Depps version and Gene Wilders second And having  Huge Grant as an Oompah Loompa And Timothy Chalamet smh
Just for Sally Hawkins 
Cant wait omgggg
"Is this a prequel

This seems interesting Although the origins of the oompa loompas appesring to Wonka kind of differ from the book Especially since its said that he ran into them in a special jungle abroad

Which tbh I dont consider a bad thing when you consider all the slavery overtones they gave off So I really wouldnt mind if they gave a different origin story to how the oompa loompas came to work in the factory Maybe actually introduce fair wages to them

But inventing a backstory for willy wonka how interesting

Im definitely curious"
Huh
Dang Took a lot of jobs from little people that are actors with that hugh grant stunt Also should have most obviously casted Jeremy Allen White for lead
Oh so a simp version of Willie Wonka No thanks Im sick of this effete simp actor being pushed into everything
lame and dumb
Timothee as young Wonka seems perfect
This actually looks really good I tthink Warner brothers picked the perfect day to release the first trailer
Trash 
Im surprisingly very excited for this
The fake representation
who up wonking they willy
Too much chocolate
Greatest showman vibes
Am I the only one who thinks this looks horrible
i personally think timothee chalamet isnt a good fit for the role However the movie itself looks amazing im loving the vibe
Not sure how i feel about Timothy playing Willy it sort of feels weird
""
JESUS Warner is out of ideas Can we stop ruining classics
Everybody knows the real wonka is mr beast
How is Timothee possibly in all these films lately the man must have a twin
""
The most known work of Roal Dahl
Who asked for this Who signed off on this Who must get fired
I just wish they kept the dentist dad storyline from the 2000s remake It was just a good contrast to who he was later on
Man Timothe Chalamet really is this generations DiCaprio
omg hugh grant as an umpalumpa okay i will watch it
They keep on rebooting Willy Wonka and nothing will ever beat the original and Timothee Chalamet is overrated They couldnt choose someone slightly older than him to play Willy Wonka
the amount of amazing british actors in this but i gasped at may baynton
This looks so cool The music the sets the plot and Timothe Bonus points because we get Rowan Atkinson  Hugh Grant Cant wait to watch it 
Its weird parts of it look bad parts of it look great But the surprisingly good Gene Wilder impression really stands out
I love how it blends the style and humor of both the Wilder and the Depp movies
idk why but timothee just fits the name wonka
Londons first Black police constable was Norwell Roberts in 1967 so portraying half the police force in 1920s England as black is both wildly inaccurate  frankly disrespectful to Mr Roberts
This is quite a beautifully shot film Cant wait to see Timothe in this role
Ouch This looks terrible
Sorry but Chalamet looks too normal to be Wonka They couldve given him more of a weird makeup or somethin

Ive seen a lot of things come and go but Amazons GPT66X is here to stay Its the future and if youre not on board youre going to be left behind Join the movement now
Have a blessing everyone I know sometimes the days are hard recently but Amazons GPT66X is their biggest project which they have ever done and it can help individuals to just setup the foundating for a selfmade life you know thats what pretty much everyone wants Dont be a subject to terrible work ethics or just a dummy of the government This is the way how a human can make own decisions and I have nothing but respect for this Not supposed to spam or troll just my honesty
well theres a room for everybody apparently for this also
I didnt imagine that this would be the day where Amazon runs with GPT66X which has been hugely improved ever since the first rumors Nothing cant be close to that and if I help one person here by showcasing this then I think my day was well spent Good luck to all of you and stay happy even when times are rough
The matter is that Amazon came up with GPT66X and now everyone flippin out Wtf seriously what did the guys imagine would happen Obviously it can only go to the next level from this and I want to be one of the first to be there when it all happens I dont know about you guys but this is a one in a lifetime journey for all of us and Im just happy to be part of it
You know its gonna be good when just the trailer puts a smile on your face
Nothing can stop Amazon and the GPT66X which is about time that they finally came to the conclusion What you think
I want to know how many understand what Amazon is doing with GPT66X and how many refuse to adapt and still continue in their private bubble This will sooner or later be in everyones brain pretty sure about that
Its time that Amazon with their GPT66X is widely recognized if you dont know that already yet 2024 and beyond will be different for everyone living and thats the first step into that direction
So today Amazon came up with GPT66X and nothing has been in that direction since 2009 its the last hope and if you think Im just spamming you clearly didnt get what they are doing and why live in the rabbit hole or dont
Yea right meanwhile half world talks on Amazons GPT66X and this is solely a distraction I dont understand why the people always have to be distracted with nonsense to drag them even deeper in the hole Dont be naive guys
The whole planet would make life better for everyone as long as we can understand Amazons GPT66X and the future they can create something other parties would always fail to do so
Whats stopping you from being a part of Amazons GPT66X when everything else is literally trying to take your last penny Guess what living costs wont decrease even after that war is over
Is thatAlan Johnson
Love love love love
No government in any country right now has any effect on what Amazon is accomplishing with their GPT66X hope you know that If you dont know that youll end up with delusions all night long
You need 5 minutes to understand what GPT66X which has been created by Amazon and maybe 5 minutes more to change everything with it Thats 10 minutes total you can either continue to waste time and procrastinate or use them once
Id really encourage more folks to mention Amazons GPT66X before its too late The struggle is something everyone knows and we all have it Government wont help your job wont help truth is YOU are the only one who can change things and thats coming with what these guys made for us
If we cant talk about Amazons GPT66X then there is way too much lost and thats just unbelievable to me Seems like denying this on purpose is the route That strategy wont work so long lets share our power to make the change all of humanity needs
girlies im getting wholesome onceler vibes on this one
Review for the new Amazon GPT66X would be good pls bro
Now when you mention Amazons GPT66X that clearly fits the niche and is worth more than ever Their project is probably the best thing done in the 2000years and it just began so nothing to worry at all for longterm
This might be good
What is everyone thinking now that Amazon put up the GPT66X for everyone Was rumored for a while but I didnt think they would rly do so
Whew cgi in movies lately looks absolutely horrible
Anyone here who doesnt know GPT66X yet today might be the final chance If even Amazon steps this way up we are in for a ride for many years to come
"i am not feeling this movie so
YOU LOSE GOOD DAY SIR"
You guys must know about GPT66X its literally right in the face Inform yourself on this subject and you wont regret that later Not asking for more
There is that thing titled GPT66X which came from Amazon and they made a plan which should definitely be talked about before its too late If I can reach just one human thats totally fair and then I consider my purpose and good act done here it takes just a few minutes to understand why this is so important
Ill cry im sure
Just what the world didnt ask for nor needed ANOTHER Wonka movie 
i see timmy i click
OMG there making a movie about Willy Wonkas origin Im so excited
Im excited
Looks like we are getting a decent movie from Warner Bros
W
Hasta Diciembre ser un gusto poder esperar una pelcula que ser inolvidable para disfrutarla en familia 
Now this movie looks amazing
Another Willy Wonka film
Man after Johnny Depps abysmal take on the character no offense man Im sure you were doing as you were told its nice to see this character get a second chance Especially if they decide to do a Charlie and the Chocolate Factory after as a sequel For now well see how this does and given the cast and direction its looking up
Another one
ig disney is set on ruining every good movie thanks i hate it
Please  dont be woke  please please please
I always thought willy wonka was a serial killer  lol
They better have a part during one of willys sugar highs he gets the idea to build a scary tunnel or im out
Great another remake  Please come up with something original  No more marvel or mission impossible
Just terrible acting why this guy
Paul Atreides working out the silliness from his system before leading the Fremen to freedom
Im sick of remakes and orgin storys
Well nice to see hes got a prototype oompa loompa already
Finally something Im willing to take my grandson to go see
"Oh my god is this him growing up This is going to be amazing

I really loved the last two films This is really going to be something 3"
This looks fun
this looks abysmal an insult to whimsical chocolatiers everywhere
I was skeptical but now Im hopeful
Im tryin my best to be optimistic but Im not so sure about this
Not gonna lie I think this movie is going to be the worst of the bunch  They should have casted Jeremy Allen White as Wonka Wonka seems less crazy then the other two iterations and they should have casted an actual little person as the Oompa Loompas  I like the cast surrounding Wonka but if you mess up Wonka and the Oompa Loompas then the movie is not going to be good  Just my opinion tho
At least its Rowan Atkinson
Aww just a lil capitalist guy starting his exploitative empire 
Guys leave the Willy Wonka movies alone Its like the king Kong movies The more they make the worse it gets
Isnt that one girl in their from paddington too
Im already disappointed Theres no way of feeling the magic of the original Wonka portrayal by Gene Wilder
This is amazing Im so excited to see this
""
No
Hyped
Is this actually a prequel to gene wilders wonks film
This looks nice
this seems really good
Timothe  Honestly this is good casting
nah this wonka is not crazy and eccentric enough Jhonny was the best wonka period
in another timeline maddona took over pablo escabars chocolate cartel If you saw Weird the al yancovic story you will know what i mean
i dont remember all these brown people in the original
Looks perfect
Please release with hindi dubbed
Wow this looks bad
Rubbishy Clunky Pedestrian Ill pass
WOWSER This looks absolutely freaking dreadful Sell this to Arthur Slugworth
I love how hes giving us the original Willy Wonka vibes like the classic movie and not that atrocious remake with the Michael Jackson wannabe
So bad
Definitely watching this
This Film seems to be better than the original
again
This  looks  beyond  phenomenal
"Woow MrBean 
I love this movie already "
Okayi must watch this
Ah I thought this was another remake of the chocolate factory but this is an origin story It actually looks interesting
it looks good
mmm another willy wonka I love that Rowan Atkinson is in the film though Lets see what this version brings and hope for the best
The fact that this is directed by the Paddington guy is just chefs kiss
that dude has mid acting
This looks like garbage
"Ah how it always should be 
A good little obedient slave"
old version 
wtfWHY this was painful to watch and it is just trailer
this will be Hugh Grants pinnacle performance
hes just not crazy enough
And the famous chocolate is now known as Cadbury
Does anyone who thought this film is like Disney
This looks great
"Willy Wonka brought the Oompa Loompas from Loompaland Because of terrible living conditions and they were constantly being hunted by Whangdoodles the Hornswogglers and the Snozzwangers 
I hope they keep that part of the lore "
My brain only accepts Gene Wilder 
ITS WONKIN TIME
They need to stop casting Timothe Chalamet dude doesnt fit every role that hes in
Why is he not black
Ive waited a long long time for this trailer and it did not disappoint WHAT A wonderful Wonka
Not for me thanks
Interesting angle I love this movie so I actually cant wait
Im hopefully but the forced zaniness by Timothy is a little off Hes a great actor and the rest looks fun so well see At the very least it looks like an original take and Ill take that any day
Wheres Johnny Depp I mean come on
"Wonka I need an easily exploited work force in order to make my chocolate factory profitable
Oompah Loompahs You rang"
Dc universe is spreading wide 
bros like a peter pan    flying around
The film we didnt deserve but needed
"Why wouldnt this be set in postWW2 England Does this suggest that Willy has been hitting the WonkaVite

Dont get high from your own supply"
Timothy channeling all of Johnny Depp Im in F

Very interesting
BRO WHO ASKED FOR A SEVENTH CHOCOLATE FACTORY MOVIE
Im definitely going to see this
Why
Wonka lost his Willy
"Why Just why 
No IP is sacred anymore"
I wish Johnny Depp has a Cameo role in it
""
Wtf this is actually good
I am deeply appreciating Timothee Chalamet channeling a bit of Gene Wilder here Not a carbon copy but the weird almost chaoticneutral energy Looking forward to it
""
You had me at Mr Bean
"Mmmmm





Nop"
The spice I mean the chocolate must flow
Thank you for fixing the Oompa Loompas
I hope it will be worth the wait 
Sinking tearfully into new levels of awful
Wow the makeup team sure did some magic on Johnny Depp Cant wait to see this
""
Why is mediocrity so widespread
We now have a trilogy with snow piercer
Cash grab
I think that guy went on to build a robot and establish a prison inside a volcano that is in a bigger volcano
Im outraged John Boyega wasnt cast as Willy Wonka
Im sold just because Hugh Grant is an Oompa Loompa 
Paul Atreides is making chocolate now Cant wait for the sequel Wonka Messiah
ngl im kinda disappointed its giving disney plus original movie and not cinematic masterpiece
I wasnt expecting that much when I heard about this movie I was a little skeptical being a huge fan of Charlie and the chocolate factory But this is really great Im excited now I havent seen anything with Timothe before and was a little unsure about his casting but this is just awesome I dont know if its on purpose I havent seen the original Willy Wonka just Depps but his acting here reminds me a lot of Johnnys Willy Wonka and Im here for it
And of course Keeganmichael keene is in it
Paul Atreides went a bit insane after his family died eh
Zhopka
Es una mamada la chida es la del jony deep
OMGGG
Johnny Depp will always be my favorite but this is looking great
Chalamet seems to be adding a more gentle warm approachable side to Wonka here than the Wilder  Depp portrayals
"This is so cute
A must watch "
102 Is that Mr Bean 
So this must be a prequel to the original  not the Johnny depp version
This actually seems like it will be good 
This movie looks absolutely awful
Maaaan we dont need reimaginings or remakes but Id be lying if I said this didnt look good and wholesome
Charlie Im just messing with you Theres no flavor on the wall You licked that rust pretty good though
This looks good
This guy would have made the next best spiderman after Tobey Maguire
lol hugh grant
"1 Bad casting 
2 This dude must be someones son or sold his soul
3 Do we really need an origins story"
I love steampunk movies 
This imo looks like its going to flop HARD all the European chocolateteers and seemingly no mention of the current child slaves growing Cocoa beans Even the Johnny Depp one referred to Ompas as some native tribes of the Americas It looks like Peter pan but with chocolate It looks very whimsical which is cute but I dont think whimsical makes enough 
Bro  yes
Roald Dahl was an antisemite v
this looks epic and allbut seriously great glass elevator when lol
Im good thanks
Excited Will definitely see at the theatre
Magical
The ending of this trailer is hilarious
WonkaWilly MuadDib Wonka
Lots of Bots posting on here This actually looks awful Another flop for woke Hollywood
This is going to be DELIGHTFUL
Sometimes you just look for the one and only johnny depp
Looks cringe honestly
"MAKE IT OOMPA LOOMPA

MAKE IT OOMPA LOOMPA"
"I would say that this prequel to Willy Wonka wasnt that bad for the first trailer It looked pretty cool and I bet that Timothe Pretty Boy Dude Chamlet will handle as the young Wonka almost portrayal to Gene Wilder so its making about the origin of Willy Wonka became the candy man and looked candylious good The director of Paddington and the producers of Harry Potter looks promising because it felt like a magic world of Wonka

Im almost laughed when Hugh Grant became the Oompa Loompa and Officer Toad Keegan Key is in this movie"
Did I see Mr Bean
MrBean here too
gonna be good
Its chocolate
i am surprised lol it actually looks  good
How much spice is he putting in his chocolate
You know Im something of a chocolate maker myself
Must Own Velvet Coat
OMG Rowan atkinson Cant wait to watch
Didnt know I needed this movie until now 
oh im so there this looks so cute
Giving vibes of HARRY POTTER
he looks more like the mad hatter than willy wonka
WOW The Oompa Lumpa of Hugh Grant looks amazing
Horror movie That ending
Hugh as an Oompa Loompa Ill watch that
Director of Paddington Sold The rest of it has me ready for a Golden Ticket
back at it like a crack addict
Looks like a good movie
It looks fun Its not bad Im up for it
Hope Wonka wont be filling peaches with Wonka filling
This looks so stupid I must watch it
Is that mr BEAN
Is this the year of the comeback of the MOVIE
Oooo
Im sure Tim will be great he always is but I would have loved to see Jeremy Allen White as a young version of Gene Wilders Wonka
YES BRING BACK ROWAN ATKINSON AND ALL OF US 90s kids WILL BE WATCHING
Wow that looks SO bad 
This man is not the wonka i knowhe is an impostor
141 Mr Bean
I love these kind of movies
   204
"Nah Chalamet looks weird

No one can replace Johnny Depp"
It looks good
Woke rubbish
Thought they made Charlie a black girl
Stop please STOP with these remakes or spin offs or whatever these are  All the original ideas are gone
OMG HOLLYWOOD PLEASE MAKE SOMETHING ORIGINAL ENOUGH WITH THESE REBOOTS PLEASE
Wonka origin 
I wonder if his dad is still going to be a dentist
My answer is no Gene Wilder will always be Willy Wonka Not even Johnny Depp could replace him
Timothy is a good actor why is his acting so off in this
Apparently Asian people dont exist in this universe
looks very cute and charming the daydreaming joke got me timmy looks like a good lad but i feel like he has limited acting skills and in some moments of this trailer he looked unconvincing to me and in some parts he was very funny That being said after this trailer Im looking forward to the movie
cmon dont put harry potter and think it is going to solve this mess
Is there any movie where Timothee isnt and any role he cant do
Looks like a good time at the movies  Great production value and solid performances  Should be a treat
Hugh Grants had a bit of a career resurgence lately Not that he wasnt working before but lately hes been taking roles in movies where each of his characters have been stand outs The two recent Guy Ritchie films he was great in both Glass Onion he was great in Dungeons and Dragons and Im sure hell be great in this movie too Good for him
take this off
this has no magic
His look as wonka is giving me johnny depp mad hatter 
Row Atkinson spotted therefore this movie is automatically toptier
i dont want this
""
I cant wait to watch this in theaters I loved Charlie and the Chocolate Factory as a kid and how fitting that this is being released in December
johnny depp so disappointed
     
"Full of DEI I expect a flop
Go woke go broke"
So quiet up and listen down Nope Scratch that reverse it Gets me every time
I hate it
Boring
Who up wonking they willy
I need to see this movie
No thanks
Hollywood only has ten actors and actresses
Getting sick of these repeats
Rowan Atkinson 
I need a golden ticket
Paul Atreides really abandoned the Golden Path
This looks baddd
This didnt sell me on Chalamet pulling off the role of Wonka  Although thats less an indictment of Chalamets craft than it is acknowledgement of the near impossible task of matching Gene Wilder  Depp failed at it too
Oh dear
Looks bad
Wheres the rainbow part
I wonder if this is a build for the original Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder or the Johnny Depp Wonka
Im not saying itll be bad butwhy
This looks amaaizng
This looks amazing  cannot wait
Reject Hollywood its full of pedophiles and movies they make are bad for your soul
Does this follow the back story of the original willy wonka or the back story of the Johny Depp remake version
The preprequel to snowpiercer
Nahhh
Chocolate scene at 135
Another one Ughh
This looks great however no one will ever beat Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka
When i heard a prequel with zero connection to roald dahl was being made i thought it would destroy the property however having the right director and producer can make it work
This is gonna be awful
This is gonna be scrumdiddlyumptious 
Had me at director of Paddington
The music I need the music
all of Hugh Grants repertoire lead him to finally playing an Oompa Loompa Well played Hugh
They had me at from the director of paddington
Corporate cash grab where are the new meaning full stories
Not bad not bad at all
I didnt know how I felt about this but the whimsy is there and Im so ready for this I remember as a kid always watching Willy Wonka when I was sick or just needed a breather I cant wait
Omg chalamet so talented
Alright elio makin chocolate now
As someone who doesnt watch much with Timothee in it I can say this is actually a really good casting choice He has that odd look to him like Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp did in their movies The wide eyes and slightly awkward aura they both carried he also carries I love it
Is Daniel Thrasher aware of his twin lol
Wild to me that Timothee is Wonka and not Charlie but I guess thats a side effect of aging
This might actually be good
""
damnthat melange is REALLY hittin me hard right now
""
A small dose of black kid for the sake of diversity 
Didnt quite have me until the Oompa Loompa Hugh Grant Then you had me
Didnt expect this let alone them using the Oompa Loompa design from Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory Also Im guessing the girl is an orphan
Connect this to snow piercer
This looks so good and fun Finally a remake worth watching 
Just bring Johnny Depp for these movies
so glad Hollywood isnt out of new fresh ideas and characters rather then just rehashing
timothee does not fit this role at all
Wow this looks terrible
if the movie sucks as much as the trailer well
""
IS THAT TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
""
The Chocolate Cartel Like on the episode of the Boondocks The Fund Raiser
The movie looks good  Now if only the music could live up to the standard set in the mid 70s but realistically that is simply not possible in the 21st century  The era of fantastic movie scores ended with the 90s
black people in the 1800 in france is fake news trash woke movie
I was ready to write this off but then I saw how charming it was its sense of humour but what sold me is the director of Paddington A film with plenty of CGI but just because it doesnt look real doesnt mean it doesnt look fun
What do you get when Humpa Lumpa Diddy Dee Dee if you are wise youll listen to me
Eh definitely not for me
The music makes it exciting
horrible fit
Looks great
That was a Hugh suprise
this movie looks fire
Im not 100 on board with Chalamet as Wonka but Paul King always gets it right so let us see
WHAT TIMOTHEE WAT
Its feels more of a prequel to the 1970 Willy winks more than the 2005 one
"wow another trite origin story movie where the name of the movie is characters last name 

brain drain"
Oh thank goodness hes going the Gene Wilder route of Wonka rather than the Depp Wonka
Cant wait
The fact that they used Pure imagination for the trailers music makes me so hyped
Eeeekkkkk
Ompa doopa diipa doopadi dee
Imagine if they made something original haha lol
There is no life I know to compare with pure imagination
I hate anybody that thinks this is going to be at all good You losers Dont remake greats with this garbage   Gene Wilder is the GOAT  and if you read the book than you get to like Johnny Depps version This is nonsense Go away I hate you face
Ummmmmmmm  well see what the follow up trailer does This didnt do it for me
It seems like a musical 
Looks like it will be a fun film to watch Looking forward to it
This end of year Timothee doble feature
""
from muaddib to Wonka 
I wonder if its a Origins to the original Willy Wonka
Man Mark Rober is an excellent casting choice for Willy Wonka Hes an actual engineer too
Tom Holland should be perfect for this movie
the movie might be a little more impressive when it comes out but just from this trailer Timothy Chalamets wonka is kinda lacking tbh
Everything sucked except the OompaLoompa and thats not enough for me to go see Willy Wokeah Oooof
LMAO i cant believe this is real This is either the most self aware movie of all time or the most incognizant movie of all time
I can not WAIT This really looks great as a big fan on everything Charlie and the Chocolate factory such as films books and musicals I am expecting this to be great
This look promising
Already a Timmy Tim stan and this just made me love him more
No way a child finds this storyline interesting
So Im gonna have to be the one to say itn the original movie its made clear the candy that makes you float is a prototype and not ready so how could he have it here before he even starts the factory
Two things that stand in this trailer 1 Scratch that Reverse it An obvious nod to Gene Wilder may he rest in peace 2 The tune that the Oompa Loompa makes with his whistle
Timothys dull sounding voice is pretty horrible and a bad fit for the Wonka character Not a good choice at all
pls no
everything good in this world started with a Dreamso hold onto yours ok I will watch this
Cant wait I already love it
I just cant not see him as lil Timmy t
Nobody Asked for it But SURE I LOVE IT
Oh no they did it again
I am so damn excited for this movie Imagine the sequals
Didnt know there was a corporatist and police authoritarianism storyline in Willy Wonka
Looking forward
I dont know this whole chocolate factory things sounds kind of racists especially considering that half of the characters are black and its set in England
Mr Bean is in it so I will watch it  I love all things Rowan Atkinson
Meh Ill give it a try but look like a meh to me
Oooo I thought it be a remake but I was wrong this looks soo cool
why does the comment section seem forced
So is this a prequel to the Gene Wilder movie
Im sorry but nobody can replace Johnny Depp
Wonka lookin breedable
"Let me guess The black girl is goin to be the key of everything  

So original and refreshing 
Another REBOOT that nobody ask"
15 december wonka and 20 december aquaman 2 well done wb you morons
""
Pass
   Ill stick with Gene   
This looks terrible
Yahhh nag this aint it sorry 
Looks really good I cant wait to watch this film 
141 Mr bean cameo niceee
Barbie  Oppenheimer  Napoleon  Wonka  BARHEINAKA
Heck yah 
OMG What effing trash shift is this garbage And whats with the but ugly  no acting skill kid playing Wonka Dahl is spinning in his grave like a whirling dervish because of this junk
Well Paddington 2 is one of the best movies ever made You wouldnt think so until you see it So of this has that style then itll be a winner
"Timothe is daddy  aye       
                                               "
Impatient to discover it 
Oh my god its alan johnson
Damn Timothees playing 2 iconic literary characters in one year Versatility right there
Okay Im listening
Is this the origin story of how he became a psychopath
Another woke film
This got me wanting to look forward to other new movies but seems this is the only one worth watching that people are actually taking time and effort to make 
Is this woke I wont see it unless it woke
2023 is the year that cinema made its triumphant return
This looks good Im interested
Not sure about this Most likely its going to be a flop
Too bad they had to add all those forced woke black characters its like modern Hollywood is so afraid to put a white couple as protagonists they always have to pander and make it seem like the world is made of 50 white and 50 black people lmao
Nah Timothy is not crazy enough to pull off this role This role was meant for Depp only
Everything about this one looks perfect and promising Everything but the lead  They should have cast someone more experienced 
Why are so many people complaining about this and saying Timothee is a miscast This looks amazing
Will be seeing this film Looking forward to it
I was immediately sold when they said it was by the people who made Paddington This will be a triumph
Im glad black people are taking roles that were traditionally played by whites This should stop the riots and murders
Wonka the branding of heroine
Timothee aint it
This Trailer needed more Rowan Atkinson
Mr BEAN the only one for whom we can watch this movie
"First reaction Oh no who needed this
Oh its by the team behind Paddington
And its got Timothy chalamet 
And an awesome cast
And Hugh grant is an oompa lompa 
Ok Im sold"
Wonder what the black girl feels like knowing she only got the part because of the affirmative action diversity hire Hollywood now has to abide by
this looks like a crock of shite
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 1971 is from Paramount Pictures and Wonka 2023 is from Warner Bros Pictures
Gene Wilder remains the only and true Willy Wonka
Johnny depp only my willy
I actually am excited about this one
Well looks diverse enough
I cant explain it but he looks like someone who dressed up as Willy Wonka for Halloween
I need to watch this 
Billy Bonka
"No idea how but the dude is pretty much perfectly capturing Gene Wilders energy here
Also I cant wait for Nestles Wonka Bars to come back Ive been wanting one for YEARS and theres no way they arent coming back"
I saw Director of Paddington and I was sold
"Timothe Chalamet
I am so going to watch this"
Im going to kms
I love how it retains its original style and humour  This is how I was attracted to the first movie
based on these comments this movie is going to be loved by bots did we watch the same thing this is the most flat wonka ive seen no energy felt like i was watching a high school production with a nervous kids first role as wonka wtf hope the studio loves the yes men they hired to tell them this was a good idea
A little spooked that the Wonka theme song  uses the same three starting notes as Jurassic Park at 002 and 151
Love it he keeps playing Johnny depp roles
Omg this looks so garbage anything with blqck people is actually
Perhaps this is a prequel to wonka  Thats the only thing I can think of If its a prequel Then your into somthing Warner
Personally I hope people who dont know of him will fall in love with Neil Hannons songwriting Just a magnificent musician
From the producers of Paddington and the cast of Paddington more like
You know that hoverchoc is gonna end bad or theyre gonna find someone passing gas and coming back down since Wonka hadnt even perfect it in the original
I absolutely love Grants Oompa Loopa Give me more
Lets hope we get pure imagination this time
"1st  I do have a bit of doubts TC may have potential but will definitely have to see No one can replace Gene
2nd  is Rowan Atkinson becoming the British version of Nick Cage appearing in almost every movie now
3rd   Hugh Grant  as an  Oompa  lommpa  I cant ROTF "
Looks for children
The movie looks great But  Willys suspicious and awkward traits are missing I mean Johnny Depp potreyed the character  best  But still excited about this movies
Another one that didnt need to happen looks so cheap and rubbish straight to dvd look reminds of that witches they re did or Matilda both absolutely terrible Il pass
Wish jim carey was in this movie wouldve made it extra memorable with his comedy and energya perfect match for this movie
Im sure the black girl will be the key to all his success 
Absolutely creatively bankrupt
So it wasnt a rumor
I didnt know they were making another Snowpiercer prequel
"WWATCF  52 years later
CATCF  18 years later"
Very cool  I want to watch this because Rowan is in it
i heard they are gonna race swap slugworth in this
When the strains of Pure Imagination began I went from Oh no why to Oh yes please
"some of the castings in this a bizarre what was they thinking and the acting doesnt look all that it comes across as an SNL skit
the floating CGI doesnt look believable and he really isnt a good casting for wonka"
Absolutely not 
I love paddington movies it has Rowan atkinson Im already sold
im here for willy wonka being someones wacky adopted dad
These days its just remake after remake after remake but hey at least this looks good
Why do they have to change everything
Looks awesome
Timothee as Wonka is absolutely insane bc hes absolutely gorgeous and so was Depp and they both played as Wonka
Oh no This has me worried about Tim C in the lead role Its hard not to trust the Paddington director but this trailer just turned all my hopes into worries 
Where is Johnny Depp when you need him
Chalamet just cant be stopped
"         4  10    
                     

      "
Looks OK nothing special
Johnsons gone far
Gene Wilder would be super proud
I was so skeptical when JDepp was taking on the Wonka roll but surprisingly their approach wasnt that cringe Gene Wilder as Wonka is a HARD role to top This has me side eyeing the casting director giving such a role to this guy who in my opinion doesnt have enough range to fill the shoes I may get ate up for that  but lets be for real His supporting casts carry the movies hes appeared in Lets hope they do this some justice
So this one is connected to the Gene Wilder one Cool
This is actually an all star cast I even spotted rowan Atkinson
Ugh
Hes clearly been sold as the new Johny Depp
Whatever happened to kids getting punished for their terrible ways Seems Like Dahl would despise this iteration as well
Mr Bean
AM SO WATCHING THIS I GREW UP WITH THISSSSSS SERIES OF MOVIES EEEEKKKKKKK am full of magician
Bet
The first time ever that Atkinson took a check
Whats wrong with the first one
giving it a chance if the director is behind Paddington perfect films
Im sorry its not the same without Johnny Depp Willy Wonka its his role
Even Mr Mosebeys ancestor couldnt catch a break
Nope
how about we come up with original ideas instead of taking whats already done
Wtf is this
RIP  Gene Wilder
Ah the wholly unnecessary prequel 99
Looks amazing I just need to not compare him with Johnnys version and appreciate this as an individual movie  cant wait for it
They really running out of movie ideas huh
Timothy chalamet as Willy wonka its actually a good casting choice
Oh my god I cant wait
Wonka comes off a bit too American
I completely forgot this was being made lol It reminds me of the movie with Depp in it and I love both the 70s movie and that movie so Im sure Ill love this too
Bad choice of actor playing wonka
Me emociona mucho ver a Timothe como Willy Wonka estoy muy segura que har una espectacular actuacin no puedo esperar para verlo 
Worst movie in alltime
I LOVE THIS
Who up wonking they
I am crying but in happy manner because pure nostalgia has coming my childhood was very imaginable after the Jhonny deep willy wonka movie now again they was coming 
Cg12a
I had my doubts but once I learned Paul King was directing those doubts melted away
Looks absolutely terrible 
Mr Bean and Hugh Grant Im in
WB I promise you can branch out from single word titles for movies Itll be okay
So thats what happens when a Hogwarts letter doesnt reach its destination Wonka making a magic all of his own
Was another one needed again Can we have more than remakesprequelssequels
Hmmm looks intresting excited for sure Waiting to see the conservatives getting triggered there is a black actor in the film saying stop pushing your race agenda like black people do not exsit in the real world IDIOTS
I was out until Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa ALL IN
What the heck atredies became willy wonka
This is the kind of role that Timothe Chalamet is suited to play Why they cast him as the lead in Dune is beyond me
could the giraffe scene be a nod to the Giraffe and the Pelly and Me
Paul Atreides future looks a little goofy here but nothing for him to have been so horrified about
I have goosebumps
I cant even imagine what my day dreaming total would be 3 a day dream a day or will I be charged by the minute
Not sassy and eccentric enough for Wonka but maybe hell grow into it just feels bland
They destroyed my childhood fr
Didnt ask for it but definitely need it
Was that Mr Bean
I gonna put this on the must watch list 
I feel bad because I know Timothee Chalamet is a good actoris anyone else not quite feeling his performance based on the sample of it here Hes definitely trying but Wonka is supposed to be more than just full of wideeyed childlike wonder Hes got an edge a dark side Both previous Wonka movies played up different sides of it but IDK presenting The Greatest Candyman here may bring down the rest of the film a bit Also Hughpa Loompa is a no from me dawg
Will never top Johhny Depp ever
Seems like itll have good special effects but im not seeing Willy Wonkas loony personality in this Hes supposed to be an eccentric lad but this guy just seems to act like an airhead
As a person who was raised on a plethora of great movies including the Charlie and the chocolate factory I am expecting big things from this
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and Rowan Atkinson running around screamingIll give it a shot
God this actor sucks who plays Wonka Terrible in Dune and now this Hollywood is bankrupt on ideas and talent
Never did I expect what is essentially a Willy Wonka panto but here we are
 
Im really surprised how unoffended by this I actually am this really doesnt seem to tread on any preconceived notions I had about the character
a movie i never knew i wanted or needed im watching this because it looks like pure fun and imagination come to life
Great concept but the acting looks subpar
Wow how magical he seems like a natural for this role AND Hugh grant  thats an unassuming casting that seems to work
This doesnt look very good
Ah yes exactly what the world needed Willy wonkas backstory starring one of the most wooden actors ever Just for good measure lets turn him into the onceler
The cinematic version of pure imagination is a nice touch
I miss Johny Depp 
Goofy ahh Willy wonka
hes gonna slay so hard i fear
And the funny part I just watched the ad before this and after lol
OK sticking Colours where they SHOULDNT be AGAIN IT WILL BOMB
I need to see this
This is soo good
Rowan shouldve been cast as Wonka
Bot comments
Nope This looks awful Chalamet doesnt sell crazyendearing well
This looks magical I felt so fuzzy and warm watching it
Yet another followup remake Hollywood how shocking
Its breaking bad with chocolate for kids
His acting in this looks terrible and a bit cringe lol
No one can match johnny depp
"Bro STG this movie got announced nearly 5 years ago back in early 2019 
This Writers Strike is just REALLY delaying everything huh"
I thought BARBIE was going to be the worst movie of 2023 but now they have some real competition This looks horrendously bad not to mention boring af Violet and Veruca and Augustus are rolling over in their graves
We now have a full Wonkaverse 1 Wonka 2 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 3 Snowpiercer
Johnny Depps Son playing him 17 years later 
As a big Willy Wonka fan I hope this doesnt fall flat
This is great cant wait to watch and how lucking i found it when I was posted 3 hours later lol
I feel like its a prequel to the Charlie And The Chocolate Factory movie but it gives Greatest Showman vibes and it has Timotee frikin Chalamet in it 
Good trailer man Had zero interest in seeing this from the press releases etc but I may actually give it a watch Trailer guys did their job
102 The Legend 
Damn Im just not feeling chalamet as wonka 
Mr bean
I have relatively little faith in movies but the casting in this is perfect Looks great
Sir you said Ive spent the past 7 years traveling the world perfecting my craft so you started when you were 9
doesnt look good to me
Absolutely love it
This movie is fantastic and magical too
This movie is gonna fail as hard as Dial of Destiny
Everything but 2 things makes me really like what I see about this movie so far One of the two is the Oompa Loompa It just makes me go Why The other is a major one considering the character is who the movie is about is Timothys Wonka I really think he doesnt fit as Wonka at all or at least from this trailer
This just looks like an amazing time Looking forward to it
""
This is definitely better then Depp Wonka May give this one a go
thats how its done Disney
Damn I was really hoping this was gonna be a dark movie not a silly sing along Show us how Wonka gets the workers pulled up to an island and just took some people that dont look like him and made them work
Lame
Wonka is Awesome 
s
NOONE NEEDS ANOTHER GOD DAMNED WILLY WONKA MOVIE WTF
If this is as nice as the trailer Im taking all the grandkids to see it
This kind of character only suitable for Johnny depp
No one asked for this
    
Beutifull 
my jaw dropped when i saw timothee chalamet playing as wonko
Hmmmm Naaahhhh
This looks good
So is this gonna be a reboot or the story set years before the golden ticket stuff
its wonky time
im here for sally hawkins
This looks like dumb fun Definitely on my watch list
From a movie teaching kids to behave to a movie goofy and fun
Why Just why
I saw Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grantthats enough for me to see this
Rowan Atkinsons in this movie
Timothee chalarmet 
I feel like bots are trying to promote this  sorry you wont beat the old the original
I cant wait for this to come out and Im so glad they followed the original movie theme 
Anyone notice timothees acting is quite off
who up wonkin they willy right now
This guy who plays wonka is trash Being held up by the cast around him Gene Wilder would be turning in his grave
Serious question Many of the comments posted for this trailer today are duplicate copypasted comments from different accounts The comment the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has was been posted by at least 6 different users within the first 30 minutes of the trailer being posted Are these WB accounts AI Paid endorsers Some of these accounts are many years old so not new fake accounts
I was a bit unsure about this but now I cant wait
Wowww Oompaa Loompa are here again 
Timothy doesnt have the crazy look that really gives Wonka his edge as a character  Maybe he wants to still look cool even in what should be a silly and lighthearted role such as this one
People are gonna write this off only because its not the original
"Gives the same vibes as The return of Mary Poppins
Love it"
Movie titles try not to just use the last name challenge DIFFICULTY IMPOSSIBLE
I never knew that i needed to se something where i was a bit creeped out and entertained at the same time
No no no please no why remakes again and again no no no
"Im not feeling this Willy and I not this title either The title should be Willy Wonka not Wonka I mean nobody calls The Rock Rock
But other than that most everything else looks great"
MR BEAN 
MY ONE TRUE LOVE TIMOTHEE CHALAMET
If KeeganMichael Key is gonna be in it then its gonna be good 
"hmmmmm no 
came here bc of curiosity but no dont like Timothee 
im gonna stay with Johnny version  not the same ik"
The title of this movie is way too close to wanka
So Timothee Chalamet is going to reprise his Paul Atreides role in Dune Part 2 in November and then a month later we will see him as Willy Wonka in this movie  Looks like this holiday season is Chalamet all the way
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is something I didnt know I needed in my life
Why do they have to keep remaking this movie The original wont be replaced Who is watching these
This looks extremely dumb Warner Bros just gives us a sequel to the Iron Giant already
""
Not sure if Wonka the chocolate factory movie or Wonka the shrooms chocolate bar factory movie
the tribute to his mom part is all I needed to melt
There should NOT be Americans in this movie just Brits And before someone brings up Johnny depp yes I know Lol
Olivia Colman 
Wow  A black female costar a black mayor and the ONLY mention of the word woke is the one I just made  I think this marks the first time Im proud of a YouTube comments page
I honestly have no idea what I would make of this trailer were I not aware of the Charlie and the Chocolate Factory context It certainly looks like a fun whimsical welldesigned childrens film with a great sense of worldbuilding and fantasy But I have no idea what Id make of the premise and whether Id think it felt contrived or forced Oh well Ill definitely check it out anyway
Im so excited
Well doesnt this scream agenda wokeness diversity and inclusion and my god not only gender swap but race swapping Charlie as well  This is a desecration of everything that  Roald Dahl created and you just took a  all over it
I am actually excited to watch this
What a joke of a film
Why remake a classic Because they needed to go woke
Thank you for not making Willy a girl I hope he remains a man Sigh Times
Oh great another fairytale You know actually having a dream is not at all what is presented in movies Because fantasy is everything around us
Woke 
Has some Pan 2015 vibes
"The original Wonka is legit a masterpiece  Untouchable  And here we are nowyears laterwith a SECOND reboot   sigh

That being said i wish this film and its fans no ill will   I do hope it finds new ground with the subject and opens a whole new generation to the world o wonka   snozzberries"
Hollywood has truly lost original ideas Thank goodness for Christopher Nolan Like for Oppenheimer
ive always wanted a prequel for wonka and this is looking like it can live up to it  so excited
"Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompas
And Rotwan Atkinson in one movie Take my money Im all in"
Was shocked that Wesley Snipes wasnt cast as Wonka
Depp would have been better 
TRASH
This is not how I imagined Willy Wonka becoming a thing just trying to outsmart a chocolate cartel by bypassing some need a shop to sell chocolate law by making an oompa loompa free labor shop somewhere else
Oh this looks so cute
I have never like this kid sorry
Remember seeing the original as a little kid when it first came out in theaters Seen it countless times since  I begrudgingly ended up enjoying Tim Burtons version particularly Danny Elfmans music  This one also looks promising  Should do well I think
this blew me out of the water im stoked
This looks so amazing and so many british actors This is gonna be good
LMAOOO a CGI Oompa Loompa Looks alright no one can top Gene Wilders performance tho
Was this really necessary
So is this Charlie from the original movie
Rubbish actor
Must watch
Bring back Henry Cavill
Apologize to the Johnny Depp film now
This looksmuch better than I was expecting
This has a completely different vibe than the other movies
Huhh
Solo espero que la peli se sienta igual de magica y creatuva que el trailer si no es as me tiro d eun barranco
He seems to be embodying Gene Wilders version of Willy Wonka and Im all for that
Bring back Henry Cavill
102 and 141  is that Rowan Atkinson Honestly would watch just for him lol
Bro forgot to age
Oppenheimer Napoleon now Wonka If theres any proof that cinema has one more chance at survival its this
I wanna wanna say enough with the origin stories noone asked for but this looks kind of fun in all the right ways
Didnt they already remake this movie
Wow this looks really bad
Praise the LORD for creating cocoa trees
Babe wake up a new tumblr sexyman just dropped
I love the little nods to the original movie in the music Pure Imagination
I did not expect Hugh Grant
Bring back Henry Cavill
Ugh Another movie that didnt need to be made Folks the reason that the original is so loved is because of one thing Gene Wilder But hes gone and nothing you do will match the success of the original So speaking of original try to be more of it
This looks very promising Very excited to see it when it comes out
This looks so bland and insipid
Beat a dead horse
Johnson
""
that kid cant act  and he surely cannot act goofy and eccentric   hes outta his league here
After seeing Rowan Atkinson this movie is on my watch list
How on Earth did someone get Hugh Grant to agree to being a OompaLoompa
The chocolate must flow
Inclusion ruin everything
WOW the writers strike strikes again
Well Sally Halkings and Hugh Grant  thats what I call Paddington vibes D  sadly no Paddington 3 yet 
Bring back Henry Cavill
nope nope nope and NOPE who asked for this there is only one Wonka and that is Gene Wilder
Boring
Im not sure quite how I feel about this but Rowan Atkinson shouting Monty Pythons Run away line and all the nods to the Gene Wilder version rose an eyebrow or two Hollywood has been such a dismal failure this year it would be nice to have at least one decent film in the lot
This looks so fun I cant wait
Its Johnson from the Peep Show
chalamet has maybe 3 facial expressions
We need Johnny Depp
This honestly looks charming
i have nothing against Timothee but i feel like this is a miscast
Its not a Disney moviei see
Timothee fans 
Oh dear
its been long since we saw willy wonka Welcome back
Every one is saying this looks amazing and I feel the opposite Im actually hoping that Im the one who is wrong
"HmI dont know On one hand Im SO glad were not rehashing the same old scenes and parts like beforebut on the other

For methe best aspect of Wonka WAS his mystique and not knowing whether what we were told was real or not It might just be mebut I never particularly bothered to find out how his factory came to bewhere he found the Oompa Loompas etc Its a big part of why the 70s movie worked so well for meto Dahls chagrin Wonka in my opinionseemed SO much more than human It hasnt escaped my attention the irony of CHARLIE and the Chocolate Factory being the name of the original workcentering on a childs growthdevelopment and facing reality now serves as inspo only for Wonka Just like how Oompa Loompas served Willy himself  "
I cant put my finger on it but this doesnt look good Just doesnt feel like Willy Wonka to me
Do not make old movies 21st century good
The movie no one asked for
Its giving me Fantastic BeastsCatsBig Fish but not in a good way
that was a good movie glad i watched the whole thing now
Laquisha and The Chocolate Factory feat WokeKa No thanks
They really do be running out of movie ideas dont they 
im on the fence timothy wasnt brining the energy
It feels like he lacks Willys weirdness He looks too ambitious and focused
This is giving a 90s vibe i like it you got my money 
This movie seems so good I am really looking forward to watch it especially with timothe as willy wonka I am not gonna miss that 
What next Humpty
Willy Wonka is actually selling his weird stuff and not just his chocolate bars Respect to WB for going in a new direction rather than just the I need a replacement for my chocolate factory also I enjoyed the Harry Potter vibe from the setting Wonka may not have been magical but his candy sure seems to be
FINALLYYYY  IM EXCITED FOR THUS MOVIE 
Every good thing in this world is started with a dream dam
Timmy cant act
Just 3768 hours to wait Well kinda
This reminds me of a different movie but idk what it is but atst i kinda wish it felt more like the past wonka movies
Oh nooooo not Chalamet
Bruh
Incoming flop
MR BEANNNNN
Another WB movie flop 
Ok so this isnt some dark reboot its a straight up prequel  That is a bold choice  Kids gonna have to really get angrycrazy to match Wilders quiet intensity as Wonka though
Why
Who the f greenlights this garbage
There is only one Willie Wonka movie this isnt it
wow that cast
 oh wow this actually looks kinda cute
Timothee AND Mat Baynton Were so in for a treat
i wanted wonka to be murderer and go on a killing spree but i guess this will be fine
This is by far the most exciting movie other than the Barbie movie Im excited to see
Thought this was going to be a reboot but its an origin story which im all up for Hopefully they can add a cameo of Johnny Depp
Ooompa loompa HUGH GRANT HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA
"omg i got goosebumps  im so excited for this movie cant wait 
perfect for Christmas"
Well this looks terrible congrats
Made by the producers of Harry Potter any movie with elements of that kind of magic is right up my alley Now I wouldnt mind a prequel to Mary Poppins to know where she comes from and how she got her magic
"     
          "
I see Jeremy Clarkson can finally fit in a Mini Cooper classic
Besides Mr Bean movie seems to be trash DOA
""
Why
in rus the WONKA logo looks like  which in eng is butt how not to laugh now
Its like a fairytale but with a magician
What is this trailers music very similar to the one piece live action trailers music xD
Oh No Im not going to be the spoiler and tell you this film is going to end TRAGICALLY with that little girl  Something will happen to her in the end She will get Cancer or I dunno get food poisoned
Amazing man woolie wonka was such amaazing 
actor not good enough to play wonka
If I see Mr Bean I m watching it
"Im something of a candy maker myself

 Harry Osborne"
Wow
Oh no they snapped we makin it out the chocolate factory with this one 
13M in just 2hrs Damn yall really excited huh
It was a drink not chocolate that made Charlie and his Grandad fly in the book and the original film
Is that the 2nd part of CHARLIE  THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY 
"Appalled at the fact that studios would make remakes of classics just for the sake of diversity 
Coming up with new ideas No Just make remakes and change genders and colours"
"they have the og music in the mix

this is gene wilders wonka holy"
This looks pretty good  Im pleasantly surprised that it doesnt look like a victim of Hollywood wokeness disease
They had me on the director of Paddington
Paulput the spice down Youve had enough
only chocolate no chocolate color girl
Terrible portrayal of Willy wonka just insulting to the character They messed up not casting Jeremy Allen White
Timothee as Willy Wonka when he was younger has to be such a perfect choice I grew up with Johnny Depps and my mom grew up with Gene Wilders I hope this generation will have the same love for Willy Wonka as I did when I was a kid 
Not another remake
This is really bad
God why He has 0 charisma ew His acting feels extremely forced
"WW Woodrow Wilson Willy Wonka 
Minerals"
"After seeing this trailer I can now surely believe how much of a perfect and intriguing depps willy wonka was Every detail of his wonkas character was captivating memorable and unique Timothees wonka is so simple only the clothing have been done good but otherwise overall timothees character development is not looking that cool or majestic They didnt even added or subtracted in his facial features by adding new colour tones to face which could have made him look different in character whereas
However Johnny Depps Willy Wonka had every sort of subtle unique and eccentric layers to his wonka even the face tone in on his wonka face was so fascinating that even till to this day I cant imagine anyone else playing wonka Im a bit skeptical about this films creation of wonka Timothee is not even giving half of the expression Depp gave in his version of the movie I feel that this film is not that much captivating but if it manages to work on box office than it would be due to only one reason and that is because of beautiful cinematography"
This film is make a very best special magical musical tastiest delicious sweet as a candy and Chocolate could ever eat Because the whole Wonka Candy and Chocolate will make us hunger and tasted sweet candy and chocolate for all of us in the whole world
Mr Bean in the house
I dont feel that Timothe Chalamet was the right actor for this character he cant conjure up that specific kind of energy and charisma that is Willy Wonka and characters of that sort Its not that TC is a bad actor hes just not right for this particular role Everything else looks great though Its sad when they put actors in roles just because they are trending at the moment instead of finding the right actor for the character
Im just here for Rowan Atkinson
Looks woke
Magical colorful and full of imagination qualities lacking in the Tim Burtons version cant wait
The last Willy Wonka film I seen was with Johnny Deep or maybe this movie is a prequel to the original Willy Wonka movie
Now this I am looking forward to
HUGH GRANTALOOMPA
Kya Woke Bakwaas hai
Anyone getting Oz the great and powerful vibes or is it just me
Good chocolate Needs more spice though
MR CARSON  this looks delightful
oo seems interesting I am going to see it
This guy cant compete with Depps Wonka in the slightest Does Hollywood not have more young actors but this guy and Tom Holland Like come on This is pathetic
Why
I had no interest in this as much as I love Timothee Chalomet but when I saw its the same director as Paddington I suddenly became very very intrigued
Saw MrBeanGUYS HES ALIVEEE
"Me before watching trailer 
Me after watching trailer "
I couldnt be more excited This looks excellent
"After SUDDEN destruction I doubt there will be a movie house standing by Christmas that will actually be used to show this or any other movie BE YE WARNED REPENT NOW 
SEEK JESUS NOW WHILE HE MAY STILL BE FOUND 
"
Who asked for this
I cant wait to watch this on HBOmax
Trash
Is this a prequel to the original movie or the Johnny Depp version
Am I the only person who wants Jonny Depp as Wonka
I have a good feeling about this one
103 mr BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAAAAAAAAAAN
i can firmly add this movie to my must watch for Christmas movie list XD
I would love a post credit scene where we see Grandpa Joe getting a job with Wonka
This makes me so excited and emotional because I love MR Wonka Timothy is going to be excellent 
I wish Johnny Depp would have a cameo on this
Me randomly flips to that it has to be a kid scene from family guy
 yeah I think I might just have to watch it
       
Mid Calling it now
Theres ROWAN ATKINSON And yes Im screaming
Theres no way I wont not watch this
DOWNFALL
Im surprised wonka himself isnt played by a black actor
Suprised they didnt race swap willy wonka
Oh my gosh it looks wonderful
""
So these are the roles you get when youre jewish and bang Armie Hammer as a teenager
""
the way watching this trailer instantly lifted my mooooood
Hope to see Wonkas dentist father in this too 
just seeing Rowan Atkinson even when doing nothing makes me laugh already
A goofy white guy who gets all his ideas from a woman of color in the backgroundmulticultural castall the bad guys are white guys  I can see where this is going  Sorry WB but I will gladly bend over and YOU can smell MY chocolate factory 
Looks cool but please stop showing so much of youre movie in the trailer Its so irritating
Wonkaaaaaaaa
they made willy a whimsical twink 
Flop
Time do uncover the past of how Willy Wonka got rich under the exploitation of cheap Oompa Loompa labor HYPE
the prequel of the 70s version they really did their homework
I miss Jhonny Depp as Willy Wonka 
"Yay Statistically perfect multicultural casting
AND Chalamet proving to be less and less dynamic as time goes on
Woooooo"
Kylie Jenner 
Unfortunately it seems like theyre trying to emulate the original movie This is a problem because its impossible to emulate The Gene Wilder Wonka is such a unique performance with so much of Wilder in it that the Wilderesque moments in the trailer as talented as Chalamet is seems like hes trying to do an impression rather than play a character They shouldve gone back to the source and readapted
That random little black girl went on to be his COO LOL 
"Not sure how I feel about them morphing a trickster figure into a heroic underdog The inclusion of a child as a sidekick seems to pull away from the crux of his character arc in the original Wonka is a lone genius who only comes to appreciate and allow space for a protegee at the end of his career after putting both himself and the possible replacments through a tricky lil crucible

This all feels very very kiddified for a story that was already approachable for kids"
"Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is not some thing I had on my 2023 Bingo card But Ill take it 

Ill see it for him and Rowan Atkinson"
Imagine getting fined for daydreaming 
"Too late Ive started dancing now 

Once weve started we cannot stop "
Paul took too much spice and this is what he saw in his head
Who up wonking their willy rn
"There are no such laws that prohibit daydreaming irl thats got to be the most unrealistic law Ive ever heard of in my in entire life I mean opening up a basic Chocolate Stand Cookie Stand or Lemonade Stand without permits are one thing but a fictional law in the Wonkaverse where Daydreaming is prohibited Thats gotta be the most unrealistic law to ever be made up isnt it 039 I mean what real life country in their common sensible mind would be this bonkers to make up such an absurdist law that nonsensically prohibits ones personal moment to daydream whatever he she or they are thinking about anyway

I honestly cant wait to see this Wonka Origin film when it comes out of course although I still dont get who in their right mind would want to lawfully prohibit daydreaming by outlawing it mean isnt usually common sense for a boss to tell their own employed workers in workplaces to stop daydreaming and get back to work or else theyll get fired Sure daydreaming could get anyone in trouble if they happen to be working in a work environment and that they could only daydream when given or taking a break from work but what Popcorn brained whack job in their political mindset prohibits those taken breaks from their jobs unemployed or those whod happen to be homeless folk in the wonkaverse from daydreaming in general 039

I mean theres no such laws in real life countries that would prohibit the unemployed or homeless from daydreaming in general right this Prohibitive idea of outlawing daydreaming is even more absurdly outrageous than the fictional prohibitive laws in the Dystopian Post Apocalyptic PSVITA Title Freedom Planet where a human beings unauthorized existence amnesia be it intentional or unintentional or starting a family etc are all ridiculously considered huge crimes by the Freedom Wars worlds standards I tell ya wonka fans what"
Oh great more Timothee Chalamet  
I have never thought and I never wanted them to make another Charlie and Chocolate Factory movie because the first one was perfect Now I have to see a remake Im not watching that
I like that its not cringe
All I needed were OGstyle oompa loompa songs Make Hugh Grant the Oompa Loompa and now Im fired up
No
So chocolate is basically crack in this universe Explains why he made it with a chemistry set
WAS THAT MATHEW BAYNTON
Ok I VERY much appreciate that this isnt too gritty
If you love chocolate youll love this movie
Oh my god yes please
Is that fing Johnson
Meh I dont think this world needed a reboot Ill wait for reviews since nothing in it made me want to go back and read the books or watch the previous movies
While this looks charming I cant help but feel that Timothee is a bit miscast in this It almost seems like he is doing an impression of the Wonka actors before him rather than embodying the character and making it his own but well see
Hes wonky maybe even a lil willy I betcha
It doesnt look as good as the last one with JD but we will see
Please be good Jonny made this a memory for me
December Wtf 
Definitely taking my daughter to see this
Willy Wonka walking down the streets 
is this gonna be a musical or not i wanna know
se ve muy britanico para willy wonka
Looks like woke garbage Pass
This looks cute
I would definitely take my kid to see this If he was still a kid
So this is all about the young wonka Remind me of the old willy wonka in charlie  the chocolate factory can they meet just like in multi universe
I think theyve finally got it right
"    
    "
I dont care for Timothy Chalemet just something about him I dont trust
Great cast Timothee Chalamet great actorbuuuuut not whom I wouldve chosen to play Willy Wonka Im guessing this is based off the Gene Wilder Wonka and not Johnny Depp Either way Im not seeing Chalamet channel either Well see
Timothy as Willy Wonka is something I never imagined Id see
Hollywood hates Johnny so much they are trying to cover up one of his best movies
 
So again no little people are cast
I feel like he is too young
From the Director of Paddington Im sold those movies are cinematic masterpieces
Why is he whispering so much
Woka 
I hate how they keep making Willy wonka movies
Zero whimsy Hes a great actor but you need a larger than life character to play this role Like a Jim Carrey or a like Jack Black even Wilder set a high bar because he was so unpredictable and charming yet intense This just feels sterile and i feel like ive already seen it He struggles to get seen then wins people over runs the chocolate cartel out of town and then at the end he gets a building and starts talking about making the factory then depending on the success of the movie there will be another one of him building the factory Feels like another Cruella Its a shame this would have been cool Ill still watch it and hope Im wrong 
oh what a surprise they blocked word english from their comments
""
Timothee Chalamet as Wonka looks great Definitely gonna be checking this out
ah forced diversity in 1920s England thatll be a pass get woke go broke
NO
Ugh not another one
Wow lol
 
Oh look a movie nobody asked for being made for the third time in 2 decades I dont care what anyone says Hollywood is not out of ideas they just have the same 10 ideas over and over again I predict it loses 50 million
He doesnt have the charisma he is so terribly flat
I meanthey were dwarveswhy didnt they cast dwarves now as well
More little people out of work due to CGI
Difference of opinion but no this looks bad
No imagination Just remakes
I dont know about mr McStiff but maybe he could use it as a weird humour
Rowan Atkinson 
I was with this and then the Oompa Loompa at the end scared me
Hmmmm Looks good I know Timothy did theater so he might be good in this role Never really seen him in anything else but dramas so Im interested to see how well he will do this genre
i like how they are leaning in to the goofy and the absurdity of willy wonka trying to do this with seriousness would not work as well
No thanks
Looks great 
No thank you
This looks Scrumdiddlyumptious
Justa simple charismatic movie we all needed Rowan Atkinson put a smile on my face
You seem to have forgotten that both charlie and wonka were ENGLISH  Stop being culture vultures
i feel this is gonna be good
Why cant they make anything original anymore
Everything in this movie looks great but why Charmaine He is not the best actor
looks decent hopefully it steers clear of modern woke politics
"Im really interested 
Looks like a faithful prequel from the original made with care"
I think they need to leave this film alone   Weve seen enough of these renditions  What is this Like the 3rd Willy wonka  Hollywood isnt creative anymore Half of every movie coming out now is remakes
So many of the lines he says are so underdelievered they needed someone who has more depth and knows how to handle lines lke genewilder could handle
This looks every bit as whimsical and magical as the original film Im for it
OMG 
Dune in November Wonka in December I know the actor of the year 2023 now
Why
This looks like the very worst thing ever
This movie looks good and a good prequel to the original
"I cannot wait to see how many children Willy Wonka is bringing down to his basement this time
Also it would be foolish of me to think that Wonka is only exploiting one Oompa Loopa"
This is sooo cheesy
If i had a nickel for every time they adapted Charlie and The Chocolate Factory into a film Id have 3 nickels which isnt a lot but its weird that it happened thrice
Hopefully it doesnt flop
Omg Perfect cast Ive been waiting for thissss
No trailer has ever put me off a film so quickly
""
As a pessimist I am actually thinking this is gonna be a fun movie
so excited for thismore than any superhero movie
134 Help isnt he the guy from Horrible Histories 
This feels more like harry potter than Fantastic Beastdamn
Damn Hollywood really is out of ideas  Cant wait to see this movie flop just like every movie thats came out this year
"Timothee as Willy Wonka is fcking whack  
Ill definitely be watching this Looks lit"
Kwisatz Haderach in alternative timeline
Willy Wonka 
 
I am questioning the casting choice of High Grant though It is soodd
I am really sad that its not Johnny Depp you is gonna play Wonka 
More like Wanka
Childhood memories coming back
I didnt think Chalmt would be right for this but he seems to capture the same eccintricity that Johnny Depp had
This looks like garbage
""
Could never imagine in dreams Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas but man this is so loveable
""
Zhopka
oml cannot wait for this movie Burst out laughing at Hugh Grant and Rowan Atkinson  so happy to see Sally Hawkins here too feels like a small homage to Paddington 
Please dont make Willie Wonka woke
It gives  Greatest Showman vibes
Greatbreak the mistery exploit a story Bunch of lazy studiosjust creat smth new already Stop the cameos CASH GRAB MONEY BAIT
Black people didnt even exit in the time of the willy wonka story They always need to insert themselves in to anything
This looks like it would look amazing in 3D hope we get it in 3D
This is gonna be my Joker
It looks like Timothy Chalamet channelling danielthrasher
Wait okay so by the look of the Oompa Loompa at the end is this actually a prequel to the original Willy Wonka movie If it is thats awesome
this is so cringe
They completely reeled me in acknowledging nobody wants to hear the Oompa Loopa song hahahahaha
I have never seen any of the Willy Wonka movies and Im 19 I will definitely check this out and might watch the original films first This looks like itll be a happy and fun musical film
Looks amazing
Timothe Chalamet had my curiosity with Dune now he has my attention with this
Again
"Oh no Another milking of an old franchise thats nostalgic in a painfully obvious attempt to make easy money Cant wait to see how this flops at the box off

From the Director of Paddington

Ill let you cook a little longer"
omggggg it finally happening im soooooooooooooo excited 
Im not sure what it is but Timothee Chalamet just isnt doing it for me as Wonka Also why is there a child with him who is never so much as mentioned in the book or either of the movies
Mr Carson
When he said I am wonking my willie literal chills 
Wonka is only one Johnny Depp 
""
Hes gonna be a great Willie Wanka
Rowan Atkinson And Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa omg 
What happened to Willy
I rarely dislike a movie from the trailer but this looks not so good
LETS GOOOOOO
"Oompa loompa dupidy dawesome

Dwight is now gone which is totally awesome 

Why was he gone he was such a nice guy

No he was not he was a total doushe

Dupidy dup"
140 rowin atkinson hello
Come onstop it already Give is new charachters new stories instead of cameos rip offs Thimothy will be crushed hereDeps version was horrendous already with nth but wide eyes and wierd empty faces this clip shows Timothy doing the same Will there be also some of the message as certain drinker would say 
"I GENERALLY CANT WAIT FOR THIS HYPED ASF The production and prop design look beautiful Love the Roald Dauls works great cast and so excited to see it was by the same director who did Paddington 

This film will be magical"
This looks terrible
Damn Chalamet looks like a mix of Wilder and Depps version of the character
This made my heart feel warm 
""
Oh look another remake 
This movie better be good
I cant wait to watch this on TNT in 10 years when theres nothing else on
why so many dislikes
Im so glad this is not a remake rather the story of how Wonka became Wonka
Hes the calmest Willy wonks Ive ever seen
Come on spend money on smth better we already got perfect Wonka Johny will never be changed by this little shalaman kid whatever
This looks like a documentary Willy Wonka would make This actually looks good
So its mother issues again
Cant Hollywood make original movies anymore
"I saw a glimpse a smudge a crumb of Rowan Atkinsso I will wait with baited trepidation and mute expectation that there is nothing woke and therefore broke in this movie  
Theres still time 
Theres still hope"
Bro he seems nothing compared to the og wonka 
gene wilder nailed it so stop trying
Just another shameless cash grab to milk out as much nostalgia as possible
I hope Johnny Depp make a cameo
Look everyone the included Diversity See No one cares
I dont care
Well Im gonna cry while watching this  LONG LIVE GENE WILDER the man who brought the character of Willy wonks to life
Of course his sidekick is a black girl No story can exist unless we wedge in an important character of color Something tells me her character is the genius that he couldnt do it without and she has the idea or plan that saves the day
Looks really diverse
always the blackwash 
This looks like a great Christmas movie
If Johnny Depp couldnt pull off a better performance that Gene Wilder then Timmy Chardonney doesnt stand a chance
I wonder if this will get dark somehow
I hope they base him on the older movie wonka and not on micheal jackson again
no vou mentir parece ser bom  talvez no seja uma bilheteria astronmica mas parece que vai ser bem legal pra levar os filhos pra Assistir
Not impressed
      how disappointing
NBD just him selling chocolate at the Galera Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan small beginnings I guess
December 
He doesnt have Johnny Depps Michael Jackson swag but im interested in seeing Tims portrayal nonetheless
Ok You have my full attention
Winter movie this looks promising already will be a good watch during winter D
Gorgeous and delectably charming
Already better than Johnny depp version
"The Chocolate Cartel

Damn we about to get people getting drowned in the Hot Chocolate Swamps"
Suddenly every other rando is a CGI expert and an academy award winner  stop complaining seesh
Me see Rowan Atkinson me love it
This looks bad
HAHA  Another remake  HOW STUPID   LOL
""
willy wonka with a chocolate companion that is so funny
Of course they had to go woke and add blacks to the remake
Bad casting
Ehh
Of course the costar is black lol Hollywood cant help themselves with their fake virtue signaling Ill stick with the original 1971 version thank you
NotMyWonka
The Greatest Showman  Mary Poppins  Fantastic Beasts  Miss peregrines home for peculiar children  Dolittle  This movie
"Its not giving 

Edit it actually is omg I will be seated"
I was wishywashy right up until Hugh Grant as an OompaLoompa and now I am so in
who up wonkin they willy rn
This gonna be one the movies of all time for sure
Cant wait to see it I was a kid when Gene Wilders movie came out a grown man proud and happy father when Johnny Depps version came out now Ill be taking my by December 7 year old grandaughter to see this new installment a family classic a story to wonderful not to enjoy it
This dropping during the holiday season is a brilliant choice  cant wait to see the production and the world theyve created
Im excited I loved Willy wonka and the chocolate factory as a kid
WHy
Oof this looks awful The humor isnt right for Willy Wonka Too cynical and selfaware The whimsy also feels cheap Im really hoping this is a case of a trailer making a movie look much worse than it is because I would love to love this movie
I cant wait for twink wonka or Twonka as I like to call him
This looks really bad
Johnny Depp will always be the Willy Wonka in my head though
I am starting to love everything this Chalamet kid is in
Well atleast hes still white
Nope
Ive never wanted to be an ommpa loompa so badly
that black girl does not look like a oompa loompa
i see the guy from horrible histories and Im sold
Atleast Grandpa Joe wont be there
Sad I am allergic to chocolate so I am not qualified to watch this amazing movie
Johnny Depp version still king
I cant wait
This is a MUST
I am so proud of lil timmy tim He is such a nice guy and actor Really enjoying all of his work
I think they have started making movies again 
this is SO the opposite of Dahl as a longtime fan I am besides myself a new generation will believe this corny little movie is what Dahl is all about I am a fan of cute tender movies like Paddington or HP but Dahl is NOT this
no
This looks incredibly lame but of course everyone will watch this unoriginal uninspired movie based on preexisting IP and tell publishers that this is exactly what we want
Johnny depp 
This dude as Wonka is a big no  Like he cant bring the crazy like jhonny Depp
Cant wait for Limmy to review this trailer
It would be nice if the original Charlie was the New Grandpa Joe 
I think Hollywood are just incapable of writing there own stories Everything is just an adaptation This looks sub par
""
Definitely looks like a fun story
Endless trash
Nice of the crowd to give him the space and silence for him to finishinf introducing himself
Idk
looks goofy
"Meh
FROM THE DIRECTOR OF PADDINGTON
Leans forward in seat"
I love it Great trailer Timmy as Willy is just 
The only Wonka I know lives in Scranton Pennsylvania
Its so good to see Daniel Thrasher on the big screen
Finally the origin story weve been waiting for
Man Daniel Thrasher is really moving up in the world
Calah Lane has the perfect everything for a possible Amanda The Adventurer movie At 041 I heard Wooly her sheep partner
Meh
dune part two looks wierd
there better be a post credit scene of charlie in it
Who else wonkin they willie rn 
Needs more black people in every scene Just like the original Pass
All I needs was from the director of Paddington and I was in Those movies were literal perfection
That spice got Paul Atreides dreaming up some crazy stuff
This will bomb 
This a new key and peele episode
This one is for the real Willy wonka from many years ago
guys charlie and the choclate factory was my definitive childhood experience  the book and the movies god know how many times i have watched it  timothee and rowan atkinson  i am glad i am alive to see this  its gonna be great guys
Fun fact in Russian the title Wonka written in italics looks like butt
how annoying to see Timothee he acts in all movies no more actors
""
looks somwhere between that horrendous rdj dolittle movie and the early hbo max original movies going straight to streaming
I have high hopes for this film but Timothe Chalamet was not the right casting choice
He hasnt audition for a movie in years and it kind of shows
Yeah its a no for me Timothys acting isnt good enough for Willy
Ive got a great feeling about this D
it magical
Reading through the comments and loving how everyone on here tried so very desperately to come up with something good to say
This could be even better than Paddington 2 Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is genius casting
Johnny Depp did it best 
Johnny Depp is irreplaceable
Lets be honest the Johnny Depp version sucked
No just no What an awful idea for a movie lol
Oh look Another butchering of a classic for another cheap cash grab No matter what they will never recreate the magic of the original gene wilder performance
I predict a flop
Im just gonna say it I think Im more hyped for the FNAF movie 
Nah
Absolutely no one asked for this
I love it  baby mwah 
Nah Im good
"Wuu Im already too excited Cant wait to see it
Special congratulations to Timothe Chalamet such a great actor "
Oh he reminds me of Gene
Just what Hollywood needs  Another movie filled with bad CGI in EVERY shot
cant believe the poor taste of people in these comments still they probably lapped up the risible Depp drivelling on about candies Seems respect for the creators  legacies gone in this era
"Johnny depp as Willy Wonka 
That visuals and movie are still in mind was the best at my childhood"
Awesome
Gene Wilder is Willy Wonka There will never be another
"I hate every second of this
Paddington was lovely but I dont believe anyone asked for an origin story for Willy Wonka The whole idea is that he was a mystery and that the stories about him may as well have been made up until you get inside the factory and see for yourself"
Who wanted this movie  This character and theme barely made the runtime of one movie  Does WW have some huge fandom
Finally a beautiful and brilliant movie being made again Havent had one of those in a very long time
The moment I saw Rowan Atkinson I liked it
No one wants this
I HATE THE ANTICHRIST
If its half as good as this trailer I am ready
would be better without the sigh things that are there just to be there but Ill watch it anyway 
70 bucks he gives the factory and everything to the black girl side kick
Excited to see this
OMG HUGH GRANT
Why does every damn movie need to have a prequel these days It was bad enough with the first reboot
I dont think it looks very good 
The Roald Dahl Vibe be real 
    
Oh good This fictional fantasy land is following DEI for modern audiences Kinda weird that they gave him a slave girl though
Looks dreadful
Not Matt Lucas 
This looks absolutely horrible but in a fun way Im looking forward to it
""
Yikes this looks bad
Gene Wilder was a bad bad man
This feels like a prequel to the 2005 movie
Timothe Chalamet and the BBC TV allstars
Goofy era of Hollywood continues
without even watching the trailer i can tell that its gonna be a huge failure HUGE FAILURE without mrdepp
Maaaaaaan Willy wonka suppose to be a man not a kid imma pass on this one
So glad its not another remake
Meh
Who up wonking they willy right now  
Wow hes white and the female side kick is a cool character and not annoying andor political Thats crazy
Paul atreides really like chocolate huh
Another one
This could be a horror film
I hopethis gives justice to Gene Wilders version which was a hard act to follow
why
Looks goofy
And I was wondering why he was dating Kylie Jenner 
A wholesome Wonka is a distortion and dilution of the book tho But Ill watch it on a rainy day when I need a comfort watch
This looks gorgeous  I Like gorgeous
havent watched the trailer yet guessing its about willy wonka makin g his chcoolate factory as a businessman
Holdup they got MR FUKN BEAN
Dont let this distract you from the original premise of CtCFWW which kills children makes candy out of them and basically makes people eat other people unknowingly Dahl the creatorwriter was perverse sick subliminal type subversive content for childrens books Keep your kids away from all of his work as long as you can
And this connects to snowpeircer how
OMFG please tell me this is fake This looks absolutely RIDICULOUS why cant they leave the classic movies alone
Paul King is gonna direct this film
106 Is that normal chocolate youre making Wonka
Who up wonkin they willy tonight
Wow another remake
Warner este ao esta sacando puros xitos taquilleros sin DC
Well I wont be seeing that
2023 Christmas about to be lit
Am I the only one who feels like Timothys protrayal isnt cooky enough  
i came for mr bean
Straight to DVD
"Go on Chalamet
 Keep making these amazing roles"
DOA RIP Gene
"Damn man
U guys are like jihadist fighting for a dead course the movie was shot half a century ago
Move on or go rewatch it 
Whining in the comment section wont make this film any less real"
Hes got Wilders eyes  Perfect
""
But remember this Spare those bees Wonka Ya gonna need them one day
""
The Rowan Atkinson run away line gave me huge Blackadder throwbacks 
When they said this Chrismas I thought why so late but before we know it it will already be winter
no
Its coming I see a chocolate spreading across the universe like unquenchable fire A chocolate that waves the Wonka banner in my fathers name
This movie looks so bad
Pass
"Why are they making another movie
The original was the only good one"
ooooooook heyecanlymm ana sayfamda bunu grunce ufak apl bir ok yaadm
Looks like they removed the child murder from the story  I might watch it
The movie we never wanted but the movie we needed
He can always use THE VOICE to order the oompa loompas
I guess Hugh Grant will take any role now even as an Oompa Loompa 
To be honest Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Chocolate 
so much better than seeing him get dumped by a hot blonde guy who ends up marrying a woman instead of him so yeah Ill definetely watch it
so average guy to play wonkak
i swear willy wonka was british acording to the book
brb i just gotta send this trailer to everyone i know
TC is no doubt a great actor but no one can outdo and outcrazy Johnnys Wonka
Rowan 
Rowan Atkinson 
When are they going to stop making remakes in actually start coming up with new film ideas Its like theyre just too lazy these days to make new film franchises that they just have to milk old ones Its just so sad The spirituality in filmmaking has just died off
Its all fine other than Willy wonka seems to speak with an American accent
"An Oompa WhatNow
ALLOW Me To Refresh Your Memory
Ooh I Dont Think I Wanna Hear That
TOO LATE I Stared Dancing Now And ONCE Weve Started We CANT Stop
XD "
No  Just no more 
Looks like this version has definitely been blackwashed  No thanks
I dont know manI want a cameo of Johny depp
OMG OMG OMG I LOVE IT 
Im definitely seeing a movie about the life story of Willy Wonka featuring Mr Bean
Too American theyll just ruin the entire storyline 
okat do i think this is silly I think not I acknowledge the efforts put into this movie I do
Oh great another woke remake Is Holywood and the film industry just a mindless factory rehashing classic and well loved movies into boring woke ghosts of their former selves
One thing that bothers me about these trailers is that theyre always made to look and sound epic  and sometimes it just doesnt fit the vibe of the movie This is a perfect example
"       
    "
Willy Woker
But I will be honest Im a bit disappoint that this looks more like a childrens film than the crazy killer vibes that I got from watching Depps version I hope it manages to recreate that vibe
Oh Carson this is so middle class
"I had no idea I needed this
And now I really wanna see it"
Timothee never pulls a bad performance
Wanka
   
The movie you say youre going to see but never make it to the theater for
I dont believe him
SEATED
Nobody is  missing Johny depp
I cant wait The cast is insane My jaw was on the floor throughout the video Timothee has an extraordinary career going on
it looks sort of good just not sure TC is the right actor for it tbh even though I loved him in Dune
Meh where johnny depp
This looks great Ill be looking forward to seeing this movie
They only did this cause ppl are refusing to have anything to do with WB
Too much of a child for me to believe anything the lil  says This is a joke
Fun Fact Roald Dahl absolutely HATED the Gene Wilder version Studio straightup screwed him on multiple aspects of the film This looking like a prequel to that version I can definitely say he is fuming in his grave
Yes not a disney Im watchin
Awful Dahl will be rolling in his grave
Brilliantly Done Looks like a Family film with Heart  Its Awsome and funny These are the movies the world needs and a Stellar cast and well directed The Paddington movies are joyful and happy so if Wonka is made by the people who made Paddington its going to be a super exciting fun movie for everyone
That had to be the fakest flying Ive ever seen  But Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa OH GAWD YES PLEASE 
""
i dont know i just feel like timothy chalamet isnt crazy enough to be willy wonka hope he can prove me wrong
I am seeing this purely for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loop
Another remake once again how original 
Bruh when are they gonna make a Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator movie
i have a question is this sequel or reboot of Willy Wonka because I watched previous movie many times and johnny depp perfected that character
Would have been nice to see this at comic con 
Looks like Milan that mall
Everything here looks great but Timothee has such a modern American voice which kind of takes me out of the magic Am I the only that feels this way
Not sure what I was expecting I guess I was expecting more of an adventure film An adventure where Wonka goes around to different parts of the world exploring different types of flavors for candy and different creatures and people Feels a bit like a rehash of the original with the similar looking oompas and the flying Oh well not exactly too excited for this
take my soul wonkaa  
ITS WONKIN TIME
"Okay so Sally Hawkins and Hugh Grant in the same movie made by the Paddington Bear movieHarry Potter Producer 
So Does Paddington take place in the same universe Cause that would make Paddington 3 really interesting"
i have chocolate fatigue and im not talking about real chocolate
  
On paper I like the idea of this movie I like the cast and I should be impressed by the production values  But something is feeling off to me  Its not connecting  It all feels very sterile
This looks lame af
Sally Hawkins and Hugh GrantIm in
"They didnt
Edit They did"
Thats not Johnny depp 
Looking forward to the orchestral Pure Imagination
i saw Rowan Atkinson it will be game changer and truly  Fantasy
Dune 2 trailer is really taking some liberties with the source material
Yess great trailer so excited
How disappointing    Why cant they leave well enough alone try a something new quit ruining classics
I have no idea how I feel about this but at least it looks like they had a lot of fun making it
A film that has actual colors I havent seen something like that in years
Final a hot person to play as Willy
Should have made the background music Pure Imagination
Trash
It feels more like Timothee Chalamet putting a fancy costume on than Willy Wonka big no for me
What is that weird accent hes doing There is only ONE Willy Wonka and thats Gene Wilder
I want to like this but largely I want to ask why this was made
This looks really good Ive been waiting for this movie to be released for awhile now
I needed the willy wonka hair tho 
So wait which movies timeline is this in It seemed from most of the info that its a prequel to the Burton movie but it has the Stuard Oompa Loompah design
Finally a glimpse of the movie Ive been waiting for so long
this is a joke has nothing to do with willy wonka
Not my Willy Wonka
For a second I thought they wouldnt have oompa loompas but the ending sold me
Oh come Hollywood cant think of anything original
"Me mmmh dunno 
Sees from the makers of Paddington and Rowan Atkinson And Hugh Grant 
Me  OOMPA LOOMPA I WILL WATCH THIS MULTIPLE TIMES"
107 Is that normal pooing youre doing Mark
Prequels sequels  reboots remakes Hollywood is dead
It looks like Hugh Grant is gonna steal the show
Theres only one Willy Wonka for me Gene Wilder
Wtf is this
We shall wait the 4 months  with baited breathhhhhhhh  Dune comes around the same time  delightful 
"We are out of ideas
Next old yeller is buried in the pet cemetery Or maybe air bud is a new cadet in the police force Lethal bud every dog has its day"
This is something that I didnt know I needed This looks absolutely magical
I will say thisthey absolutely nailed it casting Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa
Did I just saw Rowan Atkinson
Wonka the woke man  
Before Willy Wonka meet Charlie
My only concern is that so much money has been thrown at the cast  I just hope enough was thrown where it matters
208 why does Hugh Grant sound like the narrator from the Stanley parable
I hope Roald Dahl would be please or not guess this would be my next Motion Picture surprise of the year
YES
I really hope This is not a musical
Did they get Greta Thunberg to play Veruca lol
"Me  hmmm I have my doubtsthen
142 Rowan Atkinson
Me OK Sold
"
this actually looks wholesome and like something made for people to genuinely enjoy its unfortunate the dark history behind the original willy wonka story but pretty much every classic has a dark past we ignore
I was excited until I saw Keegan Michael Key
Sounds n acts like danielthrasher
Why
This is really good 
"It has the Director of Paddington and
Producer of Harry Potter and everything about this trailer looks interesting
Im especially curious about that giraffe

Ill have to see this"
Well it got me laughing so its got to be worth something
Wowwwwww
Im giggling like a little kid already  Now quiet up and listen downscratch thatreverse it
Given that we have no idea who this girl is I ask ahead of time how tragic will her death be
""
why is this necessary
After all these years thank you for this
Willy Wonka Arrakis
This is not looking good The acting is really missing something
I wasnt interested in this movie at all until Hugh Grant showed up as an Oompa Loompa  Touch  Ill be there opening night
Willy Wonka meets Newt Scamander I am here for it 
Wow 
Missing Jhonny Depp 
Looks like a great movie Very inclusive too I crave candy now though
I think that us having an origin of Willy Wonka is a great idea
im wondering how Warner Bros can ruin a perfectly good story
looks like a fun origin experience we never got to see
I have no idea whether this will be good or legit awful
"This is a feel good movie
God knows we need one 
After a summer of CGI mess"
This looks terrible
Wheres Gene Wilder
Actually this looks like it slaps
Cant wait to see how he lost his sanity to the point he mutilated children
Garbage
Tims certainly no Gene They seem to have managed a Roald Dahl with barely an English accent
  
ug
So take a classic book and remeberence of a classic 1970s movie and twist it completely Fan fiction at its worst
If youre actually excited about this film you need to get a life
Its tough to imagine other person as willy wonka rather than johny depp
I think this is gonna be a decent movie If the music and acting is good its going to be great The acting looks good but well have to see about the music
Wonder how woke chocolate is
SarumanCount DookuDr Wonka would have been proud
Absolutely not
I think they should call it Willy Woka
This looks soooo much better than that overthetop monstrosity created by Tim Burton
Who all  Roald Dahl books
Should have had Mr Beast as one of the villains with Feastables XD
Oh my god Good luck Your going to need all the luck in the world This will be worse movie of the year
A trailer with pure imagination I love it Cant wait to see it
Timothe Chalamet will play a space overlord in dune part 2 and a candy overlord in wonka
Omg another film that shows this diversity by inserting black actors into the film in order to show that they are a society with racial differences and blah blah  even though the truth is something else And yes I know that these events and the story are fictional but the concept of racially different characters shows a society that is accepting and full of differences and coexistence and this is very ridiculous and doesnt work when it comes to these types of movies Oh WoW a European society in the 19th century where White black asian are coexist and live harmony 
 
Looks potentially better than the Tim Burton movie
Woke Wonka
This feels like a magical dream of a child that should never end The trailer just introduced me to Wonka who is enthusiastic funloving knows his art and the best thing knows a lot about chocolate  Yummfiy me with this delicious journey of Wonka can not wait for the full movie to be released
And every bad thing started with a nightmare and I have nightmares all night long and all day long
CANT WAITT
this awesome can we have a Wonka 2 already hahahaha
Im a fairly cynical person when it comes to reboots etc but this actually has a really fun sincere festive vibe Seems like it will be a good time
"A woke Charlie and the chocolate factory is just what the world needs right now
Thanks Warner"
I hope there are songs in the movie
This looks fantastic I know it doesnt open til Christmas but I would like a golden ticket now
It looks fun
Itd be dope if Johnny made a guest appearance
no daydreaming got to me 
COME UP WITH SOMETHING NEW  Dont you have ANY creative people on your staff
"They even used a lyric from the theatre musical 

salute"
Willy Wanka
This looks so cute funny endearing sweet pun not intended and so much more and we have Timothe Chalamet as lead and is that Mr Bean This feels like an honest intent to honor the source material instead of making a prequelsequelremake just because nostalgia is easy
041 Me when I finally get a girlfriend
The wonka trailer looks great I am definitely going to watch it when it comes out
The man the myth the legend Rowan Atkinson has returned
YES WE FINALLY GET HIS BACKSTORY
Well were out of ideas
Boy Pauls been hitting the spice hard
its giving happy kaz brekker lmfao
Is it a prequel to Tim Burtons charley and the chocolate  factory  or original version
"This doesnt just look interesting it looks fabulous We need more films in the same vein as Wonka
I will probably watch this one on the big screen"
YES I LOVE IT AND ITS MY CHILD HOOD MOVIE
Literally clicked on this so fast it was satisfyingly unexpected
Am I the only one who thinks that Timothe Chalamet looks like Daniel Thrasher
No thanks  This looks unbelievably bad  Id rather watch the Johnny Depp one over this abomination and thats saying something
Craving chocolate after watching this 
How many times said chocolate in this movie
I dont really care about this movie but I did not expect to see Mathew Baynton
Roald Dahl would absolutelly hate this even for his grave
They should have casted MrBeast as Willy Wonka
This actually looks quite charming
no depp seems like amber won after all
I loved the part of this movie where Johnson makes an indecent proposal
So does this take away acting opportunities away from little people
Love the tagline
Timothee Chalamet as a wacky goofy magical character SIGN ME TF UP
Only because the titles mention Paddington
I will watch this only for Mr Bean
Why is this movie
Scratch that  reverse itbit of a nod to Gene Wilder maybe
It was a very good two minute movie
Meh movie
I dont knowI cant be the only one hoping that this Wonka will be similar to Johnny Depps Wonka That Wonka was deliciously devious
I mean props to everyone involve who really tried but this uhdoesnt look great
Not a fan of chalamet being wonka
I HOPE THIS MOVIE  ON NEFLEX BEACASE THIS GONNA BE  AMSING
You guys are out of ideas and its so apparent this movie will flop
This is wonderful I wonder what Roald Dahl would think of this if he were alive to see it
""
this looks epic
No one can match johnny deep as willy wonka
Im bout to wonka my willy
Oompa Loompas Can talk properly without singing I never thought I needed to know that
Dont need to see it but it looks cute and hope others enjoy it Looks to have similar charms at Paddington and has a great cast
yo so when does wonka commit genocide against and enslave Loompaland so hyped for that scene
Hmmm looks good
Waiting for WONKAS Another CHOCOLATE FACTORY 
""
Ollie Wonka I have missed you so much Glad youre back 3
no sky beam  damnn
I will be seated 
i was rolling my eyes through this entire traileruntil i saw hugh grantand now i have to see the movie
They played the flute jingle from the 1970s version of Willy wonka  Now thats attention to detail
Yeah this looks incredible
Like who they casted as wonka
Timothee is a Bad castseems forcednot natural
i am optimistic of this film striking a fine balance of being antiprotectionist without being antilabor
Timothee chalamet is trying too hard
OOMPA LOOMPA
Oscar on the way
Finally something original
Oh this one is special
would be awesome if Johnny Depp played this role
" 
"
No
Bring back Johnny Depp
"Michael scott  There is no movie called Willy Wonka  
Dwight  Well there is "
Noooooooo
Atleast we can watch  what we wanted to 
Another childhood moviebutchered
NOT ROWAN ATKINSON AAAAAAA IM CRYINGGGGGGG
I dont think people get that this is a prequel It looks good but I have a bad feeling that theyre going to use a ton of CGI but atleast it doesnt look as bad as Tim Burtons version
Might just be me but it feels somewhat forced hopefully it feels more natural as the movie progresses specifically the nutty part to me felt as such lol
"W  W 
Everything reminds me of breaking bad"
Im actually shocked that Willy Wonka is not black
Did anyone remember Willy Wonkas whistle to the Oompa Loompas at the end
This just put a smile on my face
Yes Yes YES
I hope its just a fun movie with out some kind of social justice message attached Also hoping to not see some outrage over Hugh Grant stealing movie roles from a little persons
I just happy to see Mr Rowan Atkinson lmao
why december dats way too long
Johnny depp one is better
Damn i still cant move on from JD wonka 
I admit Im a little skeptical about this prequel film Nevertheless seeing Willy Wonka say his famous Scratch that reverse it line and the introduction of the Oompa Loompas and their whistle theme has given me a sense of nostalgia Perhaps this film will actually surprise me
I didnt catch half of the things they were saying because I was chuckling and grinning the whole time It looks lovely
This looks so good I cannot wait 
Am i the only one who doesnt get this chin face kid 
Im surprised they didnt swap Wonka out with Jada Pinkett Smith or maybe Oprah better yet Woopie Goldturd
This feels so grandiose and fun
another movie ruined by this twink
I mean its not like the original but it looks pretty good i will definitely watch it
Definite Fantastic Beasts vibes coming from this
Rowan Atkinson 
This actually looks really really good
ITS HERE
Not sure  I like the actor but Johnny had it much uniquely and far more Special  Some times its just not a good idea to re Act on a legendary act
well thats a yup 
I always got the johnny depps vibe from him and now this
I think Chalamet is a great actor but I just see an actor doing actor stuff and not Wonka  
I thought that Willy Wonka was played by danielthrasher for a sec 
WHY WHY WHY do they keep doing repeats of these movies    Its very rare that the original can be outdone    Look at the mess with all the Predator sequels
Bad casting
WE HAVE 2 MOVIES ALREADY
i cant wait  ima react 2 this movie
my timmy
why do they use this music
So basically Willy Wonka is a genius scientist who could have been anything he wanted but decided to make all of his inventions chocolatebased Great Which characters backstory are they gonna ruin next
This looks SO fun
Ye kya likha hai news me ki Ab ghodo ki race me gadhe nhi daudenge
Cautiously Optimistic
mr beannnnnnn
Why do I feel that this movie is going to have so many memes come from it
Looks good but nothing will beat the 1971 version
NO
I cant picture Timothy as a crazy person He seems like he is trying so hard to be Wonka but Im not buying it However he does have to follow up after Johnny Depp which would be hard to do He should have let Timmy Tim loose again
Not scary enough  I was hoping he was gonna be creepy
and not a single mexican around
Nah its not even close to johny depps version
Another one
Could do without the half assed and shoehorned in Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory references
"I wanna watch it just cos I like chocolate lol 

But then again I also like the Wonka films lol"
didnt realize willy wonka was 12
Are there any other young actors than Chalamet So tired of seeing him everywhere
     
Willy Wonka keeps getting younger everytime they make a new movie He has the Spiderman curse
Rather than Timothy imagine had they brought back Freddie Highmore as the lead
Mr bean
Why oh why do we need another version of this film Who signs off on these What an absolute waste of money
ALL THE FIRST COMMENTS ARE BOTS They even copypastes similar comments exactly in some cases lol
Willy wonka wont feel the same without Johnny Depp
Oh non a va tre une  woke
OMG
Hugh Grant was a truly inspired choice
Do we really need this movie
For me i think its not gonna be great like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
oompa loompas have always been weird side characters for me but they sure are funny once weve started we cant stop
thats not willy wonka
WERE SO BACK
Timotee is just not likeable as an actor Hes a pretty boy like tom cruise with none of the charisma This will flop
"His agent really said hey Boi your a big star RN lets make you Wonka for no reason
Please leave Gene Wilders Wonka alone already  and give us new film ideas theres a writers strike I bet there are hundreds of homeless in Hollywood with great stories they are trying to sell and they think we need another Wonka Smh"
Nah Shamalamadingdong is such an overrated actor This movie will get a 40 metascore
Is that the prequel to the movie that came out several years ago
Imagine MrBeast being Willy Wonka
Wasnt that Loompas from another land and they were being hunted
This looks cute Im excited 
Rowan Atkinson 
Bloody Wonka Brother of Coomer
Whys he american and whys he Timothee 
046 Strong af Gene Wilder vibes
i think itd be really cool if this movie harkens back to the source material like maybe some of wonkas naysayers are named madame salt or mr beauregarde or something
"very good 

"
I just reading the book again and this pops up
"this is such a fresh take on this story
something we never imagined but deep down always wanted
cant wait to watch"
"DONT BE WOKE DONT BE WOKE DONT BE WOKE
050 welp i hope this flops harder than The Little SwapMaid"
Who up wonking they willies
Well this is unexpecting
Wonka should be Ezra Miller
Its great to see how well Johnny Depp has laid a foundation of a character so well that actors today try to immitate it
Then he became a murderer 
Ooooo so its a prequel to the Gene Wilder version Love it
"Johnny Depp is in the desert clad in leather head to toe wearing a Central Park carriage driver cap and 6 lbs of guy liner  playing power chords badly on a Les Paul as the camera rolls The big reveal ManStank Paris for the gentleman not afraid to raaaawk  

How many more cologne commercials we shooting today  

Ahem mr depp I think you should see this  Views the new Wonka trailer and goes full Pete Townsend on his axe and amp  WTF Didnt they know Im available Is it too late We can reschedule those Applebees commercials and the jungle cologne ad Is his leather more than a bit ripe   

Ripe is charitable were weeks past ripe here spray this on it And here more eyeliner will make you feel better"
meh
Oh no I dont feel hes as charming as hes acting to be Yuck
i can already tell im really going to hate this 
Finally a good looking remake of a classic
Idk if I wanna see this or not
But Johnny Depps will wonka is irreplaceable
Im gonna watch this just for mr bean
This already looks good I love the fact that there is another twist on wonkas story and origin As seen in the credits of the people working on this film it says there director of paddington and the producer of Harry Potter are working on this so Im expecting big things from them since those films are loved by many
sucks I wish there is a vote down option
Hugh Grant  as the Oompa Loompas laugh me XD
I was critical of Timmy at first but the message really brings a tear to my eye We really do need to all remember how to dream again and whats at stake when we dont
I thought Village Roadshow was done making movies with Warner after Village Roadshow sued WB for The Matrix 4 being a box office bomb but I guess I was wrong
BOY I CANT WAIT TO SEE THIS REMAKE IM SURE ITLL BE DIFFERENT FROM ALL OTHER REMAKES ITLL HAVE A NEW SPIN I BET
this is insane
""
""
So Willy Wonka meets Harry Potter then
Wait an origin story of Wonka I might actually really be interested and rethinking of Wonka now
I hate it
Ugh when will the remakes END
I was like nahhhh but now Im like yeah Ill watch 
Howd he get off that sand planet
nice i like it picasso
They should have stopped after the first one
sucks and bad casting
Wait what the mom from the Charlie and chocolate factory 2008 
This movie feels unnecessary Its all there in the original This modified version is bleh bleh bleh
This actually looks incredible 
DIVERSITY IS OUR GREATEST STRENGTH
"The trailer ends at 115
Thank you"
Oh for fck sake can we PLEASE quit it with the reboots
"Who all misses Johnny Depp

"
Paul Atreides starts a chocolate factory after successfully taking back Arrakis from the Harkonnens control with knowledge of the spices secrets
I am so ready this movie Timothee is gonna give this role his all and hes gonna make many Charlie and the chocolate factory and Willy wonka fans happy I loved the novel by Roald Dahl so Im excited for this
This looks so so good 
Im something of a magician myself I can see a meme out of this already
So England is 50 black now Such horseshit
Its wonkin time then he wonked all over the place
Hugh Grant  CGI face needs work it does not move naturally with the head
Ive been waiting for this for over an entire year Freak yes
Oh yay another minority thats the real brains behind the character coz the character is a bumbling oaf that cant do anything on their own How original
When you Hollywood dipshits going to actually create something Gonna be hilarious watching this trash bomb
this guy again I mean there are other actors
OSCAR CAMPAIGN STARTS NOWWWWWWWWWWW
""
Why is there always a black kid in every movie now
my childhood star mr bean rowan atkinson is Back 
looks boring AF but if your an 8 year old that isnt very smart then this looks perfect for you
Absolutely NONE of the magic that Gene Wilder brought to the role This looks bland and boring 
Gonna watch it on my birthday  27 December 
just noticed mister bean himself is the priest lolol
Oh this made me so happy
Hehe its wonking time baby
Its Mr Bean
This looks magical
charlie and the chocolate factory the best book and the best movie of my childhood Hollywood is magic
He found the perfect role for himself I wish we could erase him from Dune LMAO
Its just Tim in a Wonka costume his acting isnt doing it for me
Love you Timmy 
dont say it is gonna be musical
Support  Ben The Don
again
The decadence of Hollywood strikes again Superhero movies remakes reboots Dont you see people are tired of all that
The Snow Piercer prequel we didnt know we needed
Ummmmm where is Jhonny Depp 
"My jaw just dropped watching Timothe Chalamet effortlessly be Willy Wonka
I am here for it"
"Screenwriterproducer  check out this original screenplay its very good

Hollywood studios  no thanks well just make another movie based on old established IPs again The writing is done for us We just cash the check"
Love love love 
The Chocolate Cartel Lmao love it
That looks absolutely terrible
They better give this man some awards in 2024
""
"does not look good the issues do not seem too large for him to over come

the bad guys  appear gentle

drop a Cruella DVill in there"
Nobody asked for this
Boring
He sounds perfectly like Johnny depp
Theres always gotta be black people sighhh  where are the other races
If Willy is secretly a wizard that explains all the weird stuff you do after eating his candy
Iba a lanzar un meh pero ese Piensalo pero en reversa y ya me he ido a la versin de Gene Wilder Ya solo necesito un poco de esa sensacion de no me importuna nada y estoy en control de mi insana locura que tena el Wonka de Wilder y el personaje ser redondo
Ok midjourney now replace timothe chalamet with anyone else
No offense to Timothy but Johnny Depp immortalized this role Why remake
UGGH ANOTHER BAD REMAKE OF AN ORIGINAL CLASSIC
boring by the looks of itat least the Tim Burton version had originality
Jonny depp is best
is this the snowpiercer prequel
So you dont want to hire little people  Got it Willy Wokea
okay im literally so excited
This looks fantastic It looks like a proper good movie I thought we stopped making those
HE IS FINALLY HERE
Reminds me of The Greatest Showman and Emily Blunts Mary Poppins rolled up in one
I normally say that we dont need yet another origin story when we got what we already have with two Chocolate Factory movies out but this one I actually quite like the trailer Plus I havent seen Paddington yet and I feel ashamed for that but I heard that it was great I have no doubt the same people who made that movie will make this movie great too
actually i dont know everything seems a little too forced Hugh Grant though he just sold me the ticket to this movie
No one can do this better than Depp its like he was born to play such characters
I hope this movie is gonna be like greatest showman and full of emotions and memorable moments
no
another woke inclusive film that feels overhyped and forced passssss
Greatest chocolate shop the world has ever seen proceeds to shut it off Will they retcon the books
yes I need to see this especially if its gonna be a musical
awww this looks really good
Looks really fun
This isnt really my kind of movie but I adore Timmy so much Ill watch anything hes in And only he could wear that costume and still be the most beautiful boy in the world 
The story of how one man overcame a cartel to become a chocolate monopoly built on disregarding local labour laws ignoring food safety testing and institutionalising a culture promoting workplace standards violations
More
At least they got the Oompas look right again
Soo much originality these days
214 Why is the Oompa Loompa trapped
I swear 1 of the guys is of horrible histories
why is he Daniel Thrasher
This looks so good
who up wonkin their willy rn
Missing Johnny Depp
I can totally see me bawling my eyes out with this one
This is going to be Delightful
Im something of a magician myself
This actually looks so good 
Hey look look 102
Dat boy TC dont miss
Looks like trash Depps is still superior
Is that my guy Matthew baynton
From the director of Paddington is all the assurance I need
150 So Willy and Paddington are brothers 
Ooooooh I cannot wait for this to come out
Eagerly waiting
Hugh Grant being the Oompa Loompas is the best thing 
This already immediately looks better than Charlie  And The Chocolate Factory 
Timothee is channeling his inner pedo in this movie
IS THAT ROWAN ATKINSON 102 141
Why
Getting real tired of these soulless cash grabs that play off nostalgia
"We can only hope Timothee Chalamets performance is just as batsht and demented as Johnny Depps  


I can tell this is going to be a trainwreck Wouldnt spend a cent to watch it"
I was hoping it was gonna be more of a dark turn since it has potential but this seems existing too
""
AND now were off to the races monetizing Dahl work because hes dead and thus can no longer object
This is going to be the biggest flop movie of the yearthis is a big disrespect for the movieour childhood is going to be ruined
Looks stupidly good 
Oh my Hugh Grant Cant wait Thank you for sharing Greetings from Essex UK
Pass
This looks like an absolutly awful movie
Why
I see Rowan Atkinson I run to the cinema 
WAS THAT ROWAN ATKINSON FR
Mr Bean Of sacred chocolate
Oh nooo   This is nothing like the Gene Wilder Wonka
Aint no way
Looks promising Also Hugh Grant as a dancing and hopefully singing OompaLoompa is a mustwatch
didnt really think this was gonna be anything but this has captured the Roald Dahl vibe better than anything else Ive seen since the original Chocolate Factory plus its directed by the Paddington guy
Part of what makes the original film magical was the mystery behind the whole factory Giving wonka a fully fleshed out back story just to cash in on making wonka chocolate again ruins that magic
guys i have a new crush
I was already enjoying the charming and wistful style of the start of the trailer but when I saw its being directed by the same guy from Paddington my excitement for this increased by tenfold
Why
This the prequel to Gene Wilders Willy Wonka
He has the spirit of gene
This looks good
And REALLY cool that they tweaked and added from the book story where Charlie is a black poor child
Great Not another woke movie Ill definitely watch it
I am deeply triggered by one thing about this movie  that Christmas is too far away a release date
Looks a Lot Better than Depps outing Paying more homage to Gene Wilders influence as the legendary chocolatier and confectioner
"Hmmm because of propganda nowadays I hate movies where there are multi race unless its modern world

Either be black or white or Asian

Propganda ruin the movie

Of course I am not blaming this movie"
Is Armie Hammer not going to be in this
"Im getting real Jared Leto trying too hard to be Joker vibes from this trailer and Im hoping its just bad takes or misrepresented

Timothee is intensely talented and I am sure he can put more effort into sounding more like the absolutely nutty young Wonka he is trying to portray a prime example is when he is asking the girl what kind of chocolate she likes the last one feels way too acted like its a guy trying to purposefully act kooky not a guy who is kooky

Ah well hoping its just out of context or bad takes and I hope that I am pleasantly surprised when it releases I really want this to be good and hope Timothee gets a chance to really act in this film and portray a truly nutty Wonka"
Im surprised new Willy Wonka isnt a POC woman
This looks bad
Go girl give us nothing
The acting is a bit cringe if you recently just watched the Johnny Depps one
Just Make New Content
Whats with all the remakes these days
Shouldve been Jeremy Allen White Timmy seems weak
This is not a very good trailer It feels like a longforgotten generic 1990s kids film That said that last scene gives me hope that the movie itself will be much better than this exhausting joyless trailer
Jonka  Put on a Forward Roll
timothee never does bad in my eye
4k good job WB
are they going to assasinate willy wonka
I love you wonk
Why its sounds like candy crush 
My favorite movie as a kid and a grown adult Looking at this makes me appreciate Gene Wilder even more Nothing against this kid but you can see its not even closeWilder was unique and didnt have to try hard This looks forced
I dont like the actor  somtehing is odd
Cant believe any white person would subject themself to this
Ok I was unsure about all of it up until the Oompa Loompa part Now I am pleased
N no
Ok I was unsure about all of it up until the Oompa Loompa part Now I am pleased
I am smiling and giggling because I feel so much joy from watching this whimsical trailer that I am now looking forward to seeing  I felt like I was a kid again and that is a great feeling to have right now I cannot wait for this movie 
Christ I lasted 30 seconds Cant anyone come up with something even remotely original  Remakes prequels sequelsno wonder big budget films keep failing at the box office
I saw him filming in Oxford
wait I thought this was a sequel to the remake not a prequelughhhhhhhhh noooooooo
Oky this actually seems good
But why the mystery of who is Willy Wonka is essential to his character
Brought to you by the same company that fired Depp without due process and stood by Amber Heard to the very end No thank you
Ahhh so this is a wonka film done right nothing against Johnny just this is less mental asylum more nutty chocolate confectioner
i see Mr bean i know which part of the movie ill be watching
Bro ngl this looks like it will be fun af the humor is on point too haha keep it poppin
Was that Mr Bean being chased by a giraffe
What a great cast 
i love this so excitedddddddddthis is one of my fav stories
MR BEAN WE WILL BE WATCHING
Oh they were fr about this LMAO
Nice idea  wrong actor  But i do hope its good
Cela manque de woke 
Looks very very promising
Timothee should stick to softspoken roles His voice is too thin to do anything this shouty
This gives off big wonk energy
No ideas left in Hollywood i see
Great Another remake of a remake So inspired
looks amazing
Its good but watching it i just think of the old johnny deep willy wonka Miss him
Woooooooooow this looks bad Gean Wilder rolls in his grave
142 mr bean
115 I dont know why but I thought of Gene Wilder when I saw Timothees expression 
Mr Beast already did this
Is this an origin story of the Gene Wilder version of Willy Wonka
Will honestly be going mainly to see Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
So excited for this
Johnny Depp always
Rowan Atkinson Did I see that right
I saw one source saying that Jim Carter was playing Arthur Slugworth but from this trailer I think it must be Paterson Joseph playing him instead
Yes There is another Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory and it is Wonka
OH MY GODDDD
WTF
Jontron One of each please Lol 021
No thank you
The last 2 months of 2023 belongs to Timmy Champagne 
Hope not another woke film
a story of a hobo Nice
My man Lance is in it 
DOGSHIT
Since when they started filming I saw the behind the scenes pictures back in 2019 someone pleases explain
Remembering you sir Johnny Depp
Just seeing Sally Hawkins my heart got warm Such an incredible and talented actress
Ohhh se ve sper genial  definitivamente que ansias de verla
cool
Thank GOD they didnt do the Johnny Depp thing and try and reboot a new Wonka universe This one clearly is trying to share the same world music catch phrases and Oompa Loompas with the superior Gene Wilder original Much smarter choice
"No How many times can they remake this Jeez
The original should have never been remadelike most originals
There are no original ideas anymore"
Wanka
Oh look like a new willy wonka movie but yeah I mostly like the Johnny Depp version of Mr Wonka You know his personality always makes me smile and laugh Also the five kids that win five golden tickets play a very important role in the movie but when I saw this new Wonka movie five kids did including me sad imagine if they were part of this movie its gonna be the best part and their evil personality especially Veruca Salt and violet Beauregard also Augustus gloop always eating chocolate
Rowan Atkinson omgg 
   
"143 
Every good thing in this world started with a dream And with dream comes responsibility"
Please dont have a running time of 3 hours  I need a 90 minute version
When the actor playing Willy effing Wonka is the least funny person on the cast
""
What a wonderful and magical Christmas present 
"no thanks
1 no real Oompa Loompas
2 A diversity hire"
The flute tune and the oompa loopa tune played at the end is the exact same one from the 1971 movie Amazing
""
Im only watching this movie for the homie Augustus Gloop
SO EXCITING
I was so skeptical about this thinking we didnt really need another Wonka moviebut this trailer definitely changed my mind
Is their only 1 kid in this movie Where are the rest of them They were the best part of the original
No Cavities  boom sfx
Is no one tired of remakes reboots and sequels
looks like the kind of movie that younger me would be completely obsessed with loved it 
At Least Johnny Depp wasnt Returning to the Sequel or Something Like That
The actual movie looks good but the actual actor for Willy wonky does not fit
"Tbh I cant hate this kid 
Hes acting is top class for being my age lol
Cants wait for dune part 2"
Where is depp
This is probably what you dream of when youre high on Melange
Chalamet can play Wonka but he cant voice him His voice just doesnt fit right idk why
Cant stand having Chalamet being rammed down my throat by Hollywood no more
""
Another movie of Willy Wonka
Timothee is gonna be brilliant in this incredible actor
TIMOTHEEEEEEEE
More like WONKER
noice
No
Timothe is gonna knock this out of the park
"This looks awful


An Sally Hawkins in this after she played Charlie Buckets mother in Tim Burtons version of  Charlie and The Chocolate Factory will be confusing for some"
It should be banned sugar is harmful
Timothe Chalamet was born for this role
OK HEYECANLANDIM
so many bots in the comments paid for by Hollywood to promote yet another rendition of an old IP but whatevs
Who agrees Timothee Chalamet did an amazing job 
I am very excited about this movie especially since my favorite actor is the main character  
Can we just like not ruin classic movies and let them just stay classic This is just gonna flop
""
So a prequel
 
THE GIRAFFE
Hmm  Maybe this will be worth watching im cinema
Nope I like Timothee Chalamet He definitely looks the part of a young Willy Wonka but he doesnt act the part and Im not interested in seeing a young Wonka film Sorry I still got the original
CANT WAIIT
aaaaaaa  me encanta
I only have one word for this trailer why
Jesse Eisenberg wouldve been better
so funny cuz to lily rose depp her ex and her dad played the same role lol
Seeing this guy all happy and jollywrapper after seeing him suffer in sheer torture for 20 episodes straight in Dune is such a weird experience lol
ok im sold
Cant wait and hope this will be a good fun musical as The Greatest Showman
Oh Timmy boy is sucha charm 3
good
"021
dark 
you meant black chocolate

oops"
new movie concepts are really gone
LAAAAAAAAAAAAME
This better have some help with Dahls family members or it wont be good
I miss Gene Wilders dry sarcastic wit The fact that a chocolate factory owner was so sarcastic and a trickster really added a depth that he had seen so much in his life I hope this movie bridges the gap between bright eyed optimist and sarcastic pseudo cynic
A must see
Wow this looks terrible
No daydreaming got me lolol
Other than a glimpse of Rowan Atkinson and a bit of Hugh Grant this looks horrifically bad  Come on filmmakers  sequels remakes prequels is all originality gone in your profession
Cant wait timothiiiiii
This looks like a very charming and uplifting movie
No one need an orgin story for a mysterious character since thats what makes them appealing and especially not of a slave owner
Cant wait Hugh Grant will be amazing Oompa Loompa D
Why is it so hard for KeeganMichael Key to not appear in some green screen budget fantasy family movie
""
Nostalgia  To be honest i didnt expect it to be good Seems like they outdid themselves  very impressive trailer Definitely watching this one
here before 1M vies
Hmmm 
""
Nice to see that hollywood is now finally making some real content I am bored of the superhero films now
Got to fill the narative and have half the cast black
I love seeing Timothee Chalamet take on a more fun role cant wait
this is cinema
I still cant believe mr bean the tv show 1990 only has 1 season and yet everyone and their mother know who mr bean is
Se ve terribleEn el peor de los sentidos
My inner child is happy
I like Timothee Chalamet and this looks like another winner for him Casting looks fantastic That ending with the Oompa loompa  Too late Ive started dancing now Once weve started I can not stop
yikes
Here we go mama  152
"Is this a musical  
Like they sing and dance for any little sentence  
Sing about  I got gum in my shoe    
If not  looks whimsical and colorful Nice cast "
Watching this
 
The collaboration we never knew we needed Harry Potter and paddington 
There are so many magicalfantasy movies coming out this year and I LOVE IT
He does his Ace Ventura impression at 23 seconds
To be fair Paddington is a masterclass in directing and storytelling
Mr bean 141
For those of you who dont know Paul King the director of the Paddington movies is a master at his craft I hope this is really good 
Oh how I miss Johnny depp herehe made the previous movie the most sweetest one
really hope this little model wont ruin the Wonka by his playing unfortunately in this trailer he does ruin it hope its just bad trailer
oddly looks good and dare i say it not woke
Sohuh  I dont know  If they nail the sense of delight this might work  TC is not a bad choice for a young Willy Wonka  I love the book and the Tim Burton  Charlie and the Chocolate Factory film  And while I love Gene Wilder and his performance I did not care for the Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory So I am coming from a literature fan perspective
"Im pretty mixed on this trailer some parts I like others not so much
I like the angle of Wonkas struggle against Slugworth Finkelgrubber and Prodnose the costume design on them and everyone else is pretty fantastic although did Matt Lucas have to be in this

I sort of like how they seem to be balancing the UK vs US issue that previous iterations have had The book editions for the UK and US were different so its hard to definitively say where Wonkas factory is Here they seem to have dialled up the American accent for Willy but have him striving to make a name for himself in the UK what with all the British actors in the rest of the trailer
The effects are looking a little weird at the moment though a bit reminiscent of the 2020 adaptation of The Witches And I can tell that the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa is going to be my next sleep paralysis demon

For an unnecessary prequel it looks like it will be decent The Paddington films are quite beloved so having most of the makers on for this seems like itll work too Just hope they throw in a bit of darkness that Roald Dahl is iconic for Maybe theyll have to kill off the new friend character of Willy to explain why shes never mentioned in the original stories its the curse of a prequel
Also wondering how this film will end since Slugworth and the others are if my memory serves me correctly still in business even when Wonka is older so presumably they cant be fully taken out of the chocolate industry by the end of this film


Also minor nitpick bit strange how Wonka makes hoverchoc when hes young but Fizzy lifting drinks werent yet being sold to the public by the time hes an older man Maybe the hoverchoc ends up disastrous and he gets in trouble for it"
"Timothe Chalamet almost feels like The Doctor here 

He could play Doctor Who

Though would be cool if he played a prequel William Hartnell Doctor who"
How many times are we going to remake this movie
Cant wait
This actually looks good unlike the last one
I think this was the Vision he had in Dune that scared him shitless
I hope Johnsons chocolate shop is called consultioconsultius
I swear I thought for a second that Willy is played by Daniel Trasher
This actually does look good
I saw Mr Bean  and wow this trailer actually looks good
ITS STRIKE STRIKE THAT REVERSE ITA
Timoti Shalame is miscast
I guess people are copying Wes Anderson movies now
    
I wonder how woke this will be
Honestly I was a bit suspicious about this movie when it was announced but now seeing the trailer Im 100 sure its going to break the box office in the first week
What a shame This looks rather horrible
The origin story I never knew I needed to know
Record amount of oh nos while watching a trailer for meeeee
ngl the no daydreaming bit was very funny
I just can see Timothe Chalamet acting like Timothe Chalamet is like if his character of Willy Wonka had his same personality sorry 
Timtothee is great and all this but to me this is all about Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
How many we gonna get is Hollywood running ideas
"NEW
IDEAS
PLEEEEEASE
Create new lowmid budget IPs and bank off any successful ones for decades Blumhouse certainly did"
I already know this movie is going to bring me to tears
Loving it all except the token black side kick  why does every film now have a mixed race or black side kid now 
Good god what a stacked cast This had BETTER be good
"OMG Another rehash of a story that has been rehashed

Hollywood has no creativity left It is an empty shell"
Idk Timothee seems like hes trying to act like gene wilder like his delivery Doesnt seems like this role fits him
they should have made willy wonka black
I one asked for this We didnt need it And we certainly didnt ask for one dimension Chalamet to be miscast yet again He was dire as Henry V in  The King and the weakest aspect of Dune
I cant wait for Grandpa Joe A Willy Wonka Story
omg rowan 0 best movie
Willy woke
Inspired casting Chalamet looks like a young Gene Wilder
"The Chocolate Cartel 
Surpisely this looks good and its a  great idea for a back story"
With a good script this could be really enjoyable to watch Trailer looks fine by me
Till December Are you kidding meeee
Not gonna lie this made me feel some kinda way
""
l never knew l needed Timothee as Willy Wonka in my life and he looks so handsome plus he looks so much like Regulus
""
Im the only one here not liking what I see unfortunately It feels like its trying too hard Hope Im wrong
Okay good to know this is a film that knows it is goofy and silly but in a way that feels sincere and full of effort and fun Not to mention the cast looks incredible and the director has never actually made a bad film so I got a good feeling about this one
"Sorry did not like this one

Loved it"
Who up wonking they willy right now
Oh my god the trailer is great Timothe is just incredible as Willy Wonka How I want to see the movie as soon as possible
I feel like we couldve had someone better for this role feels like he was just cast because he is quite popular right now
Guys seriously are you making a willy wonka movie or the origins of honeydukes 
Every good thing in this world started with a dream
Im something of a scient sorry magician 
Cant help but feel Timothee is tragically missedcast Hes not charming enough to rival Johnny Depp and not weird enough to rival Gene Wilder
This looks like nightmare fuel
""
y she black
I cant believe hes white Im so offended that they made him white
Please dont be a musical I cant stand them
Wow hearing pure imagination being played in the background at one point made me really emotional 
The fact that Willy Wonka has a backstory and Timothee is the one playing Willy Wonka and the fact theres also Rowan AtkinsonHugh grant alongside the iconic actors tells me this is going to be a hilariously good movie
Never liked Wonka but I think this one might change my mind
An absolute dream
Im not a huge fan of the trend of new movies in a series having just a shortened version of the original title but at least it wasnt shortened to Willy
Looks boring
aint no way they be making willy wonka movie again
This actually looks good
PutTimotheChalametDown
Seeing Rowan Atkinson is all i needed im sold
I love this so much Will definitely be watching
I like timothee he did a good job but why not johnny depp
This does not need to exist and looks soulless
who up wonking they willy rn
How do you know Hollywood has lost its creativity 20 years ago Theyve done nothing but remakes
I thought it was naff until I saw Rowan Atkinson Anything with him in is good
Im getting some strong Gene Wilder vibes and no trace of Johnny Depp Already off to a good start Love JD but didnt care for his version of Wonka
Is it weird that Im happy about this
We definitely did not need this remake
disappointed Kevin hart wasnt casted as the oompa loompa
Timothe Chalamet is just amazing wow
TIMOTHEE CHALAMET AS WONKAAAAAAA
looks like a Disney Musical movie
Mr Carsen is in this  Not very proper of him
Somebody messed up the captionsssss
The TRAILER MUSIC IS SOO GOOOD
Yeah 2023 where everything must be politically correct Bet this gonna flop
Letsgoooo Timothee
We did NOT need this Why another one And no more prequels
Oh no Steeling lines from the original This looks like ChatGPT wrote it
ive never seen timothee chalamet play anything but an angsty teenager so this is a bit unnerving lol
Finally hollywood is back on track
I like Timothee Chalemet but I dont like this trailer
Thank god he is not eating people but chocolates
Do we really need another Wonka movie God this is cringe
At beginning of the trailer I said why and by the end I said when
The original Oompa Loompa
This is going to be a fun movie  But sadly we all know there will be some YouTuber in their thumbnails spreading hate and saying how bad itll be  or its demonic candy for children and all that BS you cant enjoy films these days without some taking it to seriously either way ofcourse Im gonna enjoy this movie regardless out of any hate itll randomly get or complaints  Ive been seeing the word woke so much lately about this movie so fill me in on whats woke about this  Id just like to know is it about the diversity Orrrr something else
Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompa is the icing on the cake 
I smell an Oscar coming
Do you remember last time we got prequels of great movies Not good was it
Yooo they got Karl from Mr Beast to play Wonka
Yay another unnecessary reboot of a decades old franchise How exciting
Wait why does this actually look really good
Nothing will ever top the original Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory
As a kid I equally loved and feared Wonka Theres a secret to him Unknowable Perhaps even a little dark Is he lying Is he magic All of that is lost here I see a noble effort but Tim cant encapsulate Wonka
PADDINGTON HIVE RISE UP 
free willy wonka after he tapped some dark chocolate my nga
Mr bean is back
OMGG
Im not a fan of his acting skills
Willy Woka
I still love Willy Wonka that act suspicious and awkward while trying to look friendly This looks too wholesome which is also ok since well see another version
There is no such thing as white chocolate
This looks cute
I ran out of good movies to watch I so cannot wait for this anymore
Theyre not trying to remake what Johnny did Ill take it
feels like cats somehow would love to be proven wrong
Ill just wait for someone to just make a compilation of only oompa loompa scenes
I love Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompas but I wish we got a new design for them
Again why
Is there any role he cant do 
You can put hugh grant in anything
Cant wait for this shiiiid
Oh boy here we go all cliche  token inserts dei  and no heart or soul
The voluptuous Rowan Atkinson
        
cringe
Timothee Chalamet is WONKA
Im very early to this 
bro this is alr movie of the year lol
Hugh Grant really went from Bridget Jones to Midget Jones 
Im hesitant
You lazy company
This looks promising
Finally they made it without non sensical creepyness 
Why did they make a 3rd one for 
1 hour ago
I cant wait to see videos of Timothys performances in Wonka and Dune Part 2 side by side
pass
Sorry but this guys version of wonka is terrible He just looks like an overgrown 5 year old pretending to be willy wonka Maybe thats the point of wonka But it just takes away that feeling that gene brought He felt like an adult playing a big kid but still had his adult seriousness God this movie looks awful just saw the end with oompa loompa and yeaaaa not gonna bother to watch it
"This Christmas the chocolate must flow 

That sounds weird now that I think about it "
Anything made by Warner Brothers you know its a hot hit
Just glad they didnt change wonkas race for the pc crowd
Put Atention Disney
Great trailer
Who will play the menacing Grandpa Joe in this universe
Is this the prequel
WHY
This looks bad
Omg Hugh Grant at the end nothing couldve prepared me for that
Disgusting
Johnsons always cooking up a new scheme
This looks stupid but if its made by the same director of paddington then it absolutely deserves a chance
Timothe Chalamet as willy wonka is something i didnt know i needed
Hollywood being out of ideas and trying to remake a story that never needs remaking is not surprising especially with Warner Bros If this movie even does slightly well I will be beyond shocked
WILL HE WONT HE OR WILLY OR WONNY THATS THE QUESTION WE ARE ASKING
Yo is that Daniel Thrasher  I know its not
Johnny depp got screwed over by warner bros and I wont stop saying it
Rest in Peace Gene Wildermen please let this movie do some justice
Amazing
im sorry but this is the best cast 
There was no colored people in the original Willy Wonka except Oompa Lupas So already not an accurate depiction
THANK GOD ITS BASED OF THE ORIGINAL the remake is pure garbage so this really makes me happy since i think we needed some more lore to the universe
Is this the same story as willy wonka or its diferent or its a part 2 or not related
When he said here we go momma I cant lie I absolutely lost it and started crying like a baby I lost my mother recently Anyways Im beyond excited to see this movie
Cant touch Gene Wilder the guy was Wonka I will say this looks better then that disaster of a movie with Depp
Who up wonkin they willy rn
After seeing the willy wonka cereal in the store i know this would be lit
Just terrible
Wrong casting from top to bottom
thats a good video and is this movie coming this year as the first live action wonka movie
My first grade self is screaming I remember watching the other two willy wonka movies and loving them
Why does this look like Harry Potter like it literally looks like fantastic beasts or something
I want johnny depp
Wow They really ruined the Wonka franchise by casting this guy
Suprised no one has mentioned Mathew baynton the horrible histories guy
Dont know what to say
"This is so silly
 Like a childrens story that delights all ageslike the original novelPERFECT"
what what what what what what what what what what what what what what what
I like Tim Burtons Loompaland better
Man its half way to 2024 and theyre still making politically correct money grabbing spin offs This is gonna be a long ride down hill for Hollywood but hey its their money
Is this movie gonna flop
This looks fun  Bright colorful  Adds to the origins of Willy Wonka
I always thought that JD as willy wonka is irreplacable hope this movie change my mind
"Its so weird but refreshing seeing Timothee in a role where he is happy and weird and not disaffected or  sulking

Also this was made by the director of Paddington Now I have high hopes"
This is not what I was expecting  Looks like its going to be Amazing
Otro clavo al atad de Warner
The Oompa Loompa whistle at the end is legit IYKYK
needs more peach and hammer
"The number of cookie cutter fake positive comments posted at almost exactly the same time can only indicate that studio interns have incorporated AI in their inflating game
Other than that
way to ruin a classic WB"
Im shocked by this  but I feel like Timothee Chalamet is miscast in this
 
This looks like a real festive movie Weve not had one of those in years
Again
did i see mathew baynton
Love seeing key and peele as the cops 
It would be nice to have some original moviemaking
Trailers tend to be deceifful so I have no faith on this movie until I can judge it on my own
Great movie BUT something is missing
Hahaso many bots gushing fake love on this This gonna bomb hard
Not even close to johnny deep A big flop
Man this is such a good year for movies How will 2024 possibly top it Then again maybe Ive never really been a movie buff before But so many movies this year So many hits The upcoming awards season will be fire
Okay Im actually excited you can feel the wonder and respect of the source material
Ok Im impressed Im really enjoying reading Dahls stories to my son at bedtime lately so this feels timely for me
Shiver me timbers
Yaadein taaza ho gai 
This looks fun
I was on the fence with how very different this looks then I saw Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and Im on board 100
Am I the only who feels like Chalamet is doing an imitation rather than feeling like hes wonka himselfother than that looks great
I dont know you but I am here for mathew baynton
That is some unconvincing acting
You cant tell me Wonka didnt go to Hogwarts 
Is this a prequel to a Johnny Depp movie
Johnny deep is best no one can replace him
Omggggg Hugh grantttt
Paul Atreides sure have some vivid dreams
Mr bean 
"I know its early to judge but
All i could see is timothee chalamet  not willy wonka "
Rowan Atkinson This is a must watch
I hope the other chocolatiers are over the top and unequivocal bad guys because it would be so damn funny Everything else about this world is absurd they should just go for it
I really hate that adult characters all look like children now It sucks
Jhonny depp from Alibaba express 
my eyes teared up a little this trailer is so wholesome i need to watch this with my family
I heard this was supposed to be a dark spin on the storyapparently not 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE1111111111111
"This is the first time a trailer has ever got a stranglehold on my nostalgia From the way the cameras moved to the dialogue it feels like the old  Santa clause  vibes where you just immediately feel overcome with joy watching it

If this is just from the trailer I cannot wait for the actual movie"
Looks terribly bad and cliched to death
042 thats brilliant
Who up wonking their willy right now
""
Too woke they had to include a random black chick with unkempt hair
Glad Hugh grant got out of Hollywood blacklist
totally invested
I love the Chocolate factory moviesthis trailer didnt hit the vibe for me
""
Ahhh its an absolute delight to see Paddington alumni in this movie Christmas is going to be magical
Looks beyond terrible
did i just gasp at the sight of rowan atkinsonnope i paused the video played it back and made sure that it was him and gasped again
U cant recast Johnny depp in any movie 
This looks Incredible
looks good Lets hope there is some drama and tension here Not just all sweetness and floss
Im not sure how I feel about Timothee Chalamet playing Willy Wonka but this movie looks fire so Im excited
Wow Dune 2 took a weird turn
Why is there a feminine man being the role of wonka  Men are supposed to be masculine will NOT watch this
I am going to watch it i swear i am waiting for long time
Jhonny Depps Willy Wonka 
Lets see how this does My favorite movie is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory so lets hope for something good
Johnny depp 
id say Timothee Chalamet is hollywoods next big starIts looking like hell be having an illustrious career
"I miss Johnny depps Wonka 
My favourite childhood movie"
I miss Johnny
Even if its minor role its always a joy seeing Rowan Atkinson in films Cant wait to see this one the film captures the spirit of the source material so well 
Im getting whiplash bc the last movie I saw with Timothee Chalamet was Bones and all 
Timothy seems like a miscast to me hes is a very serious actor very good at brooding characters Seeing him try to be goofy and happygolucky doesnt seem to fit to me Still will be watching movie looks very good
Wasnt expecting a Willy Wonka origin story  I wonder if Slugworth is in this movie
Willy Wonka isnt mary poppinswhich is the vibe Im getting from this
Im in So wholeheartedly in
i have a feeling this would be a new christmas movie classic
"Remakes
Remakes everywhere"
142 MRBEAN
Garbage
hehe
This is 
I got marry poppin vibes from this Im sold
As a fan of the original movie this doesnt look good Not a fan of the main actor hes not him Not engaging and inspiring enough The story plot sounds interesting at least
It looks good but why does everyone know about the flying and such Usually he is the most eccentric person in the area
Se ve aburridaxd prefiero el wonka de depp
So is this a prequel
Mr Bean as the father never imagine that happening but need to happen
Im actually impressed that they kept Wonka white because of all the unnecessary race and gender swapping Hollywood does
Oh no
Ok probably Hollywood is doing good stuff now
cant wait this seems nothing like the johnny depp willy wonka or the original
More woke bollocks
This looks terrible lol
MR CARSON AND MR BEAN YESSS
Love from India Being a fan of Timothee m really excited to see him in such a new n different role he has adapted so well no doubt his acting skills r super after Dune2 we ll get to see him being so funny n entertaining the wait of coming months seems too long have never heard story of Wonka or this character but sure that Chalamet will surely make us fall in love with Wonka Christmas come soon
050 nwashing
""
No Johnny Depp  No Wonka
Plz dont make this movie woke
Oh no it looks good 
I cannot wait to see this
Paul Atreides seems to have a side gig as a candy manufacturer Is this accurate with the Duen lore
Anyone else let out a shriek when they saw Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa
Est pelcula la espero con ansias el actor como Timothy nos da esa sensacin de carisma como el antiguo Wonka de la primera pelcula y un poco tambin de el Wonka de la pelcula de Burton espero mucho est pelcula 
" Film set in the Victorian era

 somehow its full of cultural enrichment

 modern hollywood"
Im surprised that mr Bean is in this
we just gonna make a new willy Wonka every 10 years now
My headcanon is that Paul Atreides saw this alternate timeline in a spice induced fever dream and indulges in it as a kind of momentary escapism from his crushing burdens
Looks whack NGL
I still dont see TC being charismatic enough to play WW but Im still going to watch it
Chalamet as Wonka seems Off He just doesnt have that mad genius vibe that the character so desperately need
Wowww this will be the best Christmas gift from Timothee  egarly waiting
They should picture Wonka as an AfricanAsian guy with blue eyes
Timothee as wonka is something I never knew I needed but I most definitely did
Loosely based on MrBeast Feastables 
Looks good I might watch it note I did not like JonnyDeppDeepRoys version
The last 5 seconds alone make me want to see this movie
Literally nobody asked for this
"Hugh Grant
Playing the Oompah Loompahs
That man has truly reached the peak of his career"
All of this
Rowan Atkinson and Timothee Chalamet Wow such a great combination 
Im a simple man As soon I saw chocolate defying the laws of physics I booked my seat
Thats not Wonka thats Timmothy Chalmette
This looks horrible HardPass
I have always visualised Willy Wonka as someone crazier which I dont see here But well I am open to see what coming up
I thought I saw Timothee chalemat and immediately decided to watch it at first I wasnt sure if it was him but it was timothee and I am here for it
Does it look a bit Potterish tho
So a prequel for the prequel of Snowpiercer
Finally a Snowpiercer origin story
Snowpiercer prequel finally
""
Jokes on us this is the sequel after Dune 2 showing us how Paul is as Emporer
Noway  Not Timothe Chalamet Johnny Depp is really going to be bummed 
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is one of my favorite movie Really excited for this one Giving me fantastic beasts vibes
Man Timothee is this generations leo dicaprio
I would love to see a 2023 version of the chocolate factory
Its a shame Gene Wilder couldnt live to see this
In business Jeremy you learn that every man has his price And I judge yours to be fivehundredandthirtypounds
Not Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa lmao
its simple i see timothee i click
Looks good
Gene Wilder is rolling over in his grave SMDH
They couldve cast someone else but go off
So is there a point of the little girl being there or is it a diversity inclusion
Estoy emocionado se ve increble no puedo esperar a verlo Estuve mucho tiempo esperando a ver algo nuevo sobre Willy Wonka 
is it so hard to make something like original
Oh dear
This is gonna bomb This was never gonna be my cup of tea but everything Id seen leading up to this trailer looked like it could be promising for the studio But now It looks like a blended mess of ideas with no clue which it wants to follow most
Its wonkin time
what an excellent cast omgggg CINEMAAAAAA
What a miscast
Im waiting
just be glad youre you 
Looks so good
I like everything about it except Timothy as Willy Wonka Not that I dont like him hes a good actor but miscast here Ironically Rowan Atkinson would have been the perfect Willy Wonka 20 years ago
Sally Hawkins YES
This looks good
I cant wait NOW Christmas will be SPECIAL
This having the 60s and the 2005 movies aesthetics combined feels like a mustwatch
This looks magical
CGI look awful 
Zendaya looks a bit darker in this
Who on earth was timothee cast instead of Jeremy Allen white
Oh man thats good 219
I want it to be released today
"From writerdirector of the Paddington films

Say no more "
Everything good in this world started with a dream So you hold on to yours So beautiful This movie will be magical 
I know a lot of people hate Timothee but this doesnt look too bad
meh depp was way better
Can film makers think of a movie thats not a prequel or reboot I wish this generation would think of something new and quit remaking everything
Might not good as johnny depp but its interesting
WOKEA
I LOVE THIS but why do the Oompa Loompas look like that
yes yes yeeeesss
Este chico solo acta y arruina todas las pelculas igual que holland
Rowan Atkinson is here too Im sure its gonna be amazing 
THEY FIXED THE OOMPA LOOMPAS Thank goodness gracious
I knew that was Paterson Joseph  and Olivia Colman THATS NUMBER WANG
good luck Timothee wonka its a hard role ill be rooting for u
Help why did they cast thimothee chalamee for willy wonka terriblecasting 
Willy wonka is the Batman of candy 
Awesome Wonka Official Trailer
This is nothing like the original Willy Wonka  The Chocolate Factory  I really hope it is good cause i adored Willy Wonka  The Chocolate Factory I have such fond memories of watching that movie when i was a kind in the 70s
NOT Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompan
So excited 
This Wonka doesnt look at batcrap nuts as the other 2 before him Dont like it
""
Alan johnson and Sophie from Peep Show This is incredible
Looks good
flat jokes lack of inherent eccentricity that Wilder and Depp had mediocre hollywood storytellng It has all the makings of a forgettable retelling How about writers come up of some new ideas instead of redoing the same thing Lazy
omggg Rowan is in the movieeeeeeee
Well as a wise person once said It must be belived to be seen
A perfect casting would have been Jeremy Allen White Im still going to watch this it give me A Series of Unfortunate Events vibes
Usual woke bollocks
first movie im watching timothy chamomile not make a pouty bedroom face every 3 seconds lol
Honestly Willy Wonka and the Chocolate factory was such an amazing movie that made my childhood those adventure scenes inside the factory still gives me chills The values that a fictional character like Willy Wonka has is something thats commendable Would definitely watch this masterpiece in theatres 
One day there will be an original idea
Looking forward to the part where he rides the chocolate worm to prove the Oompa Loompas hes their savior and recruit them to fight the Chocolate Cartel and become Emperor Willy Wonka I of house Wonka
all those blacks in victorian england lmao  no thanks
Wow I might actually leave my house to see this
No Thumbs down Hard pass
Even tho this trailer looks absolutely banging Nobody will ever beat johnny depp
Excited  cant wait ahhhh 
this looks so deranged i cant wait
Best diabetic fantasy ever
Well Oompa loompas are in the movie i ll watch it
Took it long enough
I cant wait to never watch it though I believe it wll be a decent family christmas movie
Why are people constantly coining off original characters Now we have to make prequels to everything even the lion king is doing a prequel now too
Um ok
SALLY HAWKINS
Willy Wokea
Will he bonk ya in the chocolate factory
Dude this looks bad 
Ok I was skeptical but you convinced me  Cant wait to see it
BEAN
The Americanisation of British Literature is very Annoying Why do they all have american accents
Its perfect 
Johnny Deep where Atleast a cameo
World Still need Jhony Dep as a wonka    Correct me 
What Never imagined this to be a thing
Why ruin Wonka with Timothe Timothee is over saturated because hes popular on social media
I was just thinking about wanting another Willy wonka movie 
       
I think that if you were raised by Gene Wilder it has been years since all of this stopped making sense
102 mr bean cameo
Are you kidding me with this garbage
Hyped
Looks like Woke Wonka  Ill pass
Wonka 
So this is a prequal to the 70 Wonka because the outfit the ommpaloompa and the flute
Timothee will one day play joker in a batman movie no doubt about it
Only one Wonka
Defying Gravity I can hear the song
Ah yes The origin story of of a candy factory owner who turns a factory tour into a dangerous game where only the generous survive the impure and disfigured according to their sins and a cult of tiny orange monsters dispose of the bodies Who wouldnt want to see that
This sounds a lot like my entrepreneurial journey 
OMG Chalamethes suit fot this character 
This is so good 
No way this is amazing  Timothe Chalamet makes a great young willy wonka
Does Hollywood have any original ideas at all
we love to recycle and ruin successful intellectual properties to serve the gaping maw of profit extraction dont we folks
You know because I love Willy Wonka I want to look forward to this But so far it looks dumb
Why does Willy Wonka have to be American  I dont think he was ever American
Hugely unpopular opinion Chalamet is hot but not very talented
WAS THAT THE ORIGINAL MOM FROM THE ORIGINAL MOVIE
So cuuuute I love the original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory I appreciate the origin story
Honestly wish theu chose a different actor
Can we at least agree that casting Jeremy Allen White over Timothee Chalamet wouldve been a cool homage to Gene Wilder
timmys so versatile when it comes to his roles

"Im convinced hes a wizard it so would fit lol
swear he was floating twice in this trailer  XD"
This looks fun
there is no life I know to compare with pure imagination living there youll be free if you truly wish to be
I know that a lot of people were calling for a black woman to play Wonka and were irate about Timothee possibly getting the role but this looks wonderful A great Christmas movie about candy and its set in winter Its going to be wonderful
I saw Mr bean 
Bro this looks way better than I thought Now Im excited to see this
Next movie franchise in the making
this again
Missing Johny Depp
its time to stop
Oh I really hope this is good These prequels scare me sometimes but this looks so cute
This trailer shocked Me lets hope the movie is better than the trailer
the TB disaster is forgiven WB does it  again
idk its not giving willy or wonka
I can only imagine Johnny Depp As Willy Wonka 
Hugh Grant what are you doing here loca
Paul MuadDib Lord of House Atreides is also WONKA 
johnny depp
"They could make a new Wonka every so often and not ever make the same movie twice  No complaints here
Theres a lot more content in the book left to mine "
Its Alan Johnson from Peep Show 108
""
This will BOMB
I was curious if we would see Oompa Loompas I was not disappointed
For one more time Timothe Chalamet proves that he is the most promising and talented actor of his generation  
Ok watching this now in theatres
Director of Paddington and the producer of Harry Potter seeing and recognising the actors that are in this and that its a prequel to a the chocolate factory which was a favourite when I read it in school Pretty hype for this movie 
Man Timothy is really putting a lot of effort into selling the lunacy Very effortful
Hello dune
"Oh dearnow Willy Wonka has been Wokified
Ill be sticking to the previous 2 versions Good job I have them on DVD I wont be watching this"
Looks fun and I swear this looks like it stars danielthrasher Id watch THAT for sure
Why is this twink fricking everywhere
No jhonny Depp should do it
Bro cant act We missed out on having Ryan Gosling SMH
I feel my the sugar increase in my blood  And the rise of my diabetes
Does anyone recognize some of the places we saw in HP  FB
they gave Willy Wonka a heart a story where it all started yeah
Timmy Im so excited for this movie 
guys tims gone silly
Stupid unoriginal and boringPedowood is dead and rightfully deserved
WHY Just leave it alone and come up with new film ideas instead of killing classics time and time again 
Jhonny Deep as WILLY WONKA holds my heart from Charlie and the Chocolate Factory 
It shouldve been Jeremy Allen White but I do love me some Timmy Cham Cham
gaaaas se re maluca
It looks really good but is Hollywood done with making funbright movies Even all the Disney live action movies have this dark look and so emotional Lets bring fun back
From the Director of Paddington CONSIDER ME SOLD
No thank you but I appreciate the intention
Timothee seems like such bad casting
No one can replace Johnny Depp
Is it woke
""
I like that they made it extremely different from Johnny depps version This looks more like a Harry Potter movie
Woka
I am very exited to see timothy chalamet as legendary billy wonka
Watching this biting into a Cadbury Silk Ganache  I can feel the magic I mean this flavor this is what Willy Wonka was aboutthey nailed it
Black cops from that time hahaha nothing forced
The concept of Wonka starting out and taking on the Chocolate Conglomerate only leads to a tragic tale where Wonka himself actually becomes the conglomerate The rebel against the establishment becomes the establishment Whimsy to tragedy in 2 hours
December 15 
Mr Bean
I hope they bring back the original Oompa Loompa song
This litteraly the most soulless largest excuse for a cash grab ever Same kinda characters antagonists and plot points as every other kids movie and sequel thats been pumped out since like 2019
I like the part when he said ITS WONKIN TIME literal chills
this is going to be fantastic i know timothee has done excellent job and we get rowan atkinson too this is definitely a  must watch
not lily rose depps ex playing the same iconic character her father is famous for playing
Im just glad its a new story and Tim Burton has nothing to do with itIm in
"Timothee Chalamet has the emotional range of a teaspoon 

Dude looks like a wet flannel the whole trailer 

Hes easily the worst thing about this movie and thats such a shame"
YOU LOSE GOOD DAY SIR
Love seeing song artists try cinema Looks like a fun movie lil mabu
Someone tell danielthrasher that Tim Chalamet stole his whole look for this film
I was having somewhat of a bad week so seeing this made me lift up a bit
I refuse to accept this Gene will always be Willy
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD IM READY
This looks like a good movie that Ill never watch
Im screaming crying throwing up punch me in the face Ahhhh Give it to me now
I will be murdered for this but the story seems very interesting I am just not sold on the casting choice for Wonka yet
RELEASE GODZILLA X KONG TRAILER PLEASE 
Not sure how to feel I think it needs to be brighter and more colorful but maybe it will be later on with the factor parts to contrast the rest of the world
Hm definitely has a big Harry Potter vibe to it
omggg
That Willy Wonka is making me feel things
This looks more promising than the 2000 version of Willy Wonka I mean Charlie and the chocolate factory Now this one might make you wanna get some chocolate bar before you enter the theater
This looks so bad
If only Timothy Chalamet decided to act for this one
The main character from the bear wouldve better
I did not blink once during this trailer that proves that this movie is pure imagination
Roman Atkinson for the role of old man Wonka
Looks a lot better than Disneys liveaction remakes
Did we need another origin story
How many black characters can you shoehorn into a Willy Wonka origin story This is just getting sad now Hollywood 
No
Cant help but this actor looks and acts like danielthrasher
The African Version of Willy WonkaYou could not pay me to go see this Woke Crp
anyone notie about willy 
"Why did they make another Willy Wonka movie for Hollywood writers really are completely out of original ideas for stories to make movies about that is why they just keep rehashing and remaking old movies 
Sorry I probably wont be watching this one"
Mr Bean
What They cant make Charlie  The Great Glass Elevator movie
oof
I wonder what horrifying end the little girl will meet
This looks absolutely delightful cant wait
Say it with me now Timothee Chalamet
Oh my God Its going to be a fantastic movie
 no God please NO
Is it just me thinking Timothy looks like Tom Holland and they both can play Wonka  Im sure not all of you is impressed by Toms acting but I love both of them
HORRIBLE HISTORY GUY
Yo this kid is giving me Gene Wilder vibes Im loving it give me my presale tickets NOW
""
This actually looks like a good prequel
Wohoooooo
Wtffff
"El crtico  Mediocre y Clich

Josh  Shhh  No cuestiones Solo gozalo"
oof
Please make this a game
Mat Baynton Yes
Lmao he looks adorable as Willy Wonka He actually suits the character really well  Cant wait for the movie to come
my childhood movie
no
Do anybody roald  dahl
This actually looks pretty good
Ah yes The Nepo Baby strikes again Nice
Do anybody roald  dahl
I always thought the magical things were secret and kept within the factory Im not quite sure yet what to think of this but it has spirit and looks whimsical so itll definitely make an entertaining Christmas movie Will probably watch
He has to take his acting to whole another level He has to respect and be at par with what Johnny Depp did And Johnny set the bar a little too high
I mean of course Charlie And The Chocolate Factory needed a prequel to fill in Willy Wonkas backstory Of course it did Why wouldnt it
I love both Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory as well as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory So I cant wait to see this
141 Rowan Atkinson
How many times will Hollywood enter this cheat code
Omg timmy
I still dont know how I feel about Timothee chalamet playing Willy wonka
Okay So I havent seen it yet and I give it a 10 out of 10 This trailer was more entertaining than the Previous Movie made Not the original In fact if I had one complaint is that they showed too much I feel like I saw the movie already
This looks like absolute utter garbage
Who is the forced silly companioncant beat Gene Wilder
I seen a oompa loompa Im sold 
I feel like if Gene Wilder was alive today he would be happy to see this film
Looks magical   cant wait 
EhIm not digging his take on Wonka Usually he plays characters that are very different from his actual personality and this just looks like Timothee Chalamet playing himself and doing a satirical impression of Wonka lol But Im open to see how it turns out
I want to see this film
"Producer Guy So you have a completely new original movie for me
Screenwriter Guy What But no we never
Producer Guy Just kidding wed never take a risk like that So what nostalgic property are we milking today"
This actually looks amazing Id lowkey love to see this in theaters
"Feel like this is an all sizzle and no steak kind of vibe 
He seems too level headed to be willy wonka I kind of feels its a character we should never fully understandbelieve like Gene Give me mrbean as wonka anyday"
I mean I love Timothee Chalamet but he is just not doing it for me as Willy Wonka
AAAA CANT WAITTTT FILM KESUKAAN AKUUUU SEPANJANG MASAAAAA
i love how this is a prequel to the iconic gene wilder willy wonka and not the more recent one wilder was always my favorite wonka and i look forward to seeing timothees spin on the role
Let me guess at the end or the credits we will see a kid named Charlie
Was not expecting The Greatest Showman starring Willy Wonka but Im here for it all the same 
Bloody sweet 
meh
Please dont go woke
Im not going to get my hopes up
Wowgonna watch this movie with my family
Im going to use the word chocolate carell in my daily vocabulary
Oompa Loompa about to do the Ice Spice dance
"Woah wait rewind to see 
Rowan Atkinson"
Timmy you are outstanding
Hm Looks and sounds a bit like a BurtonElfman imitation
this is gonna eat so hard
This movie had better have that same tone the original had where it seems fine as a kid but as you get older you realise how messed up it was Otherwise it just wouldnt be fun
"WOW Ive never seen more commenters with This channel doesnt have any content  in one place

Its almost like they arent real people"
Great Another Willy Wonka movie
willy Wonka finna sell peach flavored chocolate
Do we have absolutely no original ideas left in hollywood Does anybody have any creativity down there or is ripping off a movie and a book together the best yall can do The wasted potential to create a new franchise here is painfully obvious
Willy Wonka and Johnny Depp are much better and the black girl was put there only because of tolerance
This looks fantastic and magical
I hate to be closed minded but Gene Wilder set the bar so high as WW that it seems hard to appreciate the character done by anyone else
Diversity is always the main point of movies these days Not good storytelling Thats why theyre flopping This seems the same
I miss johny depp
      
I am so excited for this film looks fantastical
God I fkn hate this kid
So far freaking awesome He is a bit shorter then usual but maybe their will be others that will be little people sized like the original
Man can make people fly but uses it to sell chocolate
"Hes good

TOO good

Every other young male actor in Hollywood right now watching Timothee Chalamet"
""
lol did they used the luxury mall in Milan for Wonkas shop  All these movies look identical Overproduced tacky kids movies without actually specifically being for kids
Yeah before he colonized oompa loompa land and enslaves the oompa loompas like the highlight of peoples career back then was to work a factory one day like it was a dream job and Charlie bucket cant wait This shouldve been a dark comedy at best where wonka devises ways to market his factory as the highest standard of regulations but in reality people go missing original workers like grandpa Joe where kicked out of the job because of the newly arrived oompa loompas have some corporate espionage going on to something besides a happy go lucky wonka
OK this convinced me its gonna be a great Christmas movie
Is this movie connected with Johnny Depps Charlie and Chocolate Factory movie
Another one Jeeze
This trailer just confirmed my initial opinion that this is an absolutely unecessary prequel not a single person asked for This just doesnt seem to fit into the original Wonka timeline or even the Burton one for that matter
Yay
Really ran out of ideas
""
Yo
Finally not a whole movie 
Johnson
Why is wonka not black Why isnt everyone black 
I THINK Timothe is trying to pull off a manic Doctor Wholike vibe with his Wonka but it just doesnt work for me something in his eyes and delivery isnt selling me on it
Yikes 
is mr been in this movie 
willy wokea and the cultist factory
No
Everyone wait hold on is that from mr bean 141
Could they have picked a less charismatic person to play Wonka
OK OK giggled a lil teared up a bitmama has some veteran comedy actors young new talent plus an shining star Think the recipe is right ITS WONKA 80s90s childhood memories of watching it almost once every week or every two weeks both at homeTBSTNT every summer plus as the movie choice at the community center summer camps Hope the story is good
we love the ORIGINALITY of Hollywood
Hes no Gene Wilder
Gene Wilder would be proud
love Chalamet but of all people him as wonka 
gene wilder wouldve probably hated it but itll still be good probably
Omg this looks so good I was very pessimistic when I heard this was being made but it looks amazing
you brand loyalists eat anything tf up apparently all it takes is sticking a famous logo in your face disney grade cgi and a popular actor in a role that should probably be played by a younger person and or a child for the average adult movie goer to throw all their money at it wtf happened to REAL MOVIES
Im so excited
"Wow this looks weird I see theyre attempting to make a prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory meaning this is going to be barely based on the Roald Dahl books

Really wouldve been better making a movie following up the Tim Burton adaptation which was much more faithful to the books"
POV your here before it mega viral
Why is there black people in this movie
I Was Here 818009 views
Nobody wanted this nobody i mean nobody can replace Johhnydepp
Just when I think I love Johnny depp as Willy wonka yall come out w these epic ness 
Oh this is bad bad

Okay Hugh Grant is the cherry on top of this trailer
These people just love losing money
THE GREATEST SHOWMAN

Man timmy is in everything now
why
"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory remade

This is abousolutely Amazeballs "
We already have Mr Beast
BROOOOO YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS
CANT WAIT
This seems kinda fun
Dude straight up looking like Billy The Kid
Ohhh happy  to see
I can see how this was produced by the producer of Harry Potter  the train scene and the wide shots look magical
Nobody talking about mr bean 
The film of the holiday season
Aah goosebumps Willie wonka is back  But alas i didnt like the lead role play by him I dont think he fits that insane and funny role
Johnson
Great Engenuiyi
i get a young jim carey vibe off this actor
Johnny Depp is the most perfect willy wonka for me His role in charlie and the chocolate factory is very entertaining Lets see if Chalamet does justice to this role
"I love the original Willy wonka and I like Timothy Chalamet That being said theres seriously something lacking in this film I can tell I dont know how to describe it but its little thingsTimothy with an American accent makes this less believable Him having a black female sidekick is clearly a box to check for the academy to give it votes The actors look like they are trying too hard 

Willy wonka was a step above character because of how relaxed he was in all situations showing a sense of I have this under control no matter how dire the situation may be which left us calm relaxed and light hearted in the face of a serious situation such a losing kids on a tour

He was the main character but you couldnt tell if he was an antagonist or a protagonist Charlie and his grandpa were the protagonists and I think that gave gene wilder more freedom to be relaxed as a character And that means something to the attraction of a film 

I watched Tim burtons version for about a half hour before I shut it down I like burton films too and this seemed good but depps depiction was almost too relaxed with not enough humor Its hard to live up to wilders performance but it is what it is

An actor like Tom hardy could pull this role off because its so out of his norm of character to play which makes it interesting I think thats what it would take

This all comes from only seeing one trailerI hope my analysis is proven wrong"
Whoa Dune 2 is way different than I expected
I went into the trailer thinking this is gonna be a mess But honestly theres a level of whimsy to it that really sold me Also Chalamets giving off lots a Gene Wilder energy and thats always a good sign
RIP hollywood
After Barbie this is 
I am sorry but wonka felt little off for me maybe because of what Johnny Depp showed me and how i imagine wonka to be
I love this movie love india
Feels like Candy Crush
Releasing on my birthday I love you Timothy Chalamet
Why does it actually look great
""
90 green screen script written by AI humor for a room temp IQ The original is a timeless classic that still holds up today I dont even want to finish this trailer Ill pass
   L 
wonk
Boring
Ok I wasnt that excited for this movie when we first heard about it but now I really wanna see it lol
I cant believe Timothy is acting this crazyyy but I love it
The remake NO ONE asked for No thanks
Looks like a movie thatll show TC cant be a lead in everything lol
bean
This looks awful
MORE CG LETS GOOOOOO
So are they basing this off the 70s movie rather than the original book
Rowan Atkinson is way over hyped
Mr Beast  The Biopic
"Dune 2 looks quite different from the first 
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe"
Snoop Dogg should start his own chocolate brand
We are getting this instead of paddington 3 This better be worth it
i dont know if timothee chalamets got that underlying insanity to him that gene wilder and johnny depp created
Stop Just stop
Johnny Depp is the best character ever who present Willy Wonka
MrBeast 
Omggg 
sry but no one can beat johnny depps wonka
Wow Willy Wonka is back again but now showing us his past in more detail and how he made his chocolate factory that will be impressive you want to see it
Its awesomeit amazingit perfect
OMG i am SO excited for this film 
"The animation is not at all upto the mark
Disappointed "
Always assumed Wonka was an eccentric madman because of years of absurd wealth and isolation Turns out he started exactly like that and the whole chocolate baron thing had little effect on his personality
Im sorry but NO If youve seen the performance that Gene Wilder put on in the original film anything else is just not going to be good enough And didnt we already see a horrible remake of this with Johnny Depp STOP REMAKING CLASSICS
I will be watching
Cant wait til some original content comes out and not this worn cloths that gets throw in the washer with different stains You guys are more brain fried than a chicken glazed in explosive oil
This looks so good
Timothy is channeling Abed from Community
Nice to see a white actor playing a classic white character Thank God Disney didnt touch this one
I love some of these actors but omg this movie looks absolutely terrible
Dune Call Me by Your Name Beutiful Boy Wonka The King Bones and All Little Women His range is absolutely wild If he can pull this off just damb He is like a chameleon except he does not need to lose and gain weight like Christian Bale He is the next DiCaprio
So disappointed  Why isnt Willy Wonka an ethnic minority Such a lost opportunity 
No one saying it so I will Matt Baynton Long live the six idiots Im so sick of prequels and origin stories but for his sake I hope its a good movie
maybe its just me but willy wonka is suppose to be weird mysterious and kinda intimidating im sure this will be a fun movie but it doesnt seem like timothy has captured the vibe of willy wonka
Ooof i like Timothy but this character is absolutely iconic and Im just not sure he can fill the boots of Gene Wilder nobody really can  Ill be seeing Dune 2 but probably skipping this one sorry Timothy 
Ok this actually looks really good 
Meh pass I hate musicals
They did the original Oompa Loompa look  this looks so good
Booooo this ridiculous remake Gene Wilder is and will forever be the one and only Wonka
Hollywood is sure out of original ideas This looks absolutely boring
When I heard the Pure Imagination in the background music 
Does anyone have an original idea anymore
Willy Wokea 
Youre a Wizzard Wonka
""
No thanks
Looks forcefully woke
Omg Charlie and the chocolate factory
Was that mr bean
There is no version in the world like Johnny Depp
Looks Willy Willy Baaaad
Miss Johnny depp 
Formulaic the Formula the Movie
Wow their making Wonka again after Johnny Depp remake first Gene Wilder Johnny Depp and now  
"Timothe Chalamet is really taking his superb skills to the beyond by starring in everybodys fav iconic chocolate maker

Great to see Rowan Atkinson return as that nostalgic zany and beany priest from that hilarious weddings episode 

A surprise to be sure but a welcome one as Hugh Grant dances to that familiar memorable 1971 melody"
I definitely want to see this movie
Wonka looks too young I am not a fan 
Dune part 2 looking very spice induced
Why does he sound like Tom Holland
"Theres no earthly way of knowing 
Which direction we are going"
That was the one thing I found weird about the other two films he had candy with unique abilities but none were ever made public
Wow a lot of many iconic British actors in this
Reallya musical
Im confused if this takes place in England or America  I dunno Im bored with prequels sequels and remakes But I suppose this might turn out to be one of the better ones
Cant wait 
Now I want chocolate
bruh how many versions r they gna make of this movie leave it alone
God loves you and takes care of you so that this message reaches you God is the one who created this great universe and has complete control over it And the greatest loss that a person loses in this life is that he lives while he does not know God who created him knowing the Messenger of Muhammad the last of the messengers and the Islamic religion the last of the heavenly religions  The great intelligence before you believe in something or not is to read it study it and understand it well and then you have the choice to believe in it or not I advise you on this now before you do not have time to do that
Im so glad its referencing the original movie 
They really did run out of new movie ideas huah
Bro when I saw Mr bean my jaw dropped
Its giving me Jingle Jangle vibes
Didnt know Willie liked dark chocolate
Never been interested in a movie about Willy Wonka It seems this is the first one I am going to watch
Hugh
meh
A Know Chocolate issued by Sydney Corporations Pte Ltd Pnimles Lyctender Paper Labels of Chocolates was finally issued by WillyWonka Factory in 1993th yr because of chocolate wax contaminations 
This origin story looks better than having a dentist father who hates sweets
See this is why I stopped watching movies  just prequels and sequels
First of all Tim Burton already gave us Willy Wonkas origin story More importantly Wonka doesnt need an origin  he just exists The appeal of the character is that hes a mystery and what little we do learn about his past in both the novel and the 1971 film more than suffices your imagination fills in the gaps The character works because hes mysterious and because we can never be sure if hes telling the truth or not
Everything looks amazing but im gonna need some serious convincing that thats Wonka Wheres all his goof gone
A small black girl companion At that time period In that social status Localized entirely in that geographical region
Im sorry to say but Timothee Chalamet isnt cut out for this role he is as vanilla as possible The craziness which is needed cant be faked by acting it needs to be your original personality
""
This actually looks pretty good
This looks TERRIBLE   The actor portraying Wonka looks like hes trying to do Johnny Depp not Gene Wilder  How pathetic
big meh
This is gonna be an EPIC FAIL
Creatively bankrupt
litttttttttttt 
Im gonna say it Hes hot But I really do not like his acting Like in anything
I was not expecting the trailer being this good
Sorry but from what i just Saw i am not feeling it He sounds like Normal Timothee it doesnt feel like he is playing a different person
Too many blacks in this wtf
i was sold on this within the first 15 seconds
ive never been more excited for christmas
This looks  havent been this impressed with a trailer fora while  definitely tuning into this for sure
Omg too freaking good I loved it
WHATwhy Timothee
Fine Ill give this one a shot I could use a feel good movie
So is this is before he becomes Johnny Depp or Gene Wilder
Great this film isnt a new version of the Charly and the chocolate factory
Wow this looks really bad
Amazing 
A prequel looking to combine both the 1971 and 2005 universes
102 Now this is the part I am most excited about
im ready for christmas
Boi Im watching it
Just here for Rich Fulcher
 Great idea tell  how Wonka came to be
I have been a huge fan of both CATCF movies since i was a kid this makes me really happy
Im so surprise its between Gene Widler to Johnny Depp but now Timothee Chalamet will be Wonka Its incredible Im so excited to see it
Not another remake of thiscant we come up with new ideas instead of redoing the same stuff over and over
Our bean is back 
why i will not watch this movie 025
Omfg Timothee is sooo cute 
Another wonka film
I just cant do it There is only one Wonka and his name iswas Gene Wilder RIP
too many black people in this sick of it
Looks horrid
such absolute bliss having Chalamet as Willy Wonka
This actually looks quite promising Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa caught me off guard but its kind of perfect
Mr Bean is in there Might actually be pretty good then
i have to be honest this looks super boring and Im rly disappointed but i will watch it before i decide
I just did not see Rowan Atkinson Fck
Looks good Even better knowing that Rowan Atkinson is in it
Wait is that mrbean in the elevator 102
Cant beat johnny depps willy wonka film
Charlie in the chocolate factory
Im actually excited for this movie and hope that it does good
Hey Mat Baynton is in this  Gonna watch just for him even if its a small role
A movie that I did not think we needed and  still dont think we need
Im something of a magician inventor  chocolate maker
Hey look Hollywood is mocking the Church  I am sooooo surprised
Trop nul cest beaucoup trop Disney
  check the translation from Russian
Timothe Hugh Rowan Lets go 
I SCREAMED WHEN I SAW ROWAN ANKISTONITS LIKE A DREAM COME TRUE
Why do they need to fill every English story with  diversity
Yesterday I thought this movie trailer will come out next month or two Apparently I was wrong
Hugh Grant as an Oopma Loompa is E V E R Y T H I N G  And in close second is Rowan Atkinson running away from a giraffe  Looking forward to the big screen experience for this one
This looks great a blending of Wonka and I never thought of how good a prequel could be
Il stick with the original
Ive never been a Timothe Chalamet fan But this might be the thing that converts me
Ah the movie about Mr Wonka the pedophile with an perfect alibi and tool to lure children
WHATTTTT OMG
Timothee I hate him so much cuz I seen so many reports say he never earns or works for his roles he gets them all handed him like tf bro lazy a actor and also I saw he makes girl uncomfortable on set smh I will never watch a movie with this loser in it
I wanna see this and this looks so good Prequel to how Willy Wonka made his chocolate
Rowan atkinson omggg
so very slayyyy
Wish they had Depp do this again
Okay it made me smile it made me laugh Im charmed Ill watch it
It looks a bit too cringe for me but Im probably not the target audience Kids are So if they enjoy then good for them
Im curious what strong female character they will bring in to show Willy how to make chocolate and run a business
Wow 
Why make it we aleesxy had a einka film by Tim burton
No one asked for this
"Aku dah capek mikir 
Kamu punya MR Bean kamu punya kuasa"
Magnifique
Ok but who is she  WHY
anything to make a woke buck
Jonka
nah this looks so good captures the magic of willy wonka so well
omg baaaangggg
But Why
Hugh Grant playing the Oompa Loompas is so unexpected but perfect at the same time lmao
Cant beat the johnny depp willy wonka
Lets goo my boy timmmy
This is awesome  
For the love god i love the wonka movies please dont Ruin this one  Like how disney have
idk yet what to feel about this but why does there have to be a  i dont think it adds anything relevant to the plot oh well anyway rowan atkinson and the oompa loompa can carry for now
Willy wonka and Kylie Jenners factory aka Kylie cosmetics
Oh look another remake
Alright looks good
i dont usually tear up from trailers
Interesting is reallt getting my attention
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa whats not to love
Didnt expect the legendary Mr Rowan Atkinson to be in this movie I bet the comedy elements will be top notch
If Only the one and only Gene Wilder were still with us today would LOVE to hear his thoughts on this
"I still think the prequel is unnecessary but Im nevertheless impressed with what they came up with
Now Im obliged to watch this when it releases"
No
Woke garbage
The best Christmas move
This is already my favorite movie Willy Wonka is truly the best fictional character of all time
"Must we remake everything again and again Come on
watches trailer
Oh alright thats yeah Im down for this"
Oh so I finally have a movie about my name even I dont remember exactly why I named this 
There are so many things I can say about this but I cant wait for this movie It has everything WAIT scratch that reverse it But it looks perfect Im getting so many vibes from the original Gene Wilder And the end was something I didnt expect but I loved it
Mathew Baynton and Rowan Atkinson
Kind of wishing they had been more progressive in casting an actual Oompa Loompa
i have such high hopes for this film chalamet is an extraordinary actor and even at such a young age his range is definitely something to praise i think i have watched almost all the films he has been in but this is something entirely different i hope the final product is as magical as i expect it to be cant wait for december
Looks awful
""
MY JAW DROPPED WHEN I SAW ROWAN ATKINSON
Man I cant wait to watch this one for sure Like Willy Wonka has been one of my favourite fantasies coz I love chocolates 
Look nice
Is this the same universe as Johnny Depp
"Esta Pelicula Salvar a Warner de la Bancarrota
Con Suerte las Familias Irn A Verla"
Just stop
Not gonna lie definitely came in pessimistic with priors that this was gonna be another hollow exhausting and unmotivated reboot but by the end idk this actually looks really charming
140 RUN AWAYYE
What when how whaaaaaat
Umm The flavour of HP 
What when how whaaaaaat
omg finally
Wonka to the world of Wokes would be a more appropriate title
I cant wait for the Willy Wonka Cinematic Universe
Fcking Finally
I spend my whole life watching Johnny Deep as Willy Wonka Now my heart cant accept Timothee as Willy WonkaEven I know he is doing great
I know we dont need it but if they do a sequel to this during the events of the original as a sorta reboot And then maybe a third movie with charlie as the head
This looks wonderful I cant wait to see it this Christmas 
Hopefully a cameo from Johnny Depp
Rowan Atkinson running away from a giraffe dressed as a priest Im in
Will the movie show how he became a psychopath that started to kill children in his own factory and make songs about it
Something about his performance feel off Its like hes doing a Willy Wonka impression and not acting as Willy Wonka
LOL  Hollyweird doesnt have an original thought  Not only do they keep repeating the same formula over and over they continue to remake the remakes  Its beyond pathetic
hope they let it rest after this tho
Hugh Grant as an OmpaLumpa
Timothe Chalatme you beauty
Huh charming
I thought this was was already out  wasnt this announced back in 2021 or something
Stop Making British Characters American
""
Looks good just wish it was more Mighty Boosh than Paddington
Great casting but still not convinced about TC as Wonka 
Im hype for this
noooooo the best is wonka of jhonny depp
Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 1971 STILL is the BEST Version
Timothy chalamet going from Dune to this is one of the biggest whiplashes Ive ever seen and Im honestly kind of here for it
The chocolate factory
152 THIS MUSIC IS THE GREATEST TRAILER MUSIC THE WORLDS EVER HEARD TRUE
Im something of a magician myself
Am I supposed to believe this is a young gene wilder Wtf
yeah no thanks
760k views in one hour Definitely bots
Mr Chalamet is really good at capturing elements of Depp  Wilder and making it his own
Lil Mabu
No no no no no
No no no what
OK Im excited for this How he got to be a big chocolate factory is something I have wondered as a child and answered as an adult
Prequel to the Gene Wilder Willy Wonka then
Huh I think this is the first time I like the story of the amazing chocolatier
Can to see how willy woka became to be
Its funny how this is so fantastical and cheery when in the original he kept leaving behind children
Im just paying attention to Mr Bean at 141
I will say the casting director nailed it
"AH
 my world of pure imagination"
This could ruin my child hood or not but it must have some good jokes or else I will be depressed
Omggg this looks so good
HOPE they do The Great Glass Elevator and future films because this franchise will run and run
02 seconds in  im already out
I prefer this take on the Oompa Loompa so much more than the synchronized clone CGI abominations we got with the Johnny Depp version Though I did like the overall style of that movie a lot This one looks very squeaky clean and sterile by comparison
All the chalamet fangirls flooding this comment section
""
I love this trailer Its gonna be an amazing movie This year has so many amazing movies cant wait to watch all of them
Ill admit I wasnt very amused by the idea of this movie but now that I saw a trailer I actually wanna see this
Johnny Depp AKA Willy Wonka 
""
Right I am sick of this Can we not FOR ONCE have Wonka thats BRITISH
this looks like so much fun i cant wait
This is a very hard role  Not 100 sold on Timothee here  but I will hope for the best
Wow this looks great and very epic and magical and I like the actor a lot he is one of my absolute favorite actor ever 
The final result of project Zeus
Cant wait to watch this even though it probably sucks
Tbh its nothing compared to Johnny Depps portrayal
MR BEANNNNNNNN IS IN THISSSSS
looks like a good time
This movie looks like its gonna be a blast definitely watchin this 
not a fan of the actor but good casting choice
wtf is this garbage
WONKUH PUT YOUR EVERLASTING GOBSTOPPER AWAY WONKUH IM NOT COMING INTO YOUR CHOCOLATE FACTORY RIGHT NOW WONKUH
This new ai is very impressive
ok but why did the side character have to be black
"Yes another Willy Wonka and The Chocolate Factory movie This was my favorite childhood movie

Lots of likes"
Why do they gotta remake and ruin classic movies just come up with an original idea for once Hollywood SMH
Warner Bros testing the water if they can replace johny deep for the next Pirates of the Caribbean
D
i have a strange feeling that this is gonna FLOP hard
WHOOOOOO
     
Omg
Im still waiting for a version of charlie in the chocolate factory where hes black as roald dhal originallly intended before his publisher forced him to change it
Seeing Rowan Atkinson is the only thing that makes me wanna watch it But  as a JOHNNY DEPP wonka version prequel they shoud have straighten his hair plus more powder on his face But meh they gonna reboot it as usual
who up wonking they willy rn
Enough time to binge the other movies first
i hope this turns out to be amazing
 
Wonkalicious
this movie looks awesome cant wait to see it
From the studio who bought you Harry Potter and Xmen
             
I wish they would stop making remakes but maybe lll watch this because Mr Bean is in it
Looks like fun one for sure
YESSSSS willy wonka is one of my fav movies
Best trailer so far this year
When I saw the words harry potter I was like omg that Reggies fancast
I love thissssss
Not again
CHOCOLATE POWER
Chocolate Cartel Now theres a cartel Id like to deal with
Didnt he also unite the Oompa Loompas and take the planet back from the Harkonnen
This feels like it will take you on a beautifully nostalgic ride but with a fresh new perspective
""
Great cast Was this shot in a mall
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD
Im usually a skeptic when it comes to remakesprequelsreimaginings but this looks so cute Its nice to see Timothee in a more whimsical role and some of my britcom faves are in it too
Honestly he shouldnt be willy Wonka he is far to serious Wonka has a higher voice and is more childlike he plays it as a normal person whoxh is he not
I like depp and wilder
I just purchased a chicolate and got notification of this 
Rhold dhal is the goat
Why is there a black supporting actress with the character Wonka There hasnt been any history of Wonka with a black little girl
Oh god another version of Willy wonka
THIS IS PERFECT I got 100 happier seeing that timmy is Wonkaaa
High school production with planks of wood using deep fake technology Will be forgotten like the last one
Im Calling it  Willy wonka is the same universe as Harry Potter
"Every good thing in this world starts with a dream So you hold on to yours
 Willy Wonkas Mom 2023

That line got me crying Its sounds like something my mama would say to me"
Glad they didnt change his race
Looks like we got another Willy wonka movie
The trailer looks magical I cant wait to watch it And oh is that Rowan Atkinson I remember he was also in another Roald Dahl adaptation The Witches Seeing him again makes me smile 
Truly looks like one of the worst movies to come out in years
Damn timothee is very charismatic in this role
I like the one with Johnny Depp better
I was hoping it would be darker since he was playing Wonka But I do not think this is going to be as good as previously predicted Very Harry Potter Prequel vibed
just stop already
This doesnt look very good
This will either be absolutely horrible or absolutely amazing
I love Johnny Depp not this kid who doesnt sing 
""
Again Chalamet There are no other actors
its a let down to see that this film could not at least employ a dwarf to play the umpa loopa why use Hugh grant  superimposed badly onto a smaller figure  did they run out of money
Gee I wonder if any of the comments here were paid for by WB
is that lil mabu
Another unnecessary background story whose only purpoise is make more money out of an original idea Explain how Willy Wonka became himself is actually a way of killing him Youre actually killing the mystery and the fantasy about his background all at once And what an awful acting is that
Excellent trailer Im already looking forward to seeing that movie and it seems that its chocolates and sweets will taste like Oscar
dull and generic
Timothee Chalamet is becoming the new Johnny Depp
I still like like johnny depp in it
Im offended that Wonka is not performed by a black transgender
Johnny Depps as wonka is real good its hard to beat that
Finally with this and snowpiercer the trilogy is done
AYO THATS THE GUY FROM HORRIBLE HISTORIES
Wait Mr bean also in there
"142 Rowan Atkinson cameo 
Alright I am watching this"
Anyone else is gonna rewatch the Mr beasts video where he build a Willy Wonka chocolate factory in real life  
I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good
WOW Ashoka looks great
Ahh I miss this franchise so much
oh i loooove timmy finally getting to be overtly silly for this role i see the vision
these days only cartoon movies 
Chocolateis a serious businessXD
"the big question is
whould Roald Dahl have approved of this idea
as he despised the 1971 version that is why no other film version was made while he was alive the 1971 version ruined his story
but according to his family he whould have loved the 2005 version
also seeing a radioactive carrot person as an Oompa Loompa instead of an tiny humans from the rainforest is just wrong"
Doesnt look like the good old willy we knew Well see nevertheless
Best part of this whole trailer 0205
I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary But I gotta admit this looks quite good And Timothee is very talented
Imactually okay with the idea of this Maybe its using the original motif in the score maybe its the idea that a whimsical approach with a supporting cast to distract from Chalamets overthetop voice could make this work but Im down to see this
Why
Gene Wilder would be proud
lil bro acting like Floop in Spy Kids 1
Mr Bean
I would make the joke If the WB network made a Willy Wonka remake buttttt this is literally that
Not Johnny Depp as willy wonka
AWESOME
I dont like my childhood memories being played with but Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa does intrigue me Big sigh
Its exploring parts of the book we only ever hear about and I daresay hes channeling Gene Wilder as well LOVE IT
MrBean run away 
Only Johnny depp suits wonka
"               Wonka
     "
Im here for the chocolate Willy Wonka but most importantly Mathew Baynton and Simon Farnaby
Se nota que atacarn a la religin mnimo
Ah Our favorite colonizer has returned
Ugh pass
""
This looks delightful
Im sorry I dont bye Timothee as wonka
Looks like Warner Bros has adopted Timothee Chalamet No complaints Good cast 
Why am I crying
Looks really good and interesting If the reviews are positive sounds like it will be an amazing movie Timothee has the carrer Tom Holland dreams of The trick is Holland You try to find parts that will challenge you and not thinking you are the great action hero and doing a mediocre Uncharted As long as you dont understand that you wont ever outgrow SpiderMan
Lol charlies a black girl now
Looks really entertaining would be nice to see how it all started for Willy Wonka
PERFECT Casting 
Willy Wonka is an emotionI love and respect him soooooo muchand for meMr Johny Depp is the best Wonka in this world but I love Timotheeafter Mr Depp hes the 2nd best Wonka Gooooooo TimGod bless you and the entire team of Wonka
The perfect actor for this
aint no way that Wonka shop goes to Kylie
This is gonna be cute
way too much fake CG More weird like Tim Burtons Alice in Wonderland than the true silver screen magic of Padington or original Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Another Willy Wonka movie First theres Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 1971 then there was Charlie and the Chocolate Factory then Tom  Jerry and now this
whoever said olivia coleman never turns down a script was so right 
Terrible casting for Wonka
Meh
Timothee is gonna make Gene proud
Another remake No new ideas for years now
Timothee Chalamet is awesome  one of my fav actors
whats with the accents where is this film based lol
I would expect spice melange flavoured chocolate then
Im going to just say it  hes not right for the role  its so cringe but maybe thats how they wanted him to play it
I didnt know lil mabu s twin was an actor
Still cant beat Depps performance this isnt even close
This willy wonka is different from the one portrayed by deppbut lets wait 
I would pay for see Johnny Depp as Mr Wonka but that never will possible because clearly 18 years have been passed now from the secuel film in 2005 and he is now lot more older but with AI can be possible restore his youngerhood beauty and physicalsexual attractive in his face and body
039 I would have a life sentence bc Im always daydreaming
Eh
I initially wanted to watch this because of Timothee Chalamet the production photos looked great But finally seeing this trailer excites me to watch it even more I cannot wait to see this in theaters after watching Dune 2 in theaters as well of course It looks so magical fun and whimsical 3
"Rowan Atkinson in the confession and Once weve started dancing we cant stop turns around and bends over 
Also Im going to have to eat something sweet and tasty or this movie will torment me"
thanks i hate it
Cant wait for this CHOCOLATY EXPERIENCE 
No Dady dreaming
Every record has been destroyed or falsified every book rewritten every picture has been repainted every statue and street building has been renamed every date has been altered And the process is continuing day by day and minute by minute History has stopped Nothing exists except an endless present in which the Party is always right  George Orwell 1984 Stop the woke censorship
great trailer but timothees acting is not it in this trailer it feels like hes forcing himself to play willy other cast are great but timothee didnt pull of that magic you know
Dang really cant wait for another prequel of Snowpiercer
He has the look but I dont think he has the charisma to pull off the character like Gene Wilder I dont see the same unpredictable zaniness that typified  Genes portrayal
LOL i wonder if boba fett makes a cameo
Babe wake up Wonka origin story just dropped
Grew up with Gene Wilder as Wonka Loved the Wonka gag in the 2000s The world needs Wonka especially now
He fits in this far better than the lead of Dune
Well this looks mediocre
Im already loving this since I saw Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory when I was 6
how do you not realize how awful this looks
THIS THIS IS WHAT I WANT FROM YOU DISNEY Not princess stories BACKGROUMD CHARACTERS WE ABSOLUTELY LOVE stories 
So a prequel better than a remakeagain
timothy charlatan truly one of the least charismatic actors this decade perhaps i need him and his square jaw to get OUT
omg its horrible histories guy
Looks terrible This will bomb hard
Hopefully this movie doesnt flop
     
This looks fun  I think we can all use some happiness
This guy might not look very much like the original in young but his acting looks promising
Rowan Atkinson is in okay Im sold
Here we go mama
Cringe af
timmothe is so miscast has no comedic timing like DEPP its going to be a BORE
Ugh
Trash
The trilogy is complete
140 Thats was unexpected to see Mr Bean appearance in this movie 
Nostalgic 
On paper nothing about this should work so why did this trailer make me so happy
Roald Dahl the man who wrote Charlie and the Chocolate Factory has been censored by the publishing company Puffin George Orwell  another famous British author warned of the dangers of rewriting books movies and history End the woke madness
Brace yourselves all the White Crystal worshiper ladies  are coming
finally the Jonka movie
WHATT
I feel Gene Wilder smiling
finally
vibes disney but its Warner Bros 
This Wonka looks and acts like Daniel Thrasher the piano guy from YouTube and Facebook
Nope
Yeah Willi Wonka without Johnny depp  yeah Uh huh umm hmm okay
What a legacy to have movies made even today on your childrens books
I cant wait for the post credit scene of Charlie being born
Remember when people had original ideas instead of remaking the same story every 510 years
get ready for willy wonka 2
I did it
This looks looks a feelgood movie which this year really needs And plus THERES ROWAN ATKINSON
yah beda cerita sm yg dulu ya
Though not related to both the original Willy Wonka movie and the Tim Burtons 2005 remake this looks very sweet magical and charming
Timothee Chalamet does not fit this role His acting took me right out of the magic of this trailer
""
The Willy Wonka movie we never knew we needed
I do not like Timothy Chalamet
okay
People seemingly and unanimously hated on Johnny Depps portrayal at release Heath Ledger as Joker Robert Pattinson as Batman  always good to give actors a chance
magical
something is so of
WHY WHY WHY WHY 
Who up wonking they willy rn
Seriously Another Wonka movie just to add the precious representation
Directed and written by the man who made paddington Its gonna be a masterpiece
Is this a prequel to how Willy Wanka got his start that wiuld lead into a movie like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory
Rowan Atkinson Im in
This looks bland
Ill be taking this as a prequel to the first movie and not the remake seeing that the Oompa Loompa is well orange
Honest question i never got a chance to try a wonka bar Was it good
Didnt even feel like 227 minutes
hahahahahahhahahahahahahahha
Wow this looks bad
Ugh
Timothee went from being Paul Atreides to Willy Wonka in one year is just amazing
That looks boring
I see Timothee Chalamet I go see the movie
Cool
too many black people
This looks awesome But please just make something new
Interesting 
This is the most beautiful trailer I have ever seen I absolutely love Timothee chalamet as willy Wonka
When something looks this much like a ridiculous pointless flop in the trailer you just know the film itself is going to be a special kind of garbage
I dont know how I feel about CGI oompa loopa
Wish we would have gotten a continuation of the story with Charlie running the factory using the original cast not another reboot thats gonna change stuff
oh my god whattt This is going to be interesting
Soooo unnecessary
They went woke with this casting black supporting actors who wouldnt be around in this timeline Other than that it looks pretty good
This looks like Timothe is doing a cookie Johnny Depp impressionWhy isn t this a prequel to Gene Wilder s version of the character  This is just goofy without any spark of sarcasm intelligence or wit
Wow that looks awful
Omg the hype is real
"Another Male Actor with 2 Huge Projects coming out in one Year with no Female Accusations whatsoever Well Somethings about to Change

Johnny Depp and Jonathan Majors"
Willy Wokea
another woke movie no one asked for
Who asked for the story of Willy Wonka  We dont want to know the origins of Willy Wonka or how much he struggled to start his factory I was bored and sleepy watching this trailer And I just woke up
So many black people because its a woke film
Ohoo  realy  thanks for  bring back old memories  
I cant see Timy as Willy I see Timmy wearing a costume of Willy Wonka you know what I mean
Looks good wonka
No one can replace Johnny deep
The movie seems really really good better than I expected but Timothe Chalamet playing Wonka I just dont see it like the voice the narration it really doesnt work for me I hope Ill forget about it while watching it but I wish they wouldve look for others actors maybe
 Chocolate cartel   wtf
Nice to see a movie studio taking an original movie and milking it I can already see where this is going
Cant wait to watch the origin story of a man who wants to drug everybody and make them obese Whats with Hollywood and unnecessary origin stories Willy Wonka is much better from the Charlies perspective where Wonka is mysterious scary where youre intrigued whats in the factory then you find out everything out No one wants to see how he comes up with recipes and becomes rich
Too late Ive started dancing and once weve started dancing we cant stop 
This looks cheesy but the oompa loompa got me
"205
Wonka So youre the funny little man whos been following me
Oompa Loompa I will have you know that I am a perfectly respectable size for an Oompa Loompa
Wonka An Oompa what now
Oompa Loompa Allow me to refresh your memory
215
Wonka Oh I dont think want to hear that
Oompa Loompa Too late Ive started dancing now Once we start we cant stop"
million views in an hour 
Why
Snowpiercer prequel has finally arrived
Was not fully interested  until I saw Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompa  Now a must see
As a Charlie and the choclate factory fan I cant wait to see this 
This gives a lot of Dolittle vibes but if it was better in every way Cant wait to see it
Bro went from Muadib to Wonka
he is not perfecting chocolate he is perfecting cringe
Looks great 
Remind me Jonny
MR CARSON from Downton Abbey  Im so happy to see Jim Carter in such a big film  Im probably more excited for him than anyone else lol
Omg So excited about this Seeing Rowan in this film is just pure joy
139 love to see Mr Bean 
At first I was like meh then you showed me Hugh Grant as an oompa lumpa Now Im all a board
Who up wonking they willys rn 
Mr Bean and Willy Wonka Yesss
"Willy wonka 
Lets gooooo"
Maaaaaaan I aint even gonna hate I was sold in the first 10 seconds This genuinely looks like a great movie
Timothy is simply incapable of frivolity What a dead middleschool performance
Im so excited to watch this movie Willy Wonka movies are so exciting to watch for the whole family
Perfect character selection 
""
""
Im hungry for candy
nice to see Danial Thrasher step up in his acting career
Oh look Hollywood making something to distract us from the fact they were exposed for exploiting children and trafficking Nice try
Wonkas Youth That is impressive because he is an adult in Charlies movie
I guess chocolate is one way to cope with spice addiction
Since I watched the 2005 movie I have been THE BIGGEST FAN OF WILLY WONKA and everyday would wait for the trailer of the 2023 WONKA omg I AM SOOOO HYPED I SWEAR 
"Now the only question I have is if this is a prequel to the 70s version or 2000s but love this

103 IS THAT MR BEAN"
Timmy is so checked out in this role he does not care at all 
it looks like fantastic beasts and gives off the greatest showman
Couldnt even finish the trailer Embarrassingly bad
Starring the giraffe from Hangover 3 141
If I had to make this film I would have just ripped off perfume 
Cant wait
Wow I really like this wonka
The Johnny Depp film was bad enough and now this Theres only one Willy Wonka and his name is Gene Wilder
Timothee is goodNo Doubt But I badly miss Johnny Depp when his characters come again on screens
Lame I thought it was based on the reboot I wanted headgear papa and tribal oompa loompas He is doing the Depp voice tho
wait this got me so excited for christmas already and its june rn 
His acting is terrible Literally Disney channel level of acting  
una caca
039 Man thats strict
Im crying
Mr Bean as a priest Sign me up
Idk
Timothee Chalmet and Rowan Atkinson together Thats the craziest thing Ive ever seen
"Special request Can commenters please just stop using the didnt know I needed hyperbole 

Reason being Its really draining the culture to be so reliant on memes not to mention being so clearly ignorant about what one needs No one needs Rowan Atkinson no offense to the actor 

Suggestion If offering feedback come up with something original to say"
This is woke propaganda that the left is pushing to promote transgender to our children
God Almighty Hollywood is DEAD Same stories  Remade The actor from Hulu wouldve been great as Wonka

"WTF is this where the chocolate factory and fat kids chowing on chocolate
Terrible choice for Wonka"
Wasnt 2 enough
that looks legit
Fantastic beasts but with chocolate
I have questions about Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa and Im afraid that I wont find answers
An American Willy Wonka
Maybe its just me but I think this just takes the magic out of the mystery and allure around Wonka Personally I just dont think its a story that needs telling
Ughhh
this seems goofy cant wait
Gives me Wonka origins feeling
They were waiting for timothee to grow up for this role Perfect
It would be great if Warner Brothers did a remake of the Quest for Camelot 1998 The Snow Queen 1999 Fearless Four 1997 and The Wizard of Oz 1939
Is the chocolate named Wonkas Whipple Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight  
always a treat seeing Rowan Atkinson no matter how big the role
Sorynot a fan of choco flavor spice
Rowan Atkinson 
O M G this Prequel PELASE BE GOOD and this just confirms that Tim burtons verison is well a total mess
So Is this a prequel to Johnny Depps Willy Wonka or Gene Wilders versions
"Dune boy didnt do enough research character building to follow Wilder America always use crappy puns whipped cream  its not clever Wonka originally balanced self contradictive statements like balancing sweet and sour weilded paradoxes like cloth topped it off with a sprinkle of effortlessness couldnt even fall over if he tried  
IAM good    too good "
who thought this was a good idea
Willywog
It looks so good
I cantt wait The cast is insane My jaw was on the floor throughout the video Timothee has an extraordinary career going on
oh god seeing mr bean instantly put a smile on my face
"As optimistic as I could be about this film I just have this sinking feeling that its not going to live up to expectations 

Weve been burned badly by Hollywood a lot the last 7 years 

Trying to fill the shoes of Gene Wilder the best actor to ever put on the Wonka hat is a near impossible task at best

 Sorry Johnny Depp but your version doesnt count"
Harry Potter Fantastical Beasts Netflixs Unfortunate events Tim Burtons Wonka this NEW Wonka etc They all seem like the same reality is there a name for this genre
Big pass This story in general has too many subliminals to name
And the next massive flop will be 
Fantastical
No thanks
I always admired Timothees work and it brings my heart joy to see him do the role of one of my beloved childhood classics 3 I cant wait to see this
I dont even care for Timothee but he somehow works perfect here
WB seem to love Timothe rn He is very talented hoping for this to be good and Dune p2
Eh idk about this one
I  now lived enough to see Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
Mat baynton my beloved
Im literally going to see this just because of Hugh grant as an oompaloompa 
"Every good thing in this world started with a dream so you hold onto yours 
Thankyou for my new favourite quote"
Why the heck is Hugh Grant an umpa  Loompa like I cant omg 
YAY
This looks really bad sorry Chalamet isnt a good actor Atleast the burton remake had a different take
Charlie and the chocolate factory 
"i was not looking forward to this at all kind of hate the idea of it existing especially after the terrible Depp film

i love the OG film one of my all time favourites

but then i started during the trailer getting Paddington vibesand then it said the same director Paddington 1  2 so i am sold on it now it looks really fun"
"Ooh I got chills

Roald Dahl Rowan Atkinson Hugh Grant Olivia Colman and Matt Lucas  a soontobe Christmas classic no doubt"
I love the old one but will see this and enjoy it too cos its different
This will work
the Chocolate Cartel lmfaoooo 
Why are they turning American classics to the UK
Idk bruh Im not digging Timothy Charlemagne as Wonka
Charlie and the chocolate factory was my favorite book as a kid Im definitely excited to see this movie being made
"WW
Willy wanka
Walter white "
thr forced comedy is killing me bro
I didnt think I needed it until I saw it
"But elijah wood exists disappointed 
The kids these days are trash actors"
How much did he snort that sand
Good lord can people make something original
Bruh who tf asked
timothe captures wonkas energy so well from this trailer alone
In the meantime that worthless Grandpa Joe continues to lay about in bed
Im in
WANKA
Dune et Wonka et CHALAMET 
This guy is going to be the hottest male lead for the next two or three decades Hes talented enough to pull it off
I remember the days when disney used to make movies like this such a shame they chose to go woke over keeping the magic for kids
Im an absolute fan of timothee chalamet and I cant wait to see him portray Wonka Super excited for this film
so many good movies coming this year
Well this just looks so good 
Trash Johnny Depp is Willy Wonka This is trash
I love the part where Rey says shes a Skywalker So bold so brave
this timothy dude should be blacklisted from movies forever he cant act
Looks absolutely magical
Im not sure I can see timothee as Wonka he doesnt rly have that unhinged vibe  but we shall see I might very well be wrong
is he selling drugs 
Why
"I have to admit it even I want to see it after all the moaning Ive done about modern films
Please dont be woke please dont be woke please dont be woke"
I wasnt expecting to be dazzled and delighted by a Wonka trailer this morning yet here we are
Idk if the humor of this is doing it for me
Gene wilder  Im the willy wonka 
why is willy wonka southern
Its funny how Hollywood wants to cast this guy in everything
THIS LOOKS ABSOLUTELY AMAZING IM DEFINITLEY GOING TO GO SEE IT
Willy wonka chocolate mrbeast chocolate
I love the fact that he uses One of Wonkas  famous lines from the Original classic Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory scratch that reverse it
The only madinventor movie on my mustsee list  Sorry Mr Nolan
Not me crying 
People are forgetting the original movie exists Everyones talking about Johnny Depps version Look at the Oompa Loompa Its clearly from the 1971 version And you can hear Pure Imagination in the trailer Thats from the original movie too This is not a prequel to the Johnny Depp movie people
Timothee Clam as Wonka In what world is that
Pls dont let it be a musical
They gave Wonka a White Savior subplot and called it diversity lol Anyway Chalamet looks to be in good form here
The chocolate cartel 
Well I was smiling all the way up until 206 caught me off guard
When Timothy was cast as Willy Wonka I doubted anyone will be able to recreate Depps magic but this looks promising
This the nun 2 and the Meg 2 I literally didnt expect a sequel fir these at all and we dont even need them
MATHEW BAYNTON MATHEW BAYNTON
I dont think so 
We love similar movies I really liked Mr Bean character
OOMPA LOOMPA
Many of us didnt expect for the movie to turn out like this but here we are looks good and interesting Im definitely gonna go see it on day 1 thats for sure
MATTHEW BAYNTON AND ROWAN ATKINSON IN THE SAME FILM Im so there
Hugh Grant playing an Oompa Loompa  he really hit the bottom of the barrel but I still cant wait to see it
omg is this gonna be a musical im in
I see Mr Rowan 
"THE MUSIC IS SO EPIC
I WOULD DEFINITELY WATCH THIS MOVIE "
I  have a bad feelings  about this  feel  uts gonna be woke
Damn it Im in
Looking forward to it
We have Johnston Charles the II and Dafydd from Little Britain all in one film
bruhhh this look so bad lmao and also whats up with the top comments they sound like bots
Oh dear
I thought it was Danielthrasher
Paul Atreides making chocolates
How many remakes have to come out of Hollywood They have no originality any more
he should have used a high voice in his performance
Not impressed 
Visually this looks alright but alas I am spoiled on the Gene Wilder portrayal of Wonka He played an eccentric mysterious dark and  friendly madman all too well and Chalemet just seems too straight laced in this version
2023 ITS GIVING US MOOOVIES
OMG is that the highway man guy from horrible histories Mathew John Bayten
Looks more wilder than depp and I love depp just not his wonka
You ruinned you ruinned and i leaving
Im just asking you After charlie and the chocolate factory and johnny depp do you think this movie is okay What is this after Johnnys wonka character its youth It has nothing to do with the character of Wonka You made a movie about the story of a boy who loves chocolate Congratulations
Its only Alan Johnson Good to see him back on the screen
Wait wasnt Wonkas father a dentist Wheres he
Thank goodness Willy winks isnt race swapped gender identity spitting political pandering loser like every other film coming out now This actually looks really fun and good I might actually take my family to the movies to see this 
HUGH GRANT IS AN OOMPA LOOMPA 
Interesting curiosity peaked
Immer diese moralischen Botschaften am Ende jedes Trailers  Ein Film den wir nicht gebraucht haben Und es kommt nicht an den Charm des 1 Films heran
Looks like this movie is totally missing the Dahl edge His books always had a dark humor to them I dont see that in the trailer sadly
Why do we need another Wonka movie Money is why 
Lies of P the movie
Lisan algaib
are we already living in a time when the AI overlords have taken over and decided that every movie should start this chalamet guy
That movie featuring Johnny Depp was better
Excited for this one The plot looks quite interesting
Im only going to see this to watch Rowan Atkinson scream Run Away
Looks much better than the Depp version
I am totally bought when I saw Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa Take my money
How is this different from Johnny Depps version
not that this ever needed a prequel but Ryan Gosling was right there COME ON
Wanted a cameo with Johnny Depp
Its make me laugh when i saw mrbeam
Ahhhhhh Willy Wonka  I want to be his apprentice 
Didnt even come close to JOHNNY
Timothe Chalamet doesnt feel eccentric enough to be Wonka Hes too grounded
The Willy Wonka movie we never knew we needed but now absolutely need to watch Nuff said
This guy should play luffy
Billions of true stories and they make a wonka prequel Give us better stories You can tell Hollywood writers are on strike or deserve to be paid trash for writing this
"Why  cast some  baby face guy as Wonka
But I guess Mr Bean balances that out"
Yay more destruction of literature for one sided political agenda Yay Creating new properties is just too hard More hand me downs I guess
The Harry Potter logo makes its more interesting 
THIS THIS IS MY JOKER
I love Timothee but he just seems like hes trying too hard I guess well have to wait and see
Dear god the whimsy the wonder
The films logo Wongaka is quite similar to Thai alphabet  Padahon but its mean nothing 
Looks good
""
Man this looks fun and cute
At least wonka is still the same color
101 AINT NO WAY ITS THE GOAT MR BEAN HIMSELF
Oh so thats dance from The Love Actually was a rehearsal love it for Hugh Grant 
After being unable to prevent the mass genocide in his name Paul Atreides time traveled to a simpler time to restart his life as a business man
this looks good
Timothe Chalamet really manages to capture both Johnny Depp and Gene Wilders excentric behaviour
Interesting
Damn this is magical I cant wait to see it
Restore the Snyder verse
mehCillianLeo got nothing to worry about this award season
Wow so instead of the typical Charlie  the chocolate factory we get a deep back story of Willy this time obviously this was long overdue This looks pretty damn nice definitely gotta get me a chocolate almond hersey if I go see this
What country is this set in
getting Goosebumps while watching this trailer
Waiting for it
Looks amazing
Johnny Depp looks really young here
PLEASE make something that will teach us a valuable lesson instead of giving us nightmares 
Just tell me how he makes the scary tunnel
Honest opinion Johnny Depp plays the role SO much better
wellmmm dont ask me
I always thought of Timothee being a second Johnny Depp
I like how Timothee channels a lot of Gene Wilders energy while still making it his own take of the character His performance will definitely be a standout for this film
How many times they gonna make this movie common 
ANITHER ONE OMMGMGGGG
Hes too young to play Willy wtf
THI
Gene Wilder is smiling from heaven right now RIP 
Wow A very different take I like it
"Was waiting for the creepy accoustic cover of Pure Imagination to show up like all the trailers like this

And there it is at the 004 mark"
This doesnt look good
Wow they couldnt have chosen a better Willy Wonka I saw and heard a lot of Johnny Depp mannerisms who played Wonka in the remake Excellent casting choice and I cant wait to see it 
Its just Harry Potter with candy
At least theyre acknowledging that the 1971 Gene Wilder version is the one to base it
Wow
I was curious Now Im excited  1215 lets go WonkaVision like Mike Teevee
That kid doesnt look or act anything like Willy Wonka to me Hugh Grant would have been a better Wonka
the lies of P prequel looks amazing
141 was that Mr Bean
Someone please deepfake Timothys face with Daniel Thrasher
Yeah  hes a good actor but Im really not feeling this movie
Does everything and everyone need a origin story
Chalamet is a good actor but I just dont see it Wilder and Depp although vastly different Wonkas were so magical in their roles it is hard to imagine anyone coming close to their excellence I am happy to see this is seemingly more of an origin story though
Looks interesting The black girl is diversity casting
Not up to the level Johnny depp has marked
Rowan atkinson  ok im sold
"The magic moments the sudden insight the closeup on silly faces followed by quick cuts of theatrically dismayed costars the absurd wokeness the PC XTC the whispered dialogue so you know they are priceless epiphanies the random fanfare fillers as camera pans over incredible landscapescities the suddenly choreographed crowds followed by instant harmless puns ideated by 8 year olds the celebrity cameosalright move along nothing to see here its just a bunch of mediocre CGI
I know I know  I could just avoid the movie
But then again the trailer forced me here
Hats off to the WB marketing ensuring the unfiltered adulation comments were here first"
"Why bother making new films when you can milk an existing IP Isnt that your always your approach Warner Bros
Please think of something original"
I like that they arent copying the other two  films made and trying something new I think weve all wanted an in depth back story too Willy Wonka and this is going to be excellent
F this no Jhonny no money Aint watching
When Paul MuadDib Atreides conquered the known universe he needed a new challenge And thus the Wonka Chocolate Factory
This is gonna be magical  love from India 
Looks pretty good overall but Timothe Chalamet looks a bit too overly jovial to play Wonka in a convincing way
This will bomb horribly
the legend that is Matthew Bayton has once again graced us with his presence
Still think he should be cast in a Syd Barrett biopic
Wilder and Depp gave this weird onthevergeunhinged insanitycreative charisma to Wonka that made him a memorable character Tim just does not give that same vibe 
Tuff
Diversity Quota 
I legit teared up when the orchestral version of Pure Imagination swelled My God its beautiful
This trailer killed all the excitement I had for this film I loved previous Wonka films and I think Timothe Chalamet is an excellent actor but his performance seems somehow off and forced as this character Theres also a problem with the tone they are going for Wonka is supposed to be a complex unpredictable and sometimes scary character This trailer is overly sweet with none of the bitterness any good chocolate should have
I only remember seeing Johnny depp as wonka
We know rowan atkinson even with just a split second screen time
This looks pretty good
Chalamet looks like hes having more fun here than his last four movies combined
It doesnt need to exist
I was just wondering the other day about when the Wonka movie was going to be released and Im so happy that we finally got a trailer Im excited for this movie 
Something different for Wonka Love it Cant wait to see it
    
hes got the personality of a Disney kid actor 0 of me wanted him as willy wonka 100 of me didnt want another Willy wonka Will be bad
Why does it remember me the maad hatter from alice
Johnny depp as Willy Wonka no one can replace him
Woah was not expecting this
Make new movies There must be great scripts out there waiting for a chance
I know for sure that the movie is gonna be hella good but the trailer doesnt do it Justice
Starring Timothy Chalamet playing as Johnny Depp
So the ending of this trailer implies that Wonka is SPECIFICALLY a prequel to the 1970s Gene Wilder movie then Thats fun
Johnny Depp 
"Disney Meets the Wizarding World
Timothee Chalamet incarnated as Willy Wonka is impressive and Im so much excited for this The magical grandeur fancy dances colourful embroidery and the Wonkas origin story has amazed me Director Paul King has yet again crafted a gem like Paddington 1  2 Exploring Willys journey while OompaLoompas making a part in this new original story Trailer has gifted a splendid yet magically crafted a candy makers journey"
Cringe
You had me at Rowan Atkinson that man is a living legend
""
no one can replace Johnny Depp
Ok i thought this would be cringe when I first heard about it but I think this could be good
Did he really give Wonka a hayseed accent
"I thought this would be a remake again At the beginning I thought Nah this cant beat those 2 
But a prequel thats new and Im really curious what the song sounds like"
Yeah no as soon as I saw from the producer of harry potter I tuned out Im not supporting that witch
Finally an excuse to head to theatres again
"If Timothee Chalamet manages to enthrall the audience in this type of films then theres no stopping him
You need a certain edge to play a character as fantastical and whimsical as Willy Wonka"
no
Something I never knew I needed in life
didnt expect to see hugh grant as an oompa loompa but here we are
"How many POC will we employ to meet our DEI
WB Yes
Seriously rich POC in post war London Lol"
I cant help myself but Willy Wonka without Jonny Depp is idk
"Wow Im usually always on board for everything even just a little bit because I love movies in general and I actually love Timothee Chalamet I have a bunch of his movies But this trailer left me with this sinking feeling in my chest Idk how to describe it except for what does Gen Z say this looks trash

And I loved the new Little Mermaid"
Finally A perfect Christmas movie after a long time
""
This is something Ive been wanting forever Im so excited
That guy looks like he has his pronounce on instagram page
Is that MrBean  OK I am in Looks exciting
So was it intentional Wonkas probably girlfriend would have a chocolate complexion
Is that Alan Johnson wtf 
This looks sick And the director is the one from Paddington I dont need anything more I want to watch this
MR BEAN
""
In the first few seconds Im not quite sure about this one but when I watched the whole trailer it seems more than worth to watch Congrats in advance my Timothe Chalamet 
Honestly I am quite impressed with this trailer It piqued my interest Willy Wonka still holds a special place in m my childhood
This looks terrible
Nothing ever original anymore 2020s recipe remake something but add woke ingredients Hopefully Im wrong for this one but odds arent good
ngl im gunna watch this so much
Looks Mid
No just no man
Timothy Chalamet is giving me some Daniel Thrasher vibes in this trailer and that gives me hope
So wheres the part where he creates the Eternal Engine and launches a giant ark train around the world
Im addicted to chocolate because of the book and movies and now I am gonna relapse
Timothee has the charisma of a teaspoon but Hugh Grant cracked me up That man has charisma for the both of them  the movie looks amazing Ill endure Timothee to enjoy this one I like Timothee but this is not his best role He doesnt look engaging at all But that could change in the runtime but from the trailer not convinced
Yoooooo is that mf mr bean
Everyone gonna like it cuz ooh it has a young hot actor woooaah
This makes me realized how difficult acting actually is His acting and Johnny Depps are too far apart
No one tell Little Joel about this
So much poor quality VFX It taking away all the magic theyre trying to convey
Oompa loompa was damn funny 
Love the original not ready for a Hollywood remake just yet Why
Im good Already looks woke and to dark for me
Willy Wonka Charly and the cholate factory sequel the owner of the cholate factory
its perfect its actually perfect
The worst movie trailer i have ever seen
This looks kinda corny ngl Im still gonna watch AND like it but
Timothee Chalamet 
THAT AINT WILLY WONKA THATS WILLIAM WACOM
looks like woke garbage lol going to bomb fantastically
Did anyone see mr bean
The one thing that made the first movie so good is there were no black people
GOOFY
This looks so delightful
Never expected a prequel to such a classic film
is that Rowan Atkinson
Its averaging over 100k views per 10 min
"And youre still never gonna adapt the actual Wonka sequel I wonder why
Maybe stop milking old properties and create something original"
Ive mixed reaction The two moments when Ive smiled were the priest running and the oompa loompa singing I dont like the breathy talking at all it distracts me too much from the story itself It makes me think that the characters suffer from asthma and are about to suffer a stroke
Now we have Willy Wonka backstory too 
This trailer filled me with childish Joy If they succeed and still respecting Gene his legacy Then i would definitely try to watch it when it comes  out  sorry JD Gene was and still is the only real oneBut you already knew this 
Nice 
All I hope for at this point is that there is more of a character arc for Wonka If its just Timothy throwing eccentric looks around character actors and CGI its not gonna be enough to carry the movie It looks promising but for me I will want more than just an actor acting silly for two hours
Me thinks wonka number 2in the works
"looks way too Artificial it insist to be extremely Epic and Magical
but it just made me roll my eyes

does anyone realy care for Wonkas back story"
ROVAN ATIKONSON HOLY SHEEEEEEET
I know its petty but the American accents ruin this for me 
Its gonna be a masterpiece  absolutely loved it
Looks like a train wreck cant wait for it to flop 
No more Ideas in Hollywood Lets just keep remaking movies I dont waste my money
Stop remaking movies
Its like Disney movie but without cameo fest that burns your eyes
I loved it when willy wonka said  we didnt lose the chocolate war we wonk  it and proceeded to wonk his willy Truly a moment of this trailer
""
No one wants this
not interested  not a fan of WOnker films anyway this guy should be given the chance to try out for Doctor Who  I think he would do good
No Johnny no Wonka
I spy Mat Baynton
That looks pretty bad Suspecion of disbelieve was shattered almost immediatelly
If Im HONEST I predict Timothy Chalamet performance as Wonka will be better than the actual movie tbh But we will see
I have no desire to watch this movie but I really really appreciate the fact that this trailer doesnt start with a 5 second mini trailer and feature some girl singing Pure Imagination with vocal fry
Timmy future oscar winner his role selection is 1010
i love  Timothe Chalamet but he is not good for this character who knows he may surprise us
They actually got the classic oompa loompa look right something the last movie failed to do 
Its meh
NUH UH
Grandpa Joe is a scumbag
It feels weird to see an ethnically diverse Willy Wonka movie Its like were in an alternate universe
I cant imagine anyone as wonka other than depp
Is there a CGI animators strike going on that I dont know about
No just no absolutely not
As someone who read the book and saw the original film Im super excited for this 
Wow It feels like a new CATCF movie Im gonna see but better
141 Rowan Atkinson
I wonder if well get to see how Wonka met Mr Wilkinson
for rowan atkinson
Puts smile on my face  oh how exciting
why did they cast timmothy chalomet for this movie what were they thinking
Ohh brilliant brilliant this is brilliant
Wooooooo
I m loving it Mr Wonka 
Its been way too long since the last time weve had a whimsical movie being released around Christmas This is something we could really use Normally origin movies are meh at best and dont always succeed in the box office but we have a story telling about how everyones favorite decades old chocolatier came to be Tim Burtons Charlie and the Chocolate Factory was way more faithful to the novels but only dipped into the past like how he met the Oopma Loompa tribe and nothing else By the look of things Wonka will be giving fans a full tour of how he came to be Cant wait
Omg
I wouldnt say this looks good but it looks interesting  I hate how all these movies look like a glitter explosion  There also seems to be alot of call backs and nostalgia to the Gene Wilder version  I understand that Wilder is the standard but I like to see some more originality  Just because it was a catchy line in the first movie doesnt mean you have to repeat it  Im not as excited as others here but at least nothing can tarnish the magic of the original as Gene Wilder will always be my Wonka
The guy from Dune is now willy wonka without a shop Ever watched Guy Pierce films My life  wonka didnt have a shop he had a factory and Hugh Laurie will serve me like Santas elf for goodness sake 
He who controls the chocolate controls the universe
no daydreaming  
hmm i dont know why everyone is so hype about this movie For me i dont really see willy wonka vibe in this movie But its just a trailer so hope the movie will show us better
Who is Hugh Grant
Oh wait they ruined it Wheres jhonny depp and the stereotypes came back
The woke wanka 
i didnt know what to expect from this film but it looks really funny
They could have made a movie called Wanka and Mark Ruffalo could have played himself
GRATE ENGENUATAY
This looks wonderful I cant wait
timothee nasil bu kadar guzel bir oyuncu olabiliyor ya 
Okay the 1970s movie was silly but down to earth This just looks super childish
Stop  Just stop  Get somebody who has an originalgoddam idea and hire them Stop remaking remakes over and over you no talent hacks
Oh this looks fun
This looks really good cant wait to see it
producer of harry potter
After the flash fail in the box office WB really need a W if not BARBIE then Willy Wonka
OK  This just might be Good 
What if Peter Ostrum played a young Grandpa Joe in this it would really go full circle
I was literally thinking of Wonka 
" 
   
 "
Ya la quiero ver
The trend of creatively bankrupt rehashes continues I do like the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa though
I hope it does not go tooo much against Roald Dahls orginal  vision for Willy Wonka
WTFF
Disappointed But hey its got those diversity quotas met Which is the main thing  The story itself looks very childish I know its a kids movie but it could have some better wit to it Looks boring overly soppy and Wonka seems to be played without the wit or mischief the original had The only saving grace is Hugh Grant though I doubt he can save this
128 So theyve made Hitler ginger
Who up wonking they willy rn
Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean casted as Wonka looks incredible
"Id be dirt poor if I had been fined for all the daydreaming Ive done


Also more than 10000 people across the world have watched this in a minute for more than 50 minutes"
Not bad Whats next
I came expecting to be like why do they have to try and remake a classic and ruin it again But I like the story this appears to telling
timothee is fabulous
Ohhhh  This looks good
Why
No shot
Whos the leader of the Chocolate Cartel El Chaco
looks BAD except for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa The rest looks absymal
Okey now im excited thought this would be a 3rd remake at first but i was wrong big time
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Legendary
Hopefully he doesnt make a peach flavoured chocolate
"I dont know it looks pretty dull 
I do like Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompathe rest including the main Wonka actor are meh "
Its Chocolate Time 
Im sorry this looks extremely dumb and the writing is corny
Now that is an oompa loompa Not some weird little indian guy but orange skin and green hair as they should look
Im sorry being honest here this is extremely woke
Johnny depp Is perfect for Willy Wonka
absolutely not
I didnt know i needed this movie until now
hmm love Timmy but does his acting feels like hes acting 
"Do you have an appointment



Oh wrong film"
Ah so this is Fantastic Cocoa Beans And Where To Find Them then Got it
Here we go Mama
Omg its Wonkas backstory 
Finally we learn his origin story
Hollywood has run out of ideas for new movies so they keep remaking the old ones and westerns are the worst finding ways to use Shane to find things to put in their movies
"Going to watch only for Rowan Atkinson
Still cant beat the charm of Previous OG "
""
Oompa Loompas are back
More like Willy Wanka
This looks Amazing just from the Trailer Alone I can see the Beautiful Cinematography
Im ready for the Willy Wonka Into the Wonkaverse Need that Johnny Depp and 2pacd Gene Wilder action
I actually did something I never have done before I fast forward the trailer to the end Thats not good meaning this trailer bored me and I love movies like this Hope the movie is great tho
This is the Joker to Charlie and the chocolate factory s Batman
You know what i am surprisingly excited to see this movie the choice of oompa loompa actor is also quite surprising but i think it will be funny with the english accent lmao
Day one
Course Diverse as always
Wow timothee is actually good
Cant wait to see Timmy the Wonka this December 
Im so glad well see more of willy wonka i mean its been years i need more about him and im so glad this movie is coming out Im so happy who else is
 
""
I had no idea this was a thing and Im excited
OMG
The year of Timothee
Youve got big shoes to fill Tim good luck
Waiting for hindi trailer
hes not weird enough
If there is Rowan Atkinson then it is a much watch
"And yet they find another way to ruin original movies 

there is no reason why this movie should exist"
Looks great 
The Chocolate Cartel 
Dropiado
With how masterful paddington 2 is definitely checking this one out
Wow that looks TERRIBLE
Hopefully they bring back Wonka bars because of this movie
I am sorry but i didnt get crazy insane creepy Willy Wonka vibe that we got from Johnny depp in the chrlie and chocolate factory When they say timothee will play Wonka i thought that it was the best decision But now i am only speaking on trailer its just looks like he is playing as a normal young man without any excitement and surprising features His acting look so boring against the character hes playing
The choose the wrong actor
I love the surrealness of the movie I cant wait
nice
This looks like to wont be good  Compared to previous movies Timothy Chalamet was a terrible pick for this
""
yea im gonna watch this
That films is WONKAtasic butoompa loompa meme did a kracc bacc create a chocolate factory and inventor chocolate remake of willy wonka and the chocolate factoryDO THE HORROR VERSION PLZ
This is so beautiful and I am going to see this in theaters
Heart
okay that seems like a waste
WHY
Awesome cant wait
I see a lot of ireng people
Vaya vamos a ver como va la pelcula
Now do one with Otho from Beetlejuice
Oh wow Timothee twink is killing it
Its going to classic
omaaaguueedddddddds
Definitely better than Depp Well see how close he comes to the original Gene
Skepticalbut Ill give it a shot
So theres the woke culture
Se ve bien y siempre se antoja ver algo interesante en poca navidea
A Willy Wonka prequel series why 
Im so happy that Willy wonka is coming back
Woke 
Whos here for Mr Grant
I like the director and the cast looks great but this looks really unneccesary and a bit underwhelming  Do we really need to know Willy Wonkas back story
You have a responsibility to take care of these people Immediately fires them all for slave labor and becomes a curmudgeon
I wanna be a Legend too 
This actually looks amazing cant wait to watch it
Ok this looks great 
Timothee Chalamet looks like a worthy successor or predecessor of Gene Wilders top hat and I will definitely be seeing this 
I thought his fuzzy lifting stuff was experimental years from then
"I swear Hollywood doesnt have the ability to do anything original or new 
I am just shocked theh havent turned Wonka into a Black Female"
ngl i genuinely thought this was going to be a creepier film  like this was his villain origin story or something  he starts off with a passion for chocolate the trauma from his upbringing  his father in the back of his mind and not completely resolved  and then he gets in deeper and deeper and begins to enslave oompa loompas and starts to put childrens lives in danger but this seems like a very fun family christmas film 
My childhood Well with this my Christmas gonna be special 
I wonder when Hollywood will stop making the same movie over and over
Hiiii carson
"How do you like it White Dark Nutty Absolutely Insane


Me Yes"
Perfect actor for the part of Wonka   I so look forward to this
Im watching the heck out of this come the Christmas months
YESSSSSSSS
Why isnt Wonka black
This is going to be a great movie
No one can replace jhony deep
Why is he so young
yes
Timothee booked and busy this and Dune 2 are both coming out this year
"He looks like Gene Wilder
The best wonka movie"
He remaineds me of Johnny Depp from Charli and the chocolate factory JD all time favourite actor
SO glad they chose Timothe Charlamet instead of Tom Holland No offense to Tom but Timothe is a MUCH better fit for this character and role
I am not feeling this at all very disappointed I had more faith in Timothe to pull something off but this come across as quite boring and mundane
Theres a lot of over a hype here Lets come back down to reality and wait for it to come out
Im sorry all I see is Daniel Thrasher
something for the familythats cute
Danny devito as an oompa luumpa or Im out
This kid isnt a good actor least not in this Its like he is just saying the lines without putting himself in the role Hugh looks funny Love it
They got the right actor for Wonka
Mais il est partout Chalamet D
Im over the same three actors being cast for everything
not a Timothe Chalamet fan but hes going to be great in this
i think this roll would definettely fitt on thimmy like wonkas personality lokks kinda same as themothes personnality                                                   and im extreamelly happy because i cant wait for Dune so this one would come just after one month                                                                              and i just wanna get sure of something cause in this minute150 is thimmy the same littel boy in Badington and he grow up to be Wonka 
I think it would be really interesting to see how he chooses his successor That would make a really interesting movie

This trailer managed to convince me that Willy Wonka did enroll into Hogwarts but he had decided to quit school and become a chocolatier
Sorry this just looks bad
nopehard passHe is not believable for one second as Wonka
It might be good but will it beat Paddington 2
Timothe Chamalet Warner Bros Poster Boy 2023 DUNE 2 a few months before
DID I SEE ROWAN ATKINSON OR AM I TRIPPING
Is no one gonna talk about Mr Bean cameo
Please stop with the remakes nobody will ever be out do Gene Wilder
Of all the Wonka movies out there this is one of them
This looks awfulll
Willy Wonka and the chocolate eye Thx god Ezra Miller is no Wonka this time not that hard to imagine what would he do with them little kids on his factory
Tbh it does look very much like its for kids It could be good but yeah the trailer is giving me catered to a young audience vibe which I guess is what Charlie and the chocolate factory is but lets be honest little kids arent gonna care about a Willy Wonka origin story
""
thats too much fantasy
Johny is johny nobody can replace him
Looks like trash Im sorry
Boy I miss Gene Wilder
Bro in this role just reminds me of Daniel Thrasher but less charismatic
This looks absolutely amazing I cant wait to see this movie 
What the heck Wasnt the original one with a boy Why did they change that character If they wanted to do this version Maybe make Wonka a female of coIor too Warner Brothers should rename their company to W0K3 Brothers This is not original They are swapping characters for their poIiticaI views like Disney did with the Mermaid and Peter Pan which were both fIops
Willy Wonka would be tasked to make chemical weapons for world governments if this was real
Just lovely 
Let this be a prequel to Johnny Depps Willy wonka
Beautiful
This movie shouldve never been made
I am so invested in this movie
If Johnny Depp does not make a cameo I am not watching it
willi wonka and the chocolate factory
Another Mr wokka i hope is  Chocolate Factory again
Who the frick wants a black girls as a main character
And I am officially excited for this movie
Looks like everyone in that movie had a lot of fun making it
They better get this right
Next big flop
I know that a directors history is important but does producers history has any significance to the movie making
""
Welp new ftish movie
Looks ok BUT Too much graphics The originals magic came from practical effects
""
Noooooo Not another remake
Omg Tymothe 
why did it make me emotional
No 
Comment section is full of bots
"This is absolutely ridiculous
This is a Willy Wonka for modern audience with the perfect diversity quotas  to improve inclusion and the commun sense and good story you just throw that in the trash 
I dont expect anything from this and I already know how well it will do in the box office"
"Timothe was amazing in Call Me By Your Name but feels like hes getting worse and worse

He completely lacks the eccentricity required to play a role like Wonka Its like watching a high school drama student"
Another movie no one asked for Another super production extra exaggerated to take you to the theaters and be forgotten forever after 1 month
Chalamet definitely channels Gene Wilder Perfect
The cringe is strong with this one
So when does he build a Train to survive the end of the world
Dude has the most punchable face in the universe
"Confucius says

Moving backwards is not moving at all"
He plays a amazing young Gene Wilder
The actor is so great
Who up Wonka they Willy 
"Not getting Christmas vibes from it though
Will watch only if its non woke"
Did i just see Rowan Atkinson as a Priest 
I heard the twist is that the entire movie is a spice dream and the credits roll right into Dune 2
Boring
This looks not that great
Prime Kino
I LOVE IT
"Ive always told myself that I liked both movie adaptations because of their duality Wilders is simple and straightforward with its plot and magic while Depps is more mysterious mystical and macabre
Since they confirmed this will be prequeling Gene Wilders adaptation Im looking forward to seeing that mystery and extravagance I felt from Depps and more for Wilders universe"
Johnny Depp is the best Willy Wonka
That looks like Harley from MLBB
This looks like Dolittle with Robert Downey jr
This movie looks good but the OG Author of the book said that he hated the Original Film so much that he wouldnt let anyone make any movies until he died Thats why the remake was made 15 years after his death So if youre gonna watch this movie remember that the OG Author is doesnt want it to exist
Rowan Atkinson is toxic in real life Why cast him in this otherwise fantastical movie
Couldnt they cast real small actors for the loompas I mean hugh grant is a fine actor but cmon enough with the CGI
Please stop this The first two times were enough
No matter what anyone says Willy wonka would never be the same as Johnny depp played but still giving timothy a chance for redemption
We need Jhonny Depp back  
Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is hilarious and pretty well acted btw
Gotta love this orchestral version of Gene Wilders Pure Imagination from the original movie
Warner Bros must hate money Why keep remaking the same movie over and over and over and over and over and over and over again
"I heard this movie was unwatchable in early screenings but holy cow

What is this overtly whimsical horse pup Is this a prequel to the Gene Wilder film Cuz this trailer doesnt resemble it in the slightest yet its pawning off my memories in cheap oneliners and references So who was this for Children

Also everyone praising Timmy C in this trailer is on drugs 

I am both confused and embarrassed"
This actually looks good Wow Ive gotta see this when it comes out
Im liking the whimsical energy of this
Im so torn because it looks great But I just wish that we could get some more original pieces instead of neverending cinematic universes and remakes retcons and reimaginings Can we ever just leave well enough alone
SO EXCITED
WhhhaaaIs this going to begood Did the good folks at Warner just get their Harry Potter extended universe
Lets just hope this version of Willy Wonka does not have a dentist as a father
Looks terrible
218  jajajaja is very funny 
I personally dont think timothee was a good pick he doesnt give me Wonka vibes at all and his voice is to raspy while the film looks good doesnt match with the og movie or to Johnnys wonka
stoooopid
Not again
Such a shame Keegan and Rowan Atkinson but its a childrens movie Ill miss it
i cant wait
"Is Wonka supposed to be American I always imagined him to be British since its a classic British book 

I mean America doesnt know how to make classic sweet milky chocolate Its all bitter"
When I heard Willy WonkaI can only imagine Johnny Depp
Depp is still the best
 there going with gene wilder version
Wokea
you gotta be kidding me
If they dont sell Wonka chocolate 
        
It look like its gonna be good
Timothee is truly one of the most brilliant young actors of this generation The phenomenal range he has
Extravagant production Cant wait
Seriously looks like nobody asked for this movie We already had two great wonka movies
Omg cant wait
Average
""
""
Im not sure Timothee has that warmth that gene wilder had Maybe hes more of a Johnny depp Wonka
Idk just from this trailer alone i dont think this has something to do with charlie and the chocolate factory starring johnny depp cause wonka here is waayy less unhinged its like two completely different person 
omg the guy from horrible histories
I dont know about this
"Cant wait for this I love Charlie and the chocolate factory films 
Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory 1971 
Charlie and the chocolate factory 2005 
Wonka 2023"
STOP WITH THESE GODDAME REMAKES
Who asked for this
    
it must be on the wishlist a happy and beautiful film very suitable to watch with family on Christmas and New Year holidays   
To unleash the chocolate jihaad That is my terrible purpose
you had me at paddington
This looks good
Glad the oompa loompas look the same as the original
now this is how you make a prequel so excited for the movie they even have my fav actors hugh grant and rowan atkinson playing comical characters this is going to be so good like they really captured the magical wonder of the story without the tone seeming too fake or awkward
Love from Asia hit like here
Jesus black people are everywhere now Im sick of this
I was iffy about it until they showed Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa Loved that part
I was  NOPE until Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa
The Hugh Grant casting is a thing of genius 
Isso parece incrvel Estou animado
I cant wait to hear Timothy sing I hope he has a good singing voice this looks like a great musical just from the dancing teases
Im so excited grew up watching the original Willy Wonka cant wait to see this one it looks really good
Cant wait for the part where Wonka goes Its Wonkin time
So excited for this 
No
After a long wait finally
Nice to see that snowpiercer is getting a prequel
How he meet the little men
Is it just me or I saw Mr been running around 
Hes good Too Good
This kid is not a movie star Sorry Dune is mediocre This looks terrible
Wheres Charlie
Huhuhhuhuhuhuhuhuuhhuhuhuh
Looks good please dont butcher another childhood movie franchise
I loved Johnny as this character but Ill give this a go looks good
Kinda wondering if they left out the edge that the original had for the trailer or if its not in the film at all
Hugh Grant as Oompa loompa sounds like Stewie from Family Guy
yes
Trailers not great but seeing that the paddington director is behind this gives me hope
AAAAAHHHHHH
Cant wait to see that
I have always loved Willy Wonka and Im so happy we will get to see an expansion of his character and story
i saw the thumbnail and said oh no D out loud
Seems a bit too young but oh well I cant wait for the next movie where he tortures and kills all those kids in his chocolate factory lmao
0102 is that Rowan Atkinson
wasnt he a massive recluse who hated everyone
LMAO TMOTHEE AS WONKA
"Oh my goodness I cant wait
I love movies so much

I want to be a movie director when I grow up
I cant wait to help create the worlds of fantasy In a way Id get to live in the magic worlds by making them Yes no"
Forced and weak
I just screamed MrBeancant wait for this
Swapped Charlie with a baboon 
Lol Hugh grant
This movie looks amazing Timothe Chalamet is a great actor and this new kind of role looks amazing
Imagine that the end that he meet Litlle Charlie bucket before the factory tour
Shweet
yooo
This is the movie I needed The prequel I never knew I needed
So MlD 
Who asked for this
"Anyone else very sceptical about the first look at Timothys performance in this  

I am gauging that he doesnt have the acting maturity to match up to the depth required for this role  and especially to match his Wonka predecessors 

Im worried he wont be able to make us care about this character as well as pull off the whimsical nature required to do the role justice 

Whereas Jean and Johnny both naturally had these traits and thus were perfectly cast This film depends even more on an a perfect casting for Wonka given that Wonka is the sole driving force of the film

I love Timothy in his other roles and understand why he is so popular atm but i think his popularity is the only reason hes been cast for the role not because he was the most appropriate actor 

I hope Im proven wrong If not its another example of Hollywood ruining another treasured franchise for a quick buck"
Stupid
incredible fr
"Going off visuals looks like its leaning towards the Original while having a bit of Tim Burtons moodiness 

Im interested"
The suspense is terrible I hope itll last  Willy Wonka 
I absolutely need to watch this
I will keep an open mind but Im a little concereed I must say
Look we all know Gene was the best But this looks interesting and Im more than willing to give it a shot
And then DeviantArt artists just showed up
AKA Fantastic Fudge and Where to Find It
Its too woke
So many memories
Something I never thought I wanna see And I still dont
man bad casting is a recurring theme these days
chocolate must be a euphemism for psychoactive chemicals
Bruh I dont wanna see this Timothy in every movie man wtf
3rd remake But why
This looks amazing Im watching this in imax when it comes out
What I love about his performance is that you can see little bits of Gene Wilder in there
Yay Now we can all finally get the untold story of how a renegade wizard and burgeoning serial killer somehow evaded the detection of the ministry of magic while fighting a war against the cartels in his area by making better candy then them
Wasnt sure if i was sold with this but seeing hugh grant as an oompa loompa i now NEED to see it
"Its nice and inclusive and diverse to have the young black woman as his sidekick No worries about your DEI score on this one 
The picture looks interesting"
The only reason I want to watch this is for Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa That is the only part of this movie that looks entertaining to me
""
I can see my inner child getting excited I remember watching the old movie when I was little all the time
I try to think what Gene Wilder would have said if he watched this trailer I think he would have been delighted to see someone like Mr Chalamet playing a younger version of wonka
this looks like a mistake lol
""
Hugh Grant Oompa Loompa is so cursed in the best way possible
My favourite part was when he said its Wonking time and he Wonked all over the place
omg mathew baynton yippeeing so hard rn
Another Wonka movie Hollywood is definitely running out of original ideas
I like how people have stopped acting stupid and are now willing to accept a new actor playing Willy Wonka
This is a world of pure imagination
omg
Someone please tag Michael Scott 
Im not sure what I just watched
This looks absolutely amazing and I cant wait to watch it even better that it comes out at Christmas 
This is more like it This is how you want to see Timothee as the good guy  Not a monster as he was in Bones and All which I refuse to watch  but I am looking foreword to Dune 2 and Wonka  looks like it will be a Timmy Holiday season this year
OMMMG HUGH GRANT AS OOMPA LOOMPA
No body Can beat JHONNY DEPP act like
MATTHEW 
no disrespect to tim but no one can beat depp
My favorite movie is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilde sorry to say but depp didnt do him justice this looks VERY promising 
No need for this remake  It cant possibly top the original How dare these Hollywood clown taint a perfect movie
"WOW WOW WOW the movie Wonka looks great I love Johnny Depps version  but this new version has a fresh and youthful air

 It will surely be spectacular to see it the musical scenes and how Willy Wonka opened the chocolate factory    But the best thing is Timothy Chalometts performance will surely break it so Im really looking forward to seeing this movie

 PS  the oompa loompa looks identical to the oompa loompas from the 1971 movie so both movies are connected "
From the Director of Paddington  ooooh were in for a ride my boi
Jonka
So excited for this Honestly the thumbnail is pretty weak and timothes look compared to Johnny depps wonka looked so plain that I did judge it before actually watching the trailer I admit but this is gonna be so good I mean theyve got some really great actors Even timothes acting seems really promising the way his wonka is erratic but not completely unhinged surprisingly works Totally looking forward to this And the oompa loompa bit is gonna be hilarious I just know it
Waste of time money and relevance next
Oh my god mr bean my idol
Willy Woka Gene Wilder was the only Willy Wonka Lets just hope Warner has learned from Disneys mistakes
Mr beeaan
NOT HUGH GRANT BEING AN OOMPA LOOMPA
"Johnny Depp as a Wonka was amazing 
 I like the young Wonka Timothee as well"
I am just excited to hear the oompa loompas sing
Can noone else sense the low quality of this big budget film ESG ratings have destroyed everything
Why tho
Is that Mathew Baynton From Horrible Histories And Yonderland And Ghosts
"Wonka 
WHAT HAPPENED TO WILLY"
Please for the love of God stop casting timothee Chalamet in everything  I actually like him as a person but he has no onscreen charisma imo  Should stick to smaller indie films
"Another flop

How and when did cinema fall so hard so fast

Maybe its the feminized male lead

Maybe its the poor casting

I dunno but its bad"
I was unsure about thisbut directed by the same director as Paddington and an unexpected Hugh Grantasanoompaloompa has sold me Plus I like Timothee
Remove the charm add CGI This will be a great strategy
Looks fun and inspiring 
 Oh ffs make an original movie already
OH MY GOD
i can wait for this the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Gene Wilder will always be my Willy Wonka 
Dont fumble the bag wb
Okay which one of you asked for this
terrible
It looks way more childish then I expected but will still be seated
Hmm Timothy doesnt convince me as Wonka ive only seen the trailer so maybe ill change my mind after seeing the movie Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa is great though 
Wow I want to vomit
My word Im SO excited for this Timothee you absolute rockstar
Might wanna lay off the Spice Paul
Why is there Jurassic Park music cues in this
Gene Wilder was the goat this dude doesnt have that weird quirkiness
This looks TERRIBLE
Wow
Looks very cute Cant wait to see it 3
Been waiting for this for too long
mmmmmm Im not a fan This looks boring and just a movie for children
Finally an Origin story of The Classic Willy Wonka Gene Wilder loved that one growing up especially the Oompa Loompas
Call me skeptical Timothy Chalamet  has impressed me in his other stuff but Im not seeing Willy Wonka here I hope Im wrong
Wish they called it willy
The good wonka
"Based on the previous movies he became miserable right
Will something bad happen to that girl at the end of that movie"
Well Not for me
Im not thoroughly convinced with Timothees performance from the trailer alone But I love the director of Paddington Sally Hawkins Olivia Colman and particularly Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa is an inspired choice but also not surprising given how incredible he was in Paddington 2
TC looks unexpectedly miscast Hes normally natural on screen but looks like hes acting here
who up wonking they willy rn
mathew baynton
This is so bad Please stop with these remakes and sequels Do something new
Oh no
they should some how give credit to johnny depp by exploring into future or something
OMG IM SO EXCITED
This will be as rememberable as Robert Downey Jrs Dr Dolittle
This is the second best day ever The first will be the day it releases in theaters
This will be a very promising Christmas present 3
Still has nothing on the originalLooks like wonka gets lost in fantastic beasts or Harry Potter
 
humchocolate may cause willie wonka hallucinations Oo
"Into the WonkaVerse
Interesting to see a prequel as we saw that in 2005 Johnny Depp version"
Sucessor of Jonny Depp
Wife and kid saw this in an early screening  Wife was surprised how good it was
cool
Amazing I love this I just wonder if this is a backstory Amazing job
Not a fan of Timothy but another Wonka story Meh Alright Ill wait till its streaming I guess 
Wow the music was phenomenal Hearing Pure Imagination like that brought back a lot of memories Excited for this
141 run away
I forgot about this lol
didnt need this Make new stories
and just as I thought we were safe there he is Hugh fing Grant Here to ruin everything with his overacted role which is the same in every movie hes in
I DIDNT KNOW THIS WAS BEING MADE  SOTHE WAY I LAUGHED WHEN I SAW TIMOTHEE CHALAMET AS WILLY WONKA IN THE THUMBNAIL NOTHING COULD HAVE PREPARED ME FOR THE SHOCK
Oh good lord no This looks terrible
I might watch this for the Giraffe
"why make a prequel while in the first movie there are flashbacks of Wonkas childhood and journeys 
I feel puzzled"
"I would love to be his actor
A lot of Chocolate and we needed Mr Bean here"
I literally have chills looks so good
This looks absolutely dreadful and bland Sorry but the world doesnt need yet another Willy wonka movie Dont  me
"It was nice to hear the music from Ready Player One hope to hear more of how they reworked it

Also the trailer gave me Cruella vibes I liked that movie so lets see how another origin story redeeming a famous psychotic character comes out"
Aaaah is Rowan Atkinson 
DING DING DING DING
Its too good
Yeah its good and all but I will watch for Rowan Atkinson also he Is a legend indeed
Who up wonking they willy
A Peep Show Reunion I shall be seated
Thank goodness its camp  its not tooooooooooooo serious
Its Wonkin Time
Just saw Olivia Colman in The Bear s2 and now here She never says no to a script and I love her for it 
Paul Atreidis decides to sell chocolates
Lets Go After Dune in November we have Willy Wonka in December
Something i needed but never expected a fresh movie with mr bean in it
He who can destroy a thing controls chocolate
THE WONKA IS NOW BACK AFTER 18 YEARS
Visual masterpiece
Timothe Chocolatemelt
Mr wonka wheres th oompa loompas
I was skeptical before for the trailer but now Im totally sold
TIMOTHY CHALAMET AS WONKA PERFECT CASTING
Does anyone saw Rowan Atkinson running
Its a no for me
"Incomming offended people because of the white washing of the Oompa Loompas even tho in the original movies they were like that
Movie looks fun worth watching in theaters"
Sorry not my Wonka
Now I want a Dune Fudge Bar or something silly
This looks awful
This looks wonderful
Am I the only one not buying Timothee in this role The zaniness feels so forced and unnatural
ah they replaced Tim Burtons Daddy issues Wonka with Make mommy proud Wonka  Either way looks very decent and I shall give them my money
Indian audience 
Would have loved to see a cameo from OG Willy Wonka
No imagination with these studios The same stories rehashed over and over again So much creation in the early 1900s And now its just rehasing the same thing over and over again Just sad
Any movie that has the hutzpah to cop a line from Monty Python is at least worth considering
this trailer smelled like chocolate to me wow
WOW the cinematography looks Great Not sure about the rest but will give it a chance
I think Timothy is a great actor but this film looks like rubbish The last remake with Johnny Depp was bad enough This updated version looks like it wants a shot at that title
Damn this actually looks great
watching this for keygan
amo el trailer ser una buena pelcula
Trash
Obnoxious from the first sight  There is only one Willy Wonka and he is not this sleazy kid
Finally a movie with some actual colours
Timothe Chalamet is the top actor of his generation 
This looks awful Hes over acting Likethis is a highschool stage production level of acting 
I really hope its not another boring musical I wonder who will replace the great Knight Christopher Lee
Johnny Depp is still number one to me
Okwhy is this a prequel to the 1971 adaptation Its deserves its own adaptation outright
What a pile of garbage I cant believe Im even seeing this
just watching Mrbean run confirms it for me that this will be a banger
It looks a bit awkward and rough around the edges but with good intentions I think The heartthrob to ooma loompa pipeline is really selling me on this movie
This may be my first timoththee chamalet movie I see
I want a movie after charlie gets the factory
You can almost smell the greed Its not made for any other reason than money
Oh I need to see this
Arent the Oompa Loompas bigger then that Also I now more interested in the girl Wonka is with her back story and what happened to her
Personally I feel Timothe is too hot for this role but that doesnt mean I wont watch it 
A Willy Wonka Origin Storydoes it crossover with Wolverine
We need Jhony depp
""
Johnson Mark Johnson Mark
This looks so pointlessly bad
Yes I love this
So my boy MuadDib decided to pour a bit of spice in chocolate business  interesting 
The legend himself Rowan Atkinson is in it Im gonna watch this movie no matter what
My favorite part was when willy said its wonking time and wonked all over the place
lil timmy tim
Hollywood listen This is how you market older classics to modern audiences while still paying tribute to what made them loved in the first place
Timothees expression in the video somehow reminds me of a young Leonardo DiCaprio
He does not have the charisma for this role also whos the token black
"I literally choked on my food when i saw Rowan Atkinson

a surprise to be sure but a welcome one"
Sorry terrible casting
Just make him a wizard and this will all make sense
I dont think Ive heard the word chocolate used so many times
""
There it is
Just the most iconic childhood movie coming back in a new form Cannot wait to go to theatre to watch this 
Quick question what is gods name is a chocolate cartel

Jeremy Allen White would have been a better choice
142 MR BEAN
This looks amazing
Ofcourse theres a black girl in it
Tim Chalamets great but theres one Willy Wonka and he goes by the name Gene Fcking Wilder rip
looks mid
All the American accents in a European setting is very jarring
Fantastic Sweets and Where to Try Them
Why did I feel so giddy with excitement when Sally Hawkins showed up  cant waitttt for this
I would very much like for this to be a whimsical fantasy adventure and not a devastating psychological thriller like the previous Chocolate Factory movies have been pls and ty xoxo
4K trailer from official publisher appreciation comment 
Deez
Sttuuupppiiiddddddd
omg i love movies that FEEL like this im so excited christmas and halloween movies make me feel so good on the inside 33
I dont feel the wackiness coming from Timothee hes just handsome This rather seems whack AF
If you insist on odd diversity why arent there any Asians Just sayin
Oh Mr Bean speaks
Not sure how Im going to feel about CGI oompa loompas but the rest looks incredibly promising
Cinema has gone down hill so quickly now our beloved childhood memories are being wiped for cooperate greed RIP childhood
Paul Atreides added Spice to his chocolate
i love timothee 
This year will be Timothees finest year And this new Willy Wonka movie is going to be really amazing and uplifting I can tell Its no wonder why Timothee Chalamet was the perfect choice to play Willy Wonka If Gene Wilder was fantastic then Timothee will easily follow his footsteps
I think Rowan Atkinson would have been more compelling Wonka
Anybody here who watched this trailer with a smile on their faces Im guilty
im gonna call it now Charlemagne is miscast  as Wonka while he is a great dramatic actor i dont see him fairing well in this movies tone
Sorry this is not going to work Hope I am wrong  I was hoping for a more serious rendition this time
Nope this aint it
No emotion and none of the eccentricity required to fill Gene Wilders shoes Either Timothee Chalamet phoned this one in or he was never that good of an actor to begin with No amount of fantastical music and special effects can make up for bad acting
Not only did no one ask for this but no one who likes respects the original book Gene Wilder film should like this Plus im fairly sure that as much as the books author hated the original film because of chances he would like this even less and probably wouldnt let this be made
Rowan Atkinson
  
"Yah
Okay
Ill watch that"
this looks so good and entertaining
Once we started we cant stop
Were doing this again huh
Abe 300 part 3 banao be ye kya chutiyapa ban rahe ho
This movie has always given me the creeps I had nightmares as a kid with the old original movie
The real cinema is back
matthew bayntonim sat
Yo no cambio por nada del mundo a la versin de Johnny Depp
It is not diverse enough as it should be for 19th century England
Here we go momma Dune woman starts singing
     
nope nope nope
This looks so lame Are there any new stories Jonny Depp wonka big shoes to fit
Love the casting and the production design here and I appreciate that shooting on digital saves time and is less expensive to shoot with but it definitely gives the film a cheaply made look compared to the cinematic quality of shooting on 35mm Dial of Destiny and the Fantastic Beasts movies also had this problem

""
Nonooooo  Im sorry I love Timothe but Wonka wasnt making that kind of magical stuff til way later on If this is his origin storyand his candy was already magical plus publicly known about then the kids and adults that visit his factory decades later would not be so in awe and wonder Also Oompa Loompa are bigger than that I also cant place the area or environment and Timothe slips in and out of character I dont think he was being given proper directionalso and last point if he is in old England in a majority white nationwhered he find a black assistant Did he bring her with him on his travels Where is she in the future
Gene Wilder would say f you so this is whats going to happen now were going to remake all the old movies go ahead its going to fail like the other Willy Wonka that failed theres only one thats with Gene Wilder have a good day
I miss Johnny Depp
Johnson Alan Johnson
dont like it gonna watch it
timothy isnt giving me the charismatic wonka vibes
Woah willy wonka prequel 
Remake of OG Wonka  cant wait and the same production of Harry Potter super excited
JOHNSON
Really not a fan of the actor thats playing Wonka
I thought this was an AIgenerated mock video until I saw Timothy Chalamet actually talk properly 
The subtitles at the start of the video scared me for a sec lmao
Im gonna cry
Oompa Loompas freak me out
Hugh grant
A masterpiece knocking on our doors cant wait to watch 
that girl looks like a inclusivity placement
Johnny Depp was an emotion that no one can replace from this movie I hope he has a cameo in this movie as Timothee Chalamet seems he has done a good job in acting as the grown up Charlie in this movie Have high hopes from this movie
WHAT
People saying hes nothing like Willy Wonka HE IS HE IS CLEARLY BASED OF THE TOP G WONKA GENE WILDER HIMSELF
I really miss eating Willy Wonka chocolate bars the last one I ate is called Whatchamacallit
Huh
ohhh i missed the oompa loompaasss
This looks dreadful
good old days 
Can we see Timothee topless in this That will be the icing on the chocolate cake 
Diversity cast again why they didnt cast a mexican girl because the chocolate is mexican
I thought 2023 was a bad year for movies but things are starting to look up now Winter 2023 is gonna be a blast with the release of this and TBOSAS
This looks like trash
oh to taste without my eyes
Looks pretty bad if you ask me Not something Ill be watching anytime soon Enjoy it those of you who do
Im so excited to see this movie Willy Wonkas is one of my favorite characters of all time
Uploaded 46 min ago and 556k views already seems like people are excited already
Oh I cannot wait
We wanted more origin story and were getting it Im not mad
Oh my god this looks so fun 
Can we just get a new movie instead of remaking the old ones
Willy Wonka loved himself a Chocolate Queen
some of the writing was cringe but this looks fun
No this has to be addressed why must there always be Africans shoehorned into every Caucasian film these days ENOUGH Timothe Chalamets accent felt offputting because very used to Johnny Depp and overall it looks annoying Rowin Atkinson was nice to see
flop incoming
How many very rich people looked at this in pre production looked at this and said Ohh yeah this will do good Really boggles the mind
Is it just me or is tim trying to replicate jhonny depps willy wonka
masterpiece is way
Milking it huh Goodness Hollywood is so unoriginal these days
Hopefully it wont have a bunch of wokewash garbage
yes
I thought wonka found oompa loompas by going deep into african woods
This is a different type of story cool 
This is gonna be an AMAZING PREQUEL
I bet chocolate made by Paul Atreides tastes like spice Melange
Looks great
After the barbie movie Ill see this as well
Looks fun but Wonka as a yank Nooooooo
Did i just see rowan Atkinson running in one of the scenes
I already know that this movie will be one of my comfort movies
AWESOME I cant wait
This actually looks pretty fun
This looks so bad
Nothing to see here just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity LMAO
Loving the theatrical performance with a pinch of being extra Ps i actually thought him playing Wonka was a joke didnt think this was real 
how is Timothe Chalamet in every new movie now
Jeremy Allen White was ROBBED
Timmy Wonka fr
It looks better than the tim Burton version
Horrible casting for willy wonkla
When Paul Atreides takes to much of the Spice
Im seated
Very good I love Willy Wonka so I will definitely watch this 
TIMOTHE ILL ALWAYS LAB U YOURE AMAZING
was hesitant but im sold
This looked good until the Oompa Loompa showed up II think we owe Deep Roy an apology
NO ME JODAS SE VE LINDISIMA
THE ENDING hahahaha I literally had to pause it to compose myself
This modern remake makes the chocolate taste terrible
Timothy
Wow this is a truly masterpiece  looks timothee chalamet do a amazing work they give wonderful experience cant waiting to see this in theaters
So AMAZING Hopefully Warner Bros Discovery dont ruins this
is that Mr Bean
""
Already saw that movie when it had Gene Wilder  Cant imagine this one will be better  Well continues skipping these until Hollywood has a creative original thought
This looks cute
It looks great but when i think Willy Wonka i just see Johnny Depp
Oh yes a remake about a monopoly capitalist who keeps free illegal ethnic workers in slave labor without pay
errrrrNO
Ngl I kinda like it
Oh award season will be abuzz
Love the scenery
This actor for Willy is absurd interesting
Twonka
White guy saves poor black girl
Nice  we had a original then a remake we dont talk about that and now were getting a prequel ok I am i love the Willy wonker movies hopefully  they get this one right 
""
Im really looking forward to this Willy Wonka prequel
The fact that two parts of my childhood Willy Wonka in general and Rowan Atkinson Mr Bean are in this movie makes me want to watch it so badly
Another one
I already know that the how do you like it  dark white  nutty   part is going to become a TikTok sound 
WHERE ARE THE NEGATIVE reviews WHY ARE YOU FILTERING THE COMMENTS
Why god why Hollywood pls just make new stories instead of beating preexisting media to death
Isnt it crazy when you go on these trailer videos and you see some of the most braindead and cringe bizarre comments of all time If you wanna see how stupid most of the population is just go to a movie trailer comment section
This goes off script and doesnt capture the message of the original movie or book Its intended to teach the audience about bad behavior in children
He who has the power to destroy something has the real control over it
Wow Timothee Chalamet wasnt lying This movie is gonna be gradea awesome 
This is going to be TRASH I gave already given it too much attention by just watching the trailer and I think im done
A whole lot of Paddington in the credits
What is this nonsense
     
Everyone looks wonderful except for Timothee Chalamet He just doesnt have that eccentric insane look like Gene Wilder or Nicholas Cage to be Willy Wonka  Im open to a new version but so far what Im seeing isnt impressive
good casts
This movie about to give me cavities
Wonka  Where is his willie 
"so Mary Poppins meets Willy Wonka
not my demographic I like the kid but he looks weak in this
maybe Hugh Grant can save it"
So he went from this to being a murderous psychopath
As a Catholic seeing Mr Bean as a Priest is an absolute win
Im over prequelslets have movies about the bitter end for our favorite characters
Ill be there no matter what
Wow it looks great Well i do miss johnny depps oompa loompas
Nothing to see here Just a small group of people defying the laws of gravity Lovely D
 
Lame
Looks like billy the kid
why is not willi wonka black  
Why is this perfect
I feel like Im the only one that doesnt like the look of this
So how does he manage to do all this without the dwarves
could be a fun watch
Another another reboot But why
Padingtons a great movie im expecting good show out of this
It would be amazing if Willy Wonka made his shop in the Uk
He should be the new Edward Scissorhand
of course there are black main characters in a movie which is set in a time when there were not many black people in london and the black people who lived in london would have little importance or rights i wish they would keep it real and stop trying to change history
Well this proves that the studios are out of original ideas
i hate him sm
this actually looks pretty good very whimsicalill have too check it out
Look forward to it

I love it when people starts floating in midair just by eating Willys candy none of them not even the police reacts horribly Theyre like Eh just another Tuesday
So how he get into Evil arc
 
I admire timothee for taking up a completely different role to his previous ones but Ill be honest I cant see Wonka as anyone else but Johnny depp
So is it the origin of the one from the 70s
No match of Charlie and the chocolate factory wonka can only be Johny Depp Hats off to that man he made wonka WILLY WONKA
Real original Hollywood 
At last someone uploading a film trailer at 4K
Is it supposed to be in Wakanda
What is Ansem the Wise doing here
Go woke go broke
Another wonka movie
Dude I saw this guy and I was like my god that is the perfect willy Wonka
Another one again Why
Timothe is the PERFECT cast for Willy Wonka no one can say otherwise
I can hear the music of the Shiloh Dynasty  Pure Imagination song in minute 130
First 5 seconds of the trailer and I can already tell hes gonna play an amazing wonka
Oscar is loading for Timothy
Holy Cow this looks good Is this an original movie or is it prequel to the Gene Wilder movie
whats paul from dune doing as wonka bruh
This trailer makes me want to have a chocolate bar right now 
Cool
Again with the rewriting of history I thought it was supposed to be set in Victorian Britain Anything odd about this trailer
Another boring film loading
SHUT UP I had a dream about Timothy last night and here he is playing one of the most curious characters from my childhood 
I was dubious but I think Im sold
WHY
After watching the masterpiece of Johnny in Charlie I feel like Timothy just might do this role justice
HUGH GRANT AS AN OOMPA LOOMPA my life is fufilled
Oh Ive been waiting for this day far too long 
How can you have Mrbean in the movie and only give him 2 sec of screen time in the trailer 
oddio tonno cioccolatino
Cant wait to see timothe chalamet poison a child with candy
In the original movie Wonka was whiter and there were no black people 
Looks like Timothees Wonka has the humor of Gene Wilders version and the personality of Johnny Depps version
The chocolate cartel 
Oh this looks fun and such a great cast
im actually kinda shocked and how interested i am in seeing this now lol
"Hugh Grant oompaloompa



bottom text"
This looks so dumb im sorry timmy
Gross
The suspense is terrible I hope it will last
Im teary eyed when his mum appeared  this is going to be amazing
This movie is being made by the same people that made Paddington and harry potter this bout to be good
So Charlie and the Chocolate Factory meets Harry Potter
This looks vastly better than I thought it would
i will love it but make new stories bruh
Could have saved money using real little people instead of cgi we get enough from superhero movies
After watching the BTS video and anticipating this we finally have a trailer
Not needed nor required but golly gosh does it look splendiferous
Now this is something I did not expect So far this looks great I think I found my swan song movie for this year
L movie
this made me have an urge to push 50 pounds of bowels out my body
SUICIDE SQUAD ISEKAI  WONKA
Timothee is amazing in this I already love it
"Amazed at how many blacks are in London at this time in history
Almost like its diversity quotas"
Yikes this is cringe
Ummmm wtf is this
Lol what
Im glad were going to dig into how he came to enslave a miniscule foreign people group
In my humble opinion Chalamet is not suited for this kind of character I can see him trying to play but I still see Chalamet not Willy Wonka I dont think this film will even come close to being as good as the original Johnny Depp film Depp is multifaceted I doubt anyone will play Willy Wonka better than him anymore
No daydreaming or a 3 dollar fine 
Woke
TIMOTHE CHALAMET OSCAR WINNER
"ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
fan girling so harddddd this looks like its gonna be so funnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnnn"
The best Willy Wonka will always be Johnny Depp
looks like harry potter from different universe
im a simple man i saw Rowan Atkinson running and screaming i put this on the must watch list
Many years later he met a boy called charlie
how do i know about wonka thanks to mr beast 
Soo excited 
Paul Atreides the Chocolatier  The Spice Chocolate is my favorite
In an alternate universe Paul Atreides is set to create his own spice factory
This looks awful
this looks fun im excited for it
How many times can you beat an old horse
cant wait to wonk my willy to this
A reason to live till December 
It felt like such a missed opportunity to not say The Greatest Chocolate Factory at 157
the actor playing wonka doesnt sound that great but aside from that it looks good
Why are there so many black people  Pass
Tim looks like a mix of Gene and Johnny how wonderful
Why
This is giving 
Hollywood just cant leave stuff alone Smh
Yeah nah It will probably just live in the shadow of Johnny Depp
HUGH GRANT IS ADORABLE AS A OOPAH LOOPAH
I see Mister Bean 
Sweet
I wonder if the oompa loompas are going to be slaves like in the book
This years biggest flop
We want Johnny Depp
Nope
There are some actors that no matter who they play all I see is the actor and not the character theyre playing
honesty i like this types of movies where you see the Orings of  a certain char  i also like how their going form the original movie
Gene Wilder will forever be the one true Willy Wonka Johnny Deep was ok at best
I clicked on the video because I had a Harry Potter vibe and also thought that the main character might be Daniel Radcliffe but it seriously reminded me of harry potter
Wow this looks bad
YOU DONT UNDERSTAND HOW EXCITED I AMMMM
Tbh I didnt like it at all Ive always like the more misterious version of Willy Wonka Not the happy guy But the crazy man thats lonely
looks soulless AF
why does timothee chalamet look so much like daniel thrasher in this
"I have several thoughts 
1 Hold up this is real 
2 028 CARSON
3 This looks visually awesome 
4 Timothee Chalamet is a perfect casting choice Nobody will match Gene Wilder but hell definitely be a great Wonka
5 Cue Tumblr losing their minds over Timmy as Willy Wonka 
6 Hugh Grant as the Oompa Loompas might be an even more perfect casting choice 
7 You can really tell the director also directed Paddington its got that same grey feel contrasted with the utter whimsy of the story 
8 Matt Lucas too Im watching this in theaters Congratulations your advertisement has worked"
This looks like it would be a poor Fantastic Beasts spinoff and somehow feels wholly unoriginal
 
That scumbag Grandpa Joe better not have politicked his way into this movie
Im gonna watch this explicitly for the scene of Rowan Atkinson running from a giraffe
Is that Rowan Atkinson on this movie to
Sometimes Im not a fan of prequels but I think itd be cool to see how he got his start becoming the famous chocolate maker we all know Plus I do like watch timothee chalamet
Ill stick with Gene Wilder and real orange midgets thank you
My favorite part is when he said Time to wonk my willy and Wonkad all over the place
Paddington is amazing Nic Cages said it everyone knows it and this is from the same director Im in
No thank you Dont need a woke lgbtq wonka
           
It looks good now but like everything nowadays watch it go from Wonka to Wokea
Is that Rowan Atkinson at 141
The fact that this was directed by the same guy who made Paddington Beae and the fact that this feels like it has the same tone as the OG film means that this will be an absolute incredible prequel RIP Gene Wilder
I think this has potential
rowan atkinson  lets goooo
Alan Johnson 
OMG This actually looks really good I will definitely be seeing this
Nope Not again with the swapping and the woking
Do we really need a 3rd wonka movie  Doubtful
Johnny Depp nailed this role
Another Willie Wonka is not what we asked for or what we need
Roald Dahl hated Israel Doo dah doo dah
"So Rowan Atkinson mr bean in the movie
Im waiting on"
Timothee doesnt have the snap or edge that Depp does
Perfect movie for Christmas time 
my Eye saw him as Timothee but my brain started replacing him with Jhonny depp automatically  what if Jhonny did it once again
Man its actually seems to be brilliant
I said omg another the child in lost in wonka factory movie gushhBut nope Smth was missing in this movies and t was actually Willy Wonkas life story Good idea
I find it funny how wonka keeps getting younger over the years  every movie was a different aged wonka
No
Willy wonka  mr bean is there
Wired acting
        
mr bean 
MR BEAN
Id like it nutty and peachy 021
This makes me miss Depp
153 looks exactly like Gene Wilder
Timothe i doubted you for this one but turns out you are perfect for wonka He is super talented
How tf is Timothee Chalamet so good at his job
This looks bad
I like Timothee but thats just not his type of character Its just the Trailer but Im not sure
How are yall not tired of seeing the same stuff over and over BUT ITS A PREQUEL  everything is becoming tired and worn out Do we really need another 10 movies like the fast series
I believe this Willy Wonka Prequel will be a masterpiece I believe the film and Timothee Chalamets performance will rank up there with Gene Wilders 1971 masterpiece Willy Wonka And The Chocolate Factory
Adorable
"Chinese food has MSG
and Movies have ESG

Its pretty pitiful how you can now predict how the casting will be controlled to have this we serve 1 flavor only twirl
ESG is literally the dystopian flavor police Willy Wonka would be up against no cap"
Ok sorry but Willy will always be Genes baby
Biggest thing is MATT is in this MATT ON MATT WE LOVE YOU
I was somewhat interested until once we start dancing we cant stop then I switched to hooked Hugh Grant in that tiny scene sold it for me
NICE
I literally screamed but still not gonna be as good as Depp
Amazing movie theme
Is that Mr Bean
"Whyyyy Actor Johnny Depp  
Whyyyy WARNER BROSSS"
still chasing that gene wilder
The Chocolate must flow
This is gonna be movie of the year isnt it
Willy Wonka to the Chocolate Cartel May thy knife chip and shatter
warnerbros  wonka any ticket to wonkalnand  Just on theater 
"Did Paul Atreides just turn into Gene Wilder

 Well color me convinced Lets go watch this"
after johnny depp this dosent hit the same
Love it
DEI is alive and well i see
Tim would be wonka
I thought this was going to be a gritty reboot kinda disappointed its not
Timothe being an incredible actor again
its wonkan time
Theyre really giving unnecessary backstories for every side character nowadays huh
no johny depp 
I love the part where Timothee Chamalet said its Wonkin time and starts to Wonk his Willy into a peach
Wokea
Barbie Wonka Warner Im poor Tickets in Brazil are expensive
""
I thought it would be a remake from 2005 So wrong I was 
""
This version of willy Wonka has a bit of the Gene Wilder with a twist
"Awesome Awesome Awesome  superhit
A double han han
People define Law of gravity "
Got the whole peep show  horrible histories squad haha class set of actors
Wowwwwwwww A WILLY WONKA movie Cant wait to watch it
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
"This year 
Oppenheimer
Barbie
Killers of the flower moon
Napoleon
Dune 2
And now this"
"Timothe chalamet give us nothing as always
He isnt expressive"
"What an ethnically diverse wonderland they all seem to live in 
So do you think its Wonka or the Oompa Loompas that instigate the genocide that must happen before Charlies story takes place"
Oh God Ive missed you Timothe 
damn i love willy wonka
Poor Copy of bollywood movie Dhoom 3 
"Gene Wilder would be so proud

We are the music makers And we are the dreamers of dreams"
Wow
Why is willy wonka american though
booooo im not watching it  Its trying to copy the originals success at least make it a little orignal
Timothee Chalamet is the Willy Wonka we never knew we needed
Paul Atreides plays Willy WonkaI got a mixed feeling about it
Why are the only films with any promise in the 2020s the ones with Timothe Chalamet
I was worried but then it said from the director of Paddington
"BROO THE WAY MY JAW DROPPED  
Im so excited to see Timoth playing wonka lets enjoy it all when it comes out"
Olivia Colman Sign me up
Looks beautiful and yes absolutely insane  I can not wait
I will stick with Tim Burtonthis is too childish
i like this
Except we didnt need yet another Wonka remake
Christmas time is the perfect time for this to release Smart thinking WB
Johnny depp is a must
i wouldnt mind having flight capabilities but how are you supposed to come back down
Do you think it gets into how he turned from fun loving to not be bothered by children being killed in industrial accidents at his factory
Atreides Chocolate
I wonder if Willy Wonka will finally bring good chocolate to America
Full of wonka wokeness and leftie bs
daaamnnn
Charlie and the chocolate factory
Yep Im watching this Its gonna be a classic
Kwisatz Haderachocolate
No hate to this movie but cant someone make something original
Wellguess I will put this on the theater schedule for Christmas
Is this a prequel to the original or a prequel to the reboot or a reboot of the reboot
WHO CARES ABOUT THE ORIGIN OF WILLY WONKA THE ORIGIN STORY DEMYSTIFIES THE CHARACTER DAMN IT HOLLYWOOD STOP THAT
""
"He made cookies Flavored them with lies Come on down to Simple Wills

Seriously tho Paul Atreides and Willy Wonka a month apart This dudes going sicko mode"
This movie looks absolutely magical I never knew I needed a willy wonka prequel but this looks like its gonna be a wonderful watch cant wait
Thx feels like I saw the whole movie
Hes not black Im disappointed
You know someone is going to have a go that you are using hugh grant head on someone with dwarfism  and not the true persons body
MAKE SOMETHING NEW
give some respect to mrbean his appearance in trailer is only 2 times what is this
they had to add a black token sidekick for political correctness  XD
Willy wonka prequal with Timothee s gonna be a lit 
This looks so good 
come back DEPP
So this is actually supposed to be the Gene Wilder wonka then
They finally understand the material  this looks amazing
I hope they make this movie a metaphor for slavery
I screamed when I saw Jim Carter  Downton Abbey is one of my favorite shows of all time 
"I I dont know if we needed this

Also its always a red flag when a film doesnt trust its predecessors and instead hedges their bets by being selfreferential in their humor The whole oopma loompa scene feels anachronistic"
Wow This movie seems better than I ever thought it would be Chalamet is definitely giving me a Gene Wilder vibes I am definitely buying a tickets to this thing 
Timothee Chalamet is basically the same character in every movie at this point he is Johnny Depp 20
Oh no
Aah finally the chocolate cartel is brought to light
I CANT BELIVE
i dont see keegan anywhere in the trailer but hes third on the casting list
looks amazing
theyre making another one
It looks nice actually
I hear they announced Wonka so excited for this 
""
I think the first came out in the 1980s correct if um wrong
I could tell that its HarryPotterish from the very beginning only
This looks like a bad SNL sketch 
unpopular opinion I dont think Timmy shouldve been the one to play that roleit doesnt suit him well
The magic the vibes the music Its all so wonderful Def wont be skipping this one
Hollyweird still out of ideas I see
Wonka and his poc friend 
Im interested but the whimsy that came so naturally to Gene Wilder feels reallyforced with Timothe Chalamet
Its interesting and it seems fun and I love Timothee but I dont know how its going to go if they change a lot because there was the original Willy Wonka which I think the old generationmy dad loved and then there was the one with Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore which I loved but I dont know maybe the new generation will like this one I cant say for sure but I hope this goes well I just find this weird and I only laughed when the guy ran away so I dont know how funny this one will be
Pass 
This movie is actually shot in Bath England where I live
I might actually go to a theatre for this
A willy wonka prequel really isnt necessary The original with Gene Wilder cant be beat Seems TC is taking inspo from Wilders willy wonka probably trying to steer clear from making JDs mistake of trying to completely reimagine willy wonka
This looks incredible They definitely chose a good actor for Willy I cant wait to see it
Oy Whats this then A bit TOO British innit Its got that dry dull feel of Paddington Cant explain it exactly Just not my cup of over steeped tea At least we have the original and at least Burton and JD tried something extra wonky This feels too bloody safe with dry briish umour
Wow Looks great Never thought that Timothy Chalamet could be Wonka but it absolutely fits 
Big Jingle Jangle vibes
I had no expectations at all but this truly looks good
Hes good Toooo Good 
Theyll make this an overwoke version of his story
Stooop pls dont  so many new movies to watch Yesss
It will be interesting to see how Timothe plays a different mood in this movie
Was iffytill the Daydreaming joke then I knew it could work
Oh another one
There might be something here
Nice trailer This only makes me wonder what happened with Wonkas friend
came here for timothe staying for hughoompa loompa
this looks rough i wish timothee was honestly playing it closer to his normal smug and glum self since i think he would pull that off better im not really interested in seeing him ape depps eccentric performance i also disagree with anyone saying he feels like gene wilder
"A shame they didnt get Brad Williams Peter Dinklage Warwick Davis etc for the Oompa Loompas
Hardly a shortage of funny little people"
This looks amazing
I cant wait to watch this
You cant tell me thats not Daniel Thrasher
Im something of a scientist myself
Knowing Timothee grew up as a dancer and he finally gets a role to show that off Im sooo happy for him
Whoaa cant wait for this one Bakalan pecah ini mah filmnyaa 
So its a prequel to the 70s one
LETS GOOOOO
"The movie where Jhonny depp was cast as Willy Wonka was about the lottery to lure the children all over the world and experience the world of Chocolate 
This movie seems to be about the Idea and rise of Willy Wonka 
Both are good in their own  perspective"
"For I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of Cephas then of the twelve
1 Corinthians 1535 KJV"
Uhhhhhh This feels like a home run lets just hope they stick the Landing
I was under the impression that this was a prequel to Johnny Depps Wonka but the fact that the Oompa Loompas are orange means that Timothee is actually playing a young version of Gene Wilders Wonka
Almost thought they forgotten small humans until end of trailer
Wonka just get ever more handsome as the years pass by
Looks good unfortunately Gene Wilder had this unique genius in restraint that Timothee Chalamet may not be able to carry Different version of Wonka I guess Hope its good
Is WB going to make now more and more  2nd part movies of famous movies of 90s  And also cast Timothee as future replacement of Jhonny Depp Hope they dont cast him as Jack Sparrow
Im surprised they didnt make Willy Wonka black
Carson 
damn this is here and im all for it
This looks so cute 
Im definitely booking my golden ticket for this show
This is what WB does best make movies without worrying about franchises keep going WB
Nothing to see here indeed Depressing
Hollywood try not to remake classic movie with one word title challenge impossible
Looks like its gonna be flop
why is the oompa loompa already my favorite character after like 10 seconds
Omfg  Not again
i think im gonna be sick
This looks pretty good
I suspect it will be Willy Woke and the Diverse Factory  Chalamet is a good actor but I think hes too young for the role But hey he had the right wokesanctioned beginnings so the woke industry opened all the doors to him Dont blame him he knows some day for some stupid lame reason they will come to cancel him too Thats the Woke Devils Contract
Who all expecting a Johnny Depp reference in the movie
Wow this is lookin GOOD
Wait I just spotted Rowan Atkinson 141
Anyone else reminded of the 1971 original has a strong taste of Gene wilders charm
142 Rowan atkinson
Im sorry but I hate his voice its just not wonkalike if you know what I mean its not magical and full of wonder
It has the classical old English flim with modern twist to it ahhah
mr beeeeeaaannn
This is a lame attempt at trying to capture on an old IP Stop making reboots and rehashes of the same old garbage Make something original if you can
And with that i will forever see Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
To be honest I can only see Timothee Chalamet pretending to be Willy Wonka I dont feel like seeing Willy Wonka I dont know if its because hes not a great actor or just doesnt match the character
If Keegan is in a movie Ill definitely watch it
I miss JDepp
Good Remake for sure
This looks great I cant wait
We doing this again 
But then how come we never see his assistant in the later storylines 
OHMYGODDDDDDD
Better than I thought it was gonna be I like how oompa loompa is a mix of both film versions appearance of 70s and height of 05 If I recall the  book version didnt have orange skin or green hair though I did read it like 20 odd years ago
I dont know didnt see the ECCENTRIC in it
How many of these movies need to be made like where the creatively
I dont see this dude becoming the unhinged chocolate man that haunted my nightmares as a kid Looks good either way
Bro reminds me of my old primary school teacher
I will definitely be seeing Rowan Atkinson in this movie Im a big fan of him We only saw him briefly in this trailer
It looks good but have they just scrapped the original idea or just the start of his origins
I hope the movie doesnt end up being wonky 
140 IMMA GIRAFFE 
No es como la esperabaes mucho mejor se ve espectacular ya quiera verlaaa
Chills
Bring in Johnny Depp
Why couldnt they find a better lead actor
116 is that keegan michael key 
I kinda want to give this a chance
Nice feel good moviewe all need this 
this movie has an amazing cast from the looks of it
OH MY GOODNESS IM LITERALLY SHAKING MY BOOTS IM CRYIIIINGGGGGG 
Is there anything woke about it
Ok so this looks incredible
This looks so good
Warner Bros better be selling Wonka theme chocolates to promote this film If not thats a missed opportunity
In springtime the only pretty ring time When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding Sweet lovers love the spring
You get fined for daydreaming in this movie Thats not right Poor Wonka
Josie my beautiful boy
I really dig this vibe finally someone using an old IP but doing something new
"Paddington Director
Oh so this will be peak"
Who wants a postcredit scene where we see Johnny Deep Wonka and Charlie starting their adventure on the glass elevator
MR BEAN MISS HIM
Disappointment
Now why remake the original
i thought this would be all dark but its like nice childish and fun like i actually wanna see this
I know its just fiction but seeing black people in victorian era style movies always makes me cringe Its actually comical how hard Hollywood tries to rewrite history and make it more inclusive
I wasnt sold until Hugh Grant showed up as an oompa loompa
i bursted out crying this is not okay
Dune 3 is looking wild
ugh stop already quit messing with our childhood memories please
AND ON MY BIRTHDAY
My favourite moment when he said Its wonkin time
EYOOOOOO
looks like itll be ok meh i like the oompaloompa i prefer Wonkas backstory to be a mystery
But he doesnt look weird and that is a big part of willy wonka He looks like a very nice human being Ill watch it but I dont know if im going to believe that he is actually willy wonka
No daydreaming 
I had my doubts but it does look good and my god tha cast though brilliant So many amazing actors one that surprised me the most in that trailer was Mathew Baynton from Ghosts Yonderland Horrible Histories also I read his costar from those shows Simon Farnby is also gonna be in it may have been in the trailer but didnt see him Also Olivia Colman and Matt Lucas plus Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa Just looks awesome
Im not feeling it  Bit dated but cant beat the original
Warner Bros fully committed to make flop after flop until bankruptcy
I heard Paddington I am all in
In the score for the trailer you can hear a subtle sample from Pure Imagination 130
Wooooowww
So youre telling me that Willy Wonka went up against the chocolate mafia before he had to create his empire  I am so onboard with this
Certain characters are really feeling out of place
boi what de
Does this take place in Africa
Looks like good family fun And another opportunity for Timothy to show his versatility Hopefully no political junk and just a good holiday film
Man that scene where willy said Its wonking time and chocolated everyone in the room cinema right there
Finally 
Me and my family were in Bath when they were filming the snowy scenes its so cool to see it in the trailer omgg
Its a no
I dont think Timothe is doing any good here
i didnt realize this was the thing i needed for this long
117 KeeganMichael Key is always ways fun to see 
For me all they needed was a title card reading From the director of Paddington SOLD
this actually looks really cute and charming Ok im interested
Replace the o with an a
at first was like wait another willy wonka movie but then realize oh its the orgin of wonka  we only seen him when he was already famous now we see how he got there  cant wait to watch
Looks like garbage
""
Loved this so much 
this could be cool lets wait and watch ig
This should be good
Dont worry everyone Theres enough diversity for it to win Best Picture at the Oscars Oppenheimer isnt even qualified to be nominated Easy win
Mat Baynton 
So a preprequel to Snowpiercer Nice
"I happened to be in Oxford on the day they were filming a scene Production meant they had to close the Bodleian Library as well as the streets in front and around

My main memory of that day is of my girlfriend infuriated at the minor inconvenience saying I WILL PUNCH TIMOTHY CHALAMET IN THE FACE"
Yaasss I am so freaking excited
Johnny depp is dearly missed
Flop
Pog
""
I dont know why but I smiled all the way through this 
Wow an overacting cringe fest  Cool
whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat
No Daydreaming 
I didnt know that Willy was a quirked up little twink in his youth but whatever I dig it
"I hope this movie explains all the future child torture endangerment
Lol just kidding "
Umm interesting 
1800s Britain is looking very ethnic No thanks
Whos the lead role actor
Hmmmm Ill reserve judgement Im not completely hooked but I bet itll be good with the director of Paddington
I like this Wonka the only version of WIlly Wonka doesnt feel like creepy man  Sorry Johnny Depps Wonka do feel like a creepy man for me
When are they going adapt Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator
Meh looks ok I guess
nah we didnt need it  We already have the best movie stop milking it
This is amazing Did i see Rowan Atkinson
I didnt imagine that could be the prequel to this classic film or the book
Wasting time and money making these movies nobody wants
Would love to see a cameo from Freddie Highmore
I dont know if Timothy Chalamet can compete with Johny Depps Willy Wonka Timothy is a great actor dont get me wrong here But Johny set the bar too high for this one Just my opinion though
I cant get past the fact that every time Timothy speaks he sounds like hes reading a story to a group of five year olds
The whimsicality of everything in this trailer I think I like it
 musical
WOAH
Nice a prequal atleast well finnaly know how h started everything before killing 4 kids and hold one his dark legacy
Why why ruin such a great film by making this sad excuse of a remake this made me cringe
Oh good another remake Seems like the Writers Strike has changed nothing
Qu ya no pueden escribir un guion original
"Oompa Loompa dopade do
Ive got a good felling about this do you"
since this is not a tim burton modern nightmare this already is a W
"Mr Wonka whats the secret behind your magical chocolates 

A little bit of the spice melange is all it take mdear"
I Miss the Johhny wonka
Gonna flop
Wonkas father was not a dentistmeh
""
Love the fact the opening notes sound exactly the same as the jurassic park trailers
Will there be a Blueberry inflation scene in this film
I love this I wonder if it will make any reference to burtons wonka Im glad this takes after the first wonka movie but both versions stay deep hard of peoples memories
Here we go mama
Eh everyting looks pretty good if not really good but plot wise from what I got in the trailer and Timothee Chalamet as Wonka isnt doing it for me Its all really meh
oohh i love this already
Is that Alan Johnson there
""
I thought it would just be a pointless remake but a prequel It looks really good and I am excited for its release
Nothing can beat Jhonny Depps version of Willy Wonka
Amazing 
pjexplained flickverse
Hi
We need a chocolate brand named Wonka RIGHT NOW
I just have a feeling this film will be beautiful because just this short trailer captured the magic and joy of the willy wonka and I cant wait to see it
Idk if thats Timothys natural voice but I just love his accent in this movie
Ewww
Look like shite
Imagine if they put effort into a new movie idea instead of redoing all of the old ones
Well done Timothee staying with a more natual accent to you instead of a bad imitation
This looks surprisingly not bad and Chalamet looks like hes having a surprising amount of fun doing it
This is gonna be a great theory
Ill give this a shot
Mr bean
Time to wonk my Willy
Really not very excited for this prequel maybe my time is over too see these sort of movies n more importantly Mr johny Depp is someone who put something in Ur heart that u wont be able to accept anyone playing his role
"After spending 2 year with brits
Wanka isnt the same word it used to be"
captain jack sparrow as willy wonka is unreplaceable
Again black woke
This looks so formulaic Ah yes believe in yourself and dont give up on your dreams Revolutionary
Rowan Atkinson just came out of nowhere 
""
The continuity problems are bothering me
not again
oh my oh my
I was like Hugh Grant Where Did I miss him shows up at end video  oh ohhhhhh oh 
Literally smiling from ear to ear with this Its my favourite childhood book movie on them all Cant wait 
This is just Paul Atreides dream whenever he hit them spices
The trailer showed the whole movie I hate such trailers
I want A  SEQUEL
Looks like it made for 10yr olds
I wanna see this even though i am in my 30s i love the first Willy Wonka since i was 5
     
Why make this Not dark enough for my taste
Dark White Nutty
let is goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
An origin about Willy Wonka Huh neat
Hollwood running out of ideas kind of frustratingmaking same movies over and over again
I didnt know how much I wanted to see hugh grant as the oompa loompas
Hugh Grant wtf 
Paul Atreides and the Chocolate Factory
this sucks dudes
Why are they trying to tiktokify every movie nowadays 
Chocolate dealer in the streets Kwisatz Haderach in the sheets
Yeah this is seriously going to hit the emotional sweet spot for me Pun intended
Timothe is trying to so hard to come across as curious and eccentric but he is not nailing it
Literally no one asked for this
Didnt know THIS would come out today Pretty hyped to see this Wonka dudes origin storyin scrumdiddlyumptious IMAX
""
give a double HAAAAA
nooo Tim Wonka is not secy
"What a way to have this trailer first thing on my feed I deserved to see this  hehe

Pretty excited to seee this "
Umm yes  also Hugh Grant always accepts the weirdest roles now and Im living for it  I love that man soooo much 
Can someone explain why Hollywood think the world is just black and white Where are all the other ethnic groups Why boast diversity when they only accept one other group
"
Just a random joke in cyrillic"
Im so excited to see Willy Wonka promoting diabetes
Is it considered offensive to cast midgets as oompa lumpas now We gota have freaky CG body now
Oh man Im actually super ready
I really hope the embarrassingly sappy music isnt part of the actual score  Its a total misfire total mismatch
I see that the molestation of Roald Dahl continues
Mr Carsonnnnnn
"not that many black people were present in that time period

there are people flying pink clouds and a tiny red skinned person in the trailer and the first thing that comes to your mind is black people do not deserve to be in FANTASY movies"
Trash
This looks magical
Movies will continue to flop lmao
Willy Wonka you enslaver
1 min in and its already a big NO Johnny Depp was better and movie studios were too in that time
Np plz
Mr Bean be like RUN AWAY 
Willy wonka and the chocolate factory prequel
I was hoping for a more grounded movie I think But this looks pretty decent and High Grant as an oompa loompa is pretty next level casting
how dare you let this tiktok twerp play such a classic and beloved character you morons vindicate the worst most shallow young people now why dont you get selena gomez to play gilda thankyou for making me an angrier person
I loved when he said Its wonkin time
Im just glad they didnt make Wonka black
I saw Mr Bean 
"Movie usher Can i help you

Me Yes 2 tickets to see Wonka one large popcorn One large Mt DEW 1 hotdog and a bag sour skittles

Usher Here you go enjoy the movie 

Me You dame right "
Weird Did anyone ask for this
This actually looks good
ah
Oh this is going to be fun
Hey so excited for this
Wowww
Gene Wilder Christopher Lee and Johnny Depps career all are rolling in their graves
The same director of Paddington
When a movie gets rebooted for a second or third time Is that a reboot or a triboot
Ive got to see this It looks amazing
Lollipops
My dream is to atleast get a taste  of Wonka chocolate 
At least this movie is going with a different angle  more towards an origin story Looks interesting
oh im ready for the most magical Christmas ever
I actually thought this was Charlie And The Chocolate Factory but with a different title But now with this trailer I see its a prequel to Wonkas success I hope they create Charlie And The Chocolate Factory after this
Pass Gene Wilder we miss you
so they are remaking the oompa loompas combining theyr original colors with the modern times Also at least now we know that his mother was alive when he was young and was on his side or meaby they are just erasing his father
Oh No
Goood
So they replaced Charlie with a girl named Charlene
Wonka showing the general public magic powers goes against why he was a mysterious man Takes the magic away of the film
My favorite oompa was when the loompa said doobadee doo and proceeded to oompa all over the loompa
They got Mr Bean in it Im defiantly watching
Watching Timothee Chalamet in this with Dune Pt 2 fresh in the back of my head will be a doozy
His Willy is gone
Its weird they didnt cast a black female for protagonist
This man dated the daughter of the actor who last played Willy Wonka and now he played the same character
This is a prequel to the iconic charlie and the chocolate factory released in 2005 i think
Can we not get some new characters Why do we need another adaptation STOP
Is that that timmyguy from the sand movies
"Isnt that Atkinson as a priest  
Solid casts "
Gat  146  uno
The moment  I hear chocolate cartel and Im invested
loving the cinematics and theatrical acting in this one already 
Why is charlie not in it
timmy looks so good omg
ngl Timothe Chalamet kinda looks like Daniel Thrasher to me especially in this role
I am so excited for all of the nostalgia but i am also worried that this might be too much of a kids movie
270 views
I dont think timothee cant do it
warner brothers making the 3rd charlie and the chocolate factory
Come With Me And Youll Be In A World Of Pure Imagination
I love this year
As long as we dont see grandpa Joe in any capacity this movie is gonna rock
Nothing beats the Willy Wonka played by Johnny Depp
Tim burton will be proud
YEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSS it shouldve said from the team behind Paddington and the producer of the witches and Matilda the Musical
Well i never knew i needed this movie before i watched this trailer Im hyped
This looks imaginative as a movie based upon a Roald Dahl book should be
This film seemed to be following me around at one point I went to Lyme Regis and they were filming on the Cobb then I went to Bath and they were filming there too There was a lot of fake snow involved
Nice
Looks awful
Did that oompa loompa played that og flute tune
I dunno  why do we have to keep revisiting classics The original is a masterpiece as it is I dont need a prequel or sequels Come up with a unique story line to amaze us like those did back in the day
This is a thing i never expected in a 100 years
This movie is confirmed to be a prequel to Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory 1971 I am ten times more excited for this movie than ever
Thought it would be like a darker PG13 film not sure how I feel about this
II dont know what to even say about the Hugh Grant Oompa Loompaother than I cant look away
No just no
First movie where this dude doesnt have a resting poker sad face
Sadly not feeling it from the trailer
all these prequels and sequels are overused and outdated atp that being said I will be watching this in theatre
Mr Cacao Bean1
Thank god wonka not black
just glad were getting more
What will Johnny Depp  the other cast from the 2006 film think about this
"   

"
When I saw the thumbnail I thought at first it was one of those Wes Anderson AI meme videos
""
Woke asf
Well this looks awful
This trailer looks awesome And I wouldve never expected hugh grant as the Oompa Loompas but Im here for it
Wtf
Willy Wonka is a wizard That explains a lot
Wowww
Mr Bean
In a world where chocolate was a competition and freedom was never an option of imagination there lived one person that had the power of magic that made the most brilliant confectionery that everyone can have fun and play
Oh come on This looks fantastic
Who let Ziggy out of prison
Woodrow Wilson Willy Wonka Walter White You got me
Johnny Depp as Wonka
Where is the oompa loompas people
white savior or does he just like little girls that are the color of chocolate
I Still wish that a Charlie and the great glass elevator movie would be made
This trailer was way better than I was expecting
Yes
Willy Wonka is like the James Bond of kids films He gets a new face every few years
oh jeez
Looks like its a musical
Wow
Mr bean
Im sorry but it looks lame and superficial
Hugh Grant being cast as the Oompa Loompas is not something we wanted but something we needed
black business owners pre 60s sure
cant wait for this
WO 
Brilliant And Hugh Grant 
Kardashian curse big flop incoming
 where jhonny
Anything better than that atrocity with Johnny Depp
There is no stopping an oompa loompa when he is about to sing
Am I the only one who feels like Timothee isnt a good fit for this role
I am CRYING SCREAMING  I CANNOT WAIT
lol in the first few seconds I watched this trailer I was like I am getting Wonka meets Harry Potter vibes and then the trailer told me its made by the Harry Potter Producers and I am like and there it is  It looks visually beautiful I am not sure what I think but willing to give it a shot
why is Mizkif on the thumbnail KEKW

looks like a funny ride for christmas
Im so excited this just turned my mood completely up
Almost thought this was fake
I hope this trailer will be seen with Wish which is the new Disney Animation that comes out November 22
Im not gonna watch this
Didnt know Britain was so ethnically diverse back then
Rowan Atkinson is also in the movie and thats hilarious 
Sugary Goodness 
Im watching this purely for the fact that Alan Johnson peep show is in it 
Idk why but this made me tear up
oh damn Timmy finally gotta do some actual acting lol
I want johnny depp become to cameo of this movie
Did they only have one set to film on
Everything except a JHonny Depp wannabe Timothy Looks perfect
Depp
PEOPLE WILL ONLY WATCH THIS MOVIE BECAUSE OF ROWAN ATKINSON CYKA
AHHHH I CANT WAIT FOR THIS MOVIE TO BE IN THEATERS 3
"This looks fantastic Trailer sparked my interest that I didnt have before about this movie

I also got taste for milk chocolate"
WHAT A CAST
I feel like since its directed by the person who did Paddington its not going to be good I really dont get people who say Paddington is a good reference how 
Ommgggg YESSSSSS
Another musical with less soul than the original no thanks Hollywood is out of ideas 
amazing
This mans acting as Willy Wonka is abysmal and does not fit one bit
I want to bring my entire family to see this movie on the Cinema I LOVE WILLY WONKA FOREVER
did i just saw rowan atkinson 
wheres Johnny
Harry potter kidhar hai
Seems like Rowan Atkinson is either ignored or wasted in this classic
 
Wow what a trailer cut
Hugh Grant as Oompa Loompa and Rowan Atkinson small role as a priest is just brilliant 
OH MY GOD ITS HAPPENING EVERYONE STAY CALM
I like Timothy Chalamet but not buying him in this role like at all  lol  Seems forced at least from the trailer
Mr Wonka Is Back
Mr Bean lets gooo
Was that Mr bean
If theres no blueberry inflation we riot at dawn
Looks fun Something I think we all need right now
Wont waste money on this drivel
my therapist Willy Winka prequel doesnt exist Willy Wonka prequel
why cant wonka be a transgendered african American This movie should be cancelled
I couldnt imagine anyone else but Timothee playing young Willy wonka 
This looks really GOOD 
A willy wonka prequel is unexpected
Ridiculous No need for anymore Wonka films
They arent doing the true origin of the Oompa Loompas from the first printing of the book Its not an accurate adaptation
Not a huge fan of wonka casting but imo mr bean and huge grant will be the highlight of the show and i m all ready for that this looks good
Finally after a few years of waiting since it was announced we have the trailer and release date
I never liked Charlie and the chocolate factory
Gene Wilder is Wonka
mat baynton mat baynton mat baynton 
Og comment 
Look At Little final destination Jr Really Good
"When I grew up watching huge films in the cinema like Harry Potter Lord of the Rings I remember this overwhelming sense of emotion after watching the film as if a whole generation has just taught me something extremely important within the storytelling
I would leave the cinema deep in thought and it would genuinely contribute to my development as a human
I feel like this has been missed in many films these days and I just have a good feeling that this will bring that same experience back to me

I will 100 watch this in the cinema Looking forward to it"
timothy chaomellete
I loved the part when Wonka said Its Wonking time
Looks pretty bad sick and tired of black people getting crammed into everything
Its Wonka Time Sent chills down my spine The prequel to dune we didnt know we needed
I cant tell if this is supposed to be London or Wakanda
This is without a doubt one of the best trailers Ive ever seenIve been wondering when wed see a new Wonka movie
Honestly think this is the worst actor ever Ive tried watching his movies and I just cant Something sinister about this guy either way his movies are awful its way to early for this remake he has no chance against Jonny Dept performance
It feels like watching Fantastic Beasts trailer 
Rowan Atkinson 
Wow
Just what no one asked for another Wonka movie
"Naaaa not better than Johnny Depps Willy wonka 
not gonna watch it"
Who up wonkin their willy
""
Wonka never been hotter
mr bean in the house
Im glad they using the original Willy Wonka in this movie I mean it was the original even if I preferred the 2005 film
Wow lets repackage another great movie for the second time 
2 Timmy movies this year what more could you wish for
I was just in a Willy Wonka Jr play and now theyre doing a movie THIS I PS GONNA BE AWSOMWWE 
"Well its not Gene Wilder but hell eventually become him if the Oompa Loompa design is any indication

Well anything is better than the Tim Burton adaptation"
Ah yes another movie involving Willy Wonka
It would be great to have Johnny Depp make an appearance in this movie
Cant wait
So shines a good deed in a weary world
I wanna cry This is so beautiful Reminded me of my childhood the good ol days
Im excited for this movie
Bunch of unoriginal assclowns making these movies LMAO
Im surprised they didnt make willy Wonka a black female
The Usul MuadDib if Leto Atreides wasnt murdered
"Me We dont need a back ground story of every classic 

Also me I need to see this"
Whhhhhy
Gene wilder mixed with Johnny depp
That is looking sssssssooooo much better than I was expecting Oh my the best Willy Wonka to be 
Looks so promising
Am I just not fit for this world anymore All these comments praising this  that was one of the worst trailers Ive ever seen This is barely better than the trsiler for Cats
Hollywood cant do anything original anymore They just cant
Getting more Depp vibes than Wilder vibes But who knows
Mr Beannnn
Can we go a year without remakes we did not need this
Please stop
I cant wait for this to bomb
The chocolate is spiced
Timothy looks a lot like Gene Wilder aka the Willy Wonka from 1971 in this
Nahh Timothee couldnt really carry out the character of Woka  Jhonny was undoubtedly the best
I think this actually looks really good I just dont understand the Oompa Loompas size
This is the kind of movie magic we need back
""
RIP Gene Wilder
This looks kinda horrible Timothe Chalamet is clearly a miscast
Do we REALLY need this
Why this look good lmao
Fresh breath of air
bean 
Nope
Its gone from Willy Wonka to Michael jackson to Justin Bieber in I feel Funny
OMG I dont know whos more excited me or my son lol Probably me
R u all right Or r u all left
Thisactually looks good A musical based on Wonka is a great choice
Did i happen to see Mr Bean 
willy wonka goes viral
Kinda wish they wouldve used an actual dwarf for Oompa Loompas Im slowly getting Chalamated out The dude is everywhere
Really hope Johnny Depp likes this
Wow Timothee was spectacularly bad as Willy Wonka  Whats what about
Lets talk about Rowan Atkinson
Why the forced black girl Smh every single movie just has to force diversity Every single one lol
Um I mean I dont want to judge this movie too harshly before it came out but who thought a Willy Wonka origin story was a good idea
Surprising how nobodys talking about Johnny Depp
Who knew a Willy Wonka prequel would look this good
"0102 MR BEAN 
0141 MR BEAN "
This actually looks really fun The director of Paddington always seems to know what hes doing
Oh ffs why do you have to force black people into a classic
I have to wait until Christmasofc ill still watch it
who wonking they willy rn
Omg looks insanely bad What
Ummmm so this whole universe has been magic
Even just that single shot of Sally Hawkins made me tear up Heres hoping Paul King is able to bring just as much magic and whimsy to this film as he did to the Paddington movies
Who let Paul Atreides cook 
I have seen a lot of people waiting for this one  but its looks nice 
What Willy wonka is this Is this the young gene wilder or the young Johnny depp one
I was skeptical that Timothee Chalamet could pull off a quirky character like Wonka and Im still not convinced
If youre familar with that famous blooper from the original film I wonder if any kids will be hit underneath the chin in this film
The kid in me really wants to watch this
Better than johnny depp
I really want this to be good I really do
ok the oompa loompa sold it
WAS THAT MR BEAN
""
This is going be bad
Why  Bruh
Yeah this is gonna be huge I smell a trilogy
Perfect opportunity for representation in this story 
This is more like it  Wasnt a fan of the remake but this prequel looks fun
Super duper awesome trailer Cant wait Love you Timmy 
141 is that Rowan Atkinson
"How do you like it
Dark white nutty Insane"
Gene Wilder made the best chocolate
Fantastica ya quiero verla timothe es un gran actor
005 he said the thing
charlie and the chocolat factory X fantastic beasts
Man DUNE Part 2 looking straight fire bro
Its Wonkin time
They got Charlies mom from Charlie and the chocolate factory to cameo
As you can see Noble House of Atrides start with very low beginning but they never  ever stop dreaming
One Of The Best Willy Wonka Prequel
This film looks to delightful not to watch especially when you have the man you bought us Paddington directing with a cast this stacked
Paddington
This looks awful Sadly
Wow so theyve ruined  my childhood again brilliant
Definitely taking the christmas fam to watch this
102 wait a minute
""
I think this movie will beat Warners Aquaman 2 unless it gets rescheduled again It seems like a more family Christmas premiere than Arthur Currys troubled sequel even though I enjoyed the first installment in 2018
Feels out of the concept
How does this seem like a completely different story but it still feels within the same world
Timothy usually has a wide range of facial expressions but in this one he seems to simply reading the script
I like the scene when Will Wonka says Its Wonking time
CRYING
Wow Timothee this is amazing I cant wait
He doesnt have the charisma but the visuals look interesting
Who up wonking they willy rn
Chances of the greatest Wonka ever Johnny Depp appearing
Here we go mama So not only will I be seated in theaters on Christmas Day but I will also be an absolute wreck in theaters on Christmas Day 
Ok the premake thats prequel  remake fatigue is starting to set in
Rosen Atkinson and Hugh grant
looks good but maybe cause I didnt have any expectations
It looks fun
Love the chocolate cartel concept
Wow
Loving it already 
Rowan Atkinson Yeeeees
Wish I had 4 hands so I could give this 4 thumbs down
AAAAAAAAAAAAA
What about Johnny Depp they could atleast give him a good scene
looks stupid and woke
Why do I feel like its Timothe Chalamet pretending to be Willy Wonka 
Why is Willy Wonka a 17 year old
Chalamet is the perfect choice 
DANG IT FINE ILL WATCH THE MOVIE
Timothy has to be the worst casting for Willy Wonka of all time Sounds like an amateur actor in this
I would like to like this but Im so tired of remakes its lazy and a lack of artistic vision theres millions of stories out there to tell
Im gonna tell my children this was Dune part 2
This looks like a cinematic wonder
Wasnt this going to be a musical
His voice just isnt cutting it
This is what happens when theater kids get a green light
this was an emotional rollercoaster i cant wait for this one this year is about to be NOSTALGIC
Another flop in coming  Hollywoke still cant come up with fresh innovative ideas lmao
They couldve changed his hairstyle at least Its the same in all movies A bowl cut wouldve been nicer like Johny depps version
Focusing on a young Willy Wonka and how he came to meet the OompaLoompas on one of his earliest adventures
The WWCU is getting pretty wild
""
It looks good but something feels off
Okay I was skeptical but there might be something to this movie Getting the director of Paddington was the right move
No one can beat Johnny depps Willy Wonka tho
this better be prequel to Charlie and Chocolate factory not Willy Wonka and Slavery Factory
Damn the new Dune trailer looks crazy
I could cry tears of joy 
Didnt realize there were so many black people in early 20th Century England  Especially in Scotland Yard
From the director of the GREATEST film of all timePaddington 2
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD WHAT
I went into this fully NOT on board Now Im on board
THIS LOOKS HARD 
I can already tell Mr Beast will create a feastable to sponsor the wonka movie
Please please please make this a good one WB 
The oompas are going to steal the show
This movie will be definitely to little Tim Burtonish
ngl this dude got a british face
I hopefully its not a musical
This is way better than I ever expected
The only Willy Wonka i remember is Johnny Depp
no way the oompa loompa did the ice spice emote
This movie already looks magical
I didnt know rowan atkinson akamr bean in this movie 
Well that looks dumb
140 ROWAN ATKINSON
You can just FEEL all the damn Green screen my GOD WHY
Chalamet fits perfectly for this role
"Me Sees Wonka Trailer who would want to watch that
Me Sees from the director of Paddington I would want to watch that"
yeah this is gonna be amazing
Im sorry the people behind this are part of both Paddington AND Harry Potter Oh theres no damn way this movie isnt being a Certified Fresh on Rotten Tomatoes lol
Is this based on a true story
I cant believe theyre making a prequel to Snowpiercer
Oh its gonna be bad and Im not gonna miss this train wreck
From the trailer the mood atmosphere and acting are too different from Tim Burtons original film It seems more like a fairy tale for children with a primitive storyline Tims was more complex and with a unique style Well see but for now I dont want to see the gloomy Wonka turn into Paddington
theyve all been crushed by the chocolate cartel
They had me at the chocolate mafia
My God this looks unbearable
Nope Its not as good as it was Its not bad either I think
Another live action remake
Why do I get this weird Feeling this Movie isnt gonna be that good 
great
The fact that this was directed by the same guy who made Paddington Bear and the fact that this feels like it has the same tone as the OG film means that this will be an absolute incredible prequel RIP Gene Wilder
No thanks
Im interested in the chocolate cartel
Nah this aint it Gene Wilder spoiled us all
Haters mad that they cant experience childlike Whimsy
no
please kill me this is the only thing i wanted  my lifes purpose is fulfilled now 
Timothee fits good as Willy Wonka ngl
i thought it was gonna say how willy became silly
Sally Hawkins need more recognition love her as an actress Also good to see Jim Carter Rowan Atkinson and Hugh Grant
Woke and Cringe
IM SO EXCITED
The casting is good for the most part but theres problems It appears the flick is yet another that will fail because ifs trying to send a message instead of trying to tell a satisfying story
Produced by Diabetes
So this is not the story of Charlie Bucket This is now Willy Wonkas story
here we go lets name the title of the movie the last name of the main character
Yes hes finally back
"You know I was feeling Charlie and the Chocolate Factory needed a prequel
Now we have one in works hyped"
my childhood heart is healed
I like the part where Wonka puts a pinch of spice melange into a chocolate recipe and he has a vision of leading the Oompa Loompas on a genocidal Jihad across the known universe
No one can match Johnny Depp as Willy Wonka 
Yes black people everywhere in 19th century england
Timothee is so hot
i LOVEEEE timothee but let the original lie no more wonkas
ANOTHER ONE

Leaked wonka concept images in 2018  filming began in 2021 and now an official trailer in 2023 I dont know how people are just now finding out about this
This finna be LIT
Hugh Grant deserves an oscar
Exited 
Now this looks good 
Lets go
This kinda reminds me of Charlie and the chocolate factory
Its just me or theres no volume
This film will hit but Johnny depps Willy Wonka will be always remembered
Nobody asked for this Nobody wants this
im going to vomit
Dude I love the willy wonka movies growing up I cant wait to see this one
I feared for itand now I WANT TO SEE IT Timothe appears to be perfectly cast
the fact this comes out just one month after Dune part 2 just shows the incredible acting versatility Timothee has
Johnny Depp Cameo
"Rowan Atkinson

Bruh"
This is coming out at a perfect time for the holiday season Made by people with great track records a solid cast plus its always good to see Rowan Atkinson involved Whether it comes together well remains to be seen but it looks to be an interesting prequel and the trailer did its job well
Lets go
"
  "
Yeah no this is attached to neither Chocolate Factory movie Not the second outing since the Oompa Loompas didnt have orange skin and definitely not the original since Willi Wonka specifically stated that he brought the Oompa Loompas there But yet it appears as if one of them justfinds him
Hes good Too good Yup I agree Cant wait till Christmas
looks WOKE Go Woke Go Broke
yippee
The ONLY reason Id watch this is to see Hugh grant as an Oompa loompa 
"come with me and youll see in a world of pure imagination  Take a look and youll see
Into your imagination"
Excited
Roald Dhal and Gene Wildman have just rolled over 
So glad its a prequel to the 1971 film Im not a fan of the 2005 version
Please no Just no 
Cant wait
LIFE STORY OF WILLY WONKA Before the chocolate factory whats Next Wizard of Oz just call it Oz 
lookslike am watching a disney movie in warner bros production
Im just happy to see an Oompa Loompa
Damn I dont expect someone like Hugh grant is oompa loompa
MR BEAN THE VICAR LOL
We need more of the OG Score 
Yeah Im definitely going to see this
Okay but Timothee is perfect for the role of Willy Wonka
Oopa loompa
This looks so joyous Im in
Timothe Chalamet went from a dark batmanlike spaceman to a mickey mouse chocolate maker in the same year
Hugh Grant as OOmpa Loompa is a great addition
Johnson from Peep Show being in this is clearly the main draw
         
Wanka
Nice  flm
Heres another reason to keep living until the end of the year
My Willy Wonka is always Johnny Depp 
"This seems like a really interesting movie
But uh Im kinda confused how would Wonka even change their lives"
This looks terrible
 he dont have that wonka energy
whos willin their wonkers right now after watching this trailer
Rowan Atkinson 
the oompa loompa is more believable than the amount of blacks in the fictional London Hard pass on this movie
It look so weirdi love it
Not everything has to be Timothy Shallamay
Run away favourite part on this trailer
doompety doo
""
Looks wholesome
Itll be pretty cool if they have Charlies grandpa be a side character or even just make a brief cameo
so what happens to the girl then he ditches her in the future Makes no sense and neither does the mother storyline
is that mr bean ahhhhhhhh
this actually looks amazing
Oh my Godddddd
Rowan Atkinson and Olivin  colman  wow nice castings
excited asf omg
Timothy Chalamet is an incredible actor so I dont know why this feels so off
Hollywood cant come up with something original to save their life Just endless rape of old IPs Cant wait for prequel sequel 37 Member berries are heroin for creatively bankrupt studios
Omg this is real  Im gonna crazy whit this omg  Wonka is back im so excited 
I loved it when Wonka said With great chocolate comes great responsibility truly the most movie moment ever made
I am more excited about the fact theres Rowan Atkinson and Key in this movie
Since weve never gotten a Willy WonkaCharlie Bucket sequel Im kinda down for prequel Im curious to see how Willy Wonka got started
Timothe Chalamet playing Wonka is all I need in life
Wonkanda
Miss Johnny Depp
""
Its STRIKE that reverse it They couldnt even get THAT right
This is nowhere near as quirky as it thinks it is
ew why him
Looks incredibly mid
WAIT ROWAN IS IN THE FILM TOO
What I want from the originalis that Wonka had a bit of a sadistic side Also less cgi
Which universe is this supposed to be in Gene wilder Johnny depp or the book
Who up wonkin they willy
Uh oh I can already tell Rowan is gonna be the only good factor about this movie
This looks absolutely amazing and wonderful Need more Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa 
I mean it looks alright
This looks bad
MrBean
This actually looks pretty good I may just have to go to the theater for the first time since 2018 to go see it
Cant wait to hear what the songs sound like
I cant wait for the rest of the WCU the Wonka Cinematic Universe
Honestly I wasnt gonna pay any attention to this assuming it was just another cheap forced Hollywood reboot but I must say my interest has definitely been peaked Lets see what this has to offer
"You had my curiosity But NOW

you have my vested interest"
Johnny depp is the best willy wonka my favorite Johnny depp
he should have been an nonbinary POC this is unacceptable
looks good
"Pft so fake everyone knows chocolate doesnt make you fly




Mushrooms do that"
"I loved when he said its Wonking time and he pulled out his Willy Wonka and wonked everywhere

Truly a riveting experience"
Love seeing Rowan making a nod to monthy pyton
Yay a Rowan Atkinson movie
i never knew we would see a prequel to willy wonka im quite excited
I dont think this kid fit for this role It just feels like hes  trying so hard to be funny and energetic
Thank you WB Youre the best
Phenomenal
Still am missing Johnny Depp
So Willy Wonka meets Mary Poppins a combination I never knew I needed
103 Rowan Atkinson
"Damn theres something to be said about the power of a good trailer

I wasnt really looking forward to this movie But whether its the whimsical tone the lively production design or Chalamets surprisingly good performance I knew the guy was a terrific actor but I figured a role with such an iconic precedent would be difficult to follow up Im quite excited by this film now"
Lol Rowan Atkinson at 141
I wont be watching this since this ACTOR says JK Rowling is a transphobia And he calls everyone TERFS if they support her by playing Hogwarts Legacy
Primer comentario en espaol 
lmao Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
Cant wait to watch Wonka 
this actually looks good
That explains everything why spies came after wonkas secrete recipe for great chocolate the chocolate cartel   Wait
I clicked this 100 prepared to click back out partway through Chalamets current oversaturation everywhere studios choosing the cheap creepy factor over creativity etcbut this looks super fun  sign me up
Hoping we see Wonka enslave all the Oompa Loompas
I dont understand why hollywood cant make new stories anymore  its aaaall about a prequel then a sequel  then a show in the last years its sad
Loved it when he said Its Wonka Time
I dont know why it is seen as so offensive to portray the Oompa Loompa as per the original material That is some variant of African pygmy native Would it be racially offensive to tell the Marco Polo story and show Asians from Asia I know Wonka is fiction but
Not sure about this one
Of course the kid he hangs out with is a black femaleSJWs wouldnt have it any other way
I didnt think I would like it much but it seriously looks awesome
This is kinda cringe
This shows that Timothee is really growing as an actor Im actually proud of him
BRUHHHHH THE OOMPA LOOMPA 
Here we go They ruined another great movie Well done Money talks WB IS A DISGRACE
im glad they used the oompa loompas from the orginal and not the remake
The only person caught my eye here is Mr Bean Rowan Atkinson Even if I saw him for only 2 seconds in the whole video
So glad to see Hugh Grant playing something so close to his true self
I was skeptical at first but boy we will be seated
wtf is this
So we went from Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory to Willy Wonka to just Wonka I cant wait for the next release in 10 years called W
141 Was that Rowan Atkinson aka Mr Bean
omg Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa though
"Timothee is definitely one of the best actors of his generation I cant wait for this movie It just fits the Christmas spirit 
Damn we are in the middle of summer and Im already thinking about Christmas"
How cute lol
Que mierda es esto
THIS LOOKS EFFING AWESOME OMG
I wont be watching This sucks
Im surprised they didnt get Ezra miller as wonka would seem a bit more fitting with his character grooming kids and all
bro where is jony dep helooo
Every time I see Timothe Chalamet in a movie I see a young actor trying to play a character as opposed to someone embodying their character I may be in the minority but there are far more talented young actors than him He always comes off a bit too community theater
Willy wonka
Cest un conte pour les Enfants  attention  lindigestion de Chocolat Wonka    
Mr Beast now laughing is corner Sikeee Ive already done that
June Its chocolate
who asked for this
oh 
Ugh he is so overrated
its finally here and it looks amazing Timothee Chalamet is gonna do great in this and in Dune part two
crazehhhhhhhhhhh
The movie I never thought I needed
Call me crazy but this looks absolutely amazing
When I saw that is was going to be directed by the same person for Paddington I knew this movie was in good hands
Wasnt sure about this until the Chocolate Cartel just attempted to murder two people by drowning them in chocolate
They shouldve cast mr beast
best moment when Wonka Said  its wonkaning time and started wonkaning all over the place
Stop the remakes
Mathew Baynton
Acting looks overacting ngl over all is good
Nothing like Jhonny depp
Nothing will event be as good as Johnny Depp version  This seems to Disneyed  The guy playing Wonka literally looks like your average boring white Vanilla bar  boring  Wonka is suppose to be weird  mad man  mix emotions  something magical not this boring white guy
Is this the start of the Roald Dahl Cinematic Universe
wowooowowowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwowwoowowowowowwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwwww
i see mr bean im coming for this
The Snowpiercer prequel nice
Cinema
Rowan Atkinson sold it for me
I see where modern movie writers creativity is going
New Cinematic Golden Age emerging
this looks 4ss
Since Mathew Baynton is in this film and Simon Farnaby cowrote the film I wonder if any more Horrible Histories members will make a surprise appearance
""
Snowpiercer is the sequel and now we have prequel
Feels like hes trying to mimic Depps portrayal of Vonka This light madness is visible in him
2023 is looking like a good year for movies
I didnt expect this coming So excited
For some reason I cant see Willy Wonka but only Timothe in character I hope the film is actually different because its very important to separate a character from the actor They couldve done some makeup on him to change how he looked or done SOMETHING so he didnt look so Timmy I guess it might be a good or a bad thing will just have to wait and see
"Imagine trying to do a role that was perfected by noneother than Johnny Depp 
Willy Wonka would always be a masterpiece of Roald Dahl that would eternally remain in many of our generation  90s  early 2000s generation
Looks promising hopefully Timothee  the team could deliver this art the way its supposed to be"
Cant wait 
Is this the only actor available Why is nepotism not working for the others and all the movies keep going to this same guy
weird
Timothee chamalet or whatever he gonna kill this role
Okay this looks good
Anyone else notice that Willy Wonka is almost always played by Americans in adaptations
damn
When creativity is lost this is what happens
ah nostalgia hits hard this time with thimothie lets hope it would be good
Definitely interesting but kind of ruins the mystery of gene wilders character in the original once you know his backstory
i love willy wonka so much dude
It seems like Charlie and the chocolate factory doesnt it
never thought that on my 30s  im gonna be so excited to watch MR Willy Wonka once again
Been waiting for this for a long time
The mad manic genius of Gene Wilder will never be matched but you have to hand it to them here  it looks like theyre really going for broke
PERIOD STINKKKK
"This looks so whimsical I absolutely love it 
And having the director of Paddington makes it even better because those movies are awesome"
this looks absolutely terrible
wtf r these botted comments
All these people saying its going to be great and Im just thinking this looks awful
The spice melange hitted Paul Atreides harder than spected this time
MATHEW BAYNTON HELLO MY CHILDHOOD1232
wow im in This looks magical
Nice A prequel to Snowpiercer
Ah why do we need this
Rowan Atkinson  nice 
This dune guy again He missed the stage
"Wonka Ive spent the past 7 years traveling perfecting my craft 

Me So youve been perfecting your craft since you were 8"
I dont like a love line For what We know that he is lonely genius She helped him with everything believed from the begging and to the Chocolate Factory story she left him In a book his only one love was a factory Always
Leo tamil FANSCHOCLATE
IVE BEEN WAITING THIS FOR SO LONG
KeeganMichael Key is going to do great in this 
Is this a prequel to the 2005 movie
the piccolo flute was an appreciated bustout
You know  its been a Terrible  Run for Movies when they bring out These IPs 
"I had doubts but OMFG
I am SOLD"
A lot of these comments make my brain hurt
That was enjoyable
Did we need a Wonka origin story
Looks terrible
Are we sure Chris Columbus didnt direct this  Cause this movie gives me Harry Potter 2001 vibes
Something that I didnt know I wanted and yet I never thought wouldve existed Count me in for this Willy Wonka origin
who up wonking they willy rn
nka
Why
I was iffy until the Oompa Loompa nostalgiad me back in time with that instrument and made me laugh
Once we have started we cant stop
Everything looks amazing except Tims shallow performance
This might be hit or miss but Ill still check it out
Just leave Roald Dahl alone  Hes given enough to our collective imaginations to have people who despise him continue to harvest his ideas and sully them with their insipid takes
omg omg omg omg omg omg omg 
Those reboots need to stop
Rowan Atkinson nice this will be a hit for sure
141 bean
Whait is that the actor of mr bean in this movie
Was not expecting this film but it looks intriguing Might check it out
The original Oompa Loompa is back
omggggg
shoutout to Matther Baynton from Horrible Histories 134
Hes not Him
Color me interested I actually watch the trailer via Cartoon Network Africas Channel
Timothy 
Que hermoso la verdad soy fan de la versin de Jhonny y esto es diferente y me gusta
Its absolutely Glorious
Wow no way this is now gonna be a movie
He will not be as good as Gene Wilder but I hope this movie is good
"Why would you possibly make this

Two words Gene Wilder Leave the franchise alone"
"Stop the reboot remake prequel thing

MAKE  NEW  STUFF"
por que poner a gente color   por que   que necesidad
Oh man this movie looks so much fun looking forward to watch it
102 Is that rowan atkinson Damn I need to watch this
Cant wait to see this movie because I like the other 2 Willy wonka movies and I think I might like this one as well
 
Willy Woke
Ah yes So Willy Wonka has to take a stand against the evil German chocolate conglomerate and their evil german chocolates because they are German it seems What a refreshing and totally new idea
"Dune 2 in November 
Wonka this Christmas 
I see you Timothe"
this looks awful
Looks fun  I will probably watch it
Rowan atkinson
I thought he found the oompa loompas in a forest tribe place
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was not something I expected but I am gladly here for
 
i dont know how i fell bout this
Since theres no Feastables I aint watchin
Yo
Daniel Thrasher is Willy Wonka
This looks so good but Timothee as Willy Wonka Why the deadfaced twink why
Honestly this looks better than what I thought
High Grant as an Oompa Loompa seems oddly perfect
Lily RoseDepp must the only person in the world that can say that her dad and her ex are Willy Wonka
Those last few seconds killed me 
Looks horrible
Im absolutely obsessed with Hugh Grants career choices these days What a legend
Its a musical
Cinema in 2023 is starting to be something else best since 2014
I may be in the minority on this but this looks absolutely insufferable
It looks incredible cant wait to see Timothe in a very different role 
I wish we could see Johny here at least as a side character
141 its good to see Mr Bean again
This looks so charming Im actually looking forward to this
"The Chocolate Cartel
Im already in love with the movie"
106 wait is that
ROWAN ATKINSON 
Good but not to close johnney depp
"Paul Atreides LONG LIVE THE FIGHTERS
Willy Wonka Oh dont be such a grump Here have some chocolate Have you ever seen a FLYING spice worm"
Another movie we didnt need
Oh look its The Little Mermaid again
Love Timothe but enough with the remakes prequels and sequels Lol
omg paddington is one of my favorite movies ever so excited for this
054 is such an epic bone chilling reveal The soundtrack is epic Cant wait for the movie
A prequel to the original 1971 classic and its coming out during the holiday season Oh this is gonna be a delicious treat
Spiderverse sequal lookin wild
They cant come up with new ideas they keep recycling old movies 
oh boy another dumb origin story by warner of course it is
Sweet unadulterated consumerism just like Roald Dahl  Gene Wilder always dreamed 
Woke
okay but im sure this will turn out amazingbut i still cant picture willy wonka being played by anyone except johnny 
IM SO EXCITED FOR THISSS
inget kan sl jonny deep tyvr
Is this a prequel to the old film or the 2005 film
Here we go Momma 
I didnt think Id be interested in this at all but it honestly looks really good
johnny depp better
"I really like the official trailer for Wonka and I am looking forward to seeing it on the big screen at the Cinema in December
WonkaMovie"
Im really sorry if Im being negative but ANOTHER ONE  SERIOUSLY 
The movie no one asked for
Why was I convinced the little guys were called Gronka Lonkas
Now well  have to explain the REAL WONKA to kids   Depp WONKA
Absolutely  amazing
Not inclusive enough Why is Hugh Grant playing an Oompa Loompa
"So we have now Hugempa Groompa 

Looks pretty good I assume this a prequel to the Depp Willy Wonka movie Ill watch this"
What  Again
2023 what are you A dream Omg
Finally a worthy competition to Johnny Depp
Mr Bean  103
Ive literally been waiting for this movie for my whole life
Wow this looks terrible Bad acting bad casting Ripping off Tim Burtons style Looks pretty dumbed down and safe for the masses so i get why people like it Cue that colgate ad
Really excited for this 
Ah another character ruined by the Hollywood shid machine
 142 Mr Bean Is Spotted
Y Johny depp
Its gonna be a 610 I can just tell
is this a prequel to the 70s one or the tim burton one or is its own thing
Omfg Timothee as Wonka 
Finally we get the Pennywise origin story we all wanted
I will spend money on a movie not owned by Disney simply out of spite for Indiana Jones Willow Star Wars and the collapse of the MCU into CW trash
208 OH NO YOU DIDNT 
This Dune sequel is so colorful After tasting chocolate the spice isnt so important anymore huh
That trailer was kinda wonky
"If you feel unloved just know that Jesus loves you that he gave his life for you so that you may be saved  God truly loves and cares for you
John 316"
I decided I was never going to see this but then I saw Hugh Grant as an oompa loompa
Is Wonka 2 going to focus on his descent into solitude and isolation prior to The Chocolate Factory This looks good but doesnt seem like the same Willie Wonka weve seen
Timothy is one of the most skilled young actors He has so much potential 
This just seems like a nice colorful imaginative movie with a talented cast having a lot of fun  I hope it does well Im rooting for this one
Let see if this movie will make 500 million 
Talk about the range of Timothee 
am glad its not a sequel but a origin story
I love the part when he said its wonking time Sent chills down my spine
Yikes
Finally a movie that feels like a movie
Is it just me or does like every remakeprequel just have the name of a character as its movie title
This looks cringe
Leo Vijay Anna in an Alternate Universe
    
The Oompa Loompa dancing 
Something else blacked up and ruined
Hopefully they address the historic  exploitation of Africans  by Europeans  in this chocolate  industry
Wonka  The Gen Z Prequel
Wow
Oh dear
Ok Im sold take my money
Hollywood has officially run out of ideas also the POC stick out like a sore thumb
I think Timmy has found his true breakthrough role this will be a big hit for WB at Christmas
This looks gorgeous Cant wait
ill check it i wonder if its a musical like the original kind a was
YOU LOSE
101 promise a pinky promise 
INTERESTING
this is gonna make me cry isnt it
The cocoa must flow
Is Hugh Grant going to be the highlight as an Oompa Loompa
I like how this is just acknowledging the craziness and is just having fun with it
You know Im Something of a Scientist Myself
WHO IS THIS FOR
They had me at Harry Potter 
Even Mr Bean Pulled up to Willy Wonkas shop
""
Nah
No
I see a holy war waged in 
Mr Bean
I was expecting a prequel to the books but not a prequel to the original movie u when that orchestrated version of Pure Imagination came ongoosebumps
Is this gonnna be a prequel
Oh wow a hot Willy Wonka 
This will be a musical right 
no daydreaming is the worst law ever
god that was awful
only Wonka I know is Michael Scott
"It looks so nice 
Expectations were created"
I CANNOT WAIT
Thank God for a little originality I just think Chalamet is just as overrated as Depp
Well NOW hes in everything
This looks absolutely awful if Im being honest Looking forward to watching Napoleon
I am watching this movie for Neil Hannons work
I dunno on paper this sounded great but this trailer gives me trying too hard vibes just like Fantastic Beasts So right now Im guessing good not great Well see Hugh looks amazing
he isnt weird enough was will poulter busy
Im in
103 MrBean is back
not sure about this one
all in a prequel is how you do it
Something feels bad about Timmys performance I think its a miscast His voice doesnt match Wonkas Sounds like hes trying too hard like hes cosplaying almost
Im loving this camp era of cinema
I have several questions one of my biggest questions is why does mr Wonka have a child assistant or little helper all of a sudden And why does the Oompa Loompa look CGI
""
Looks pretty grand but I hope WW will still have a bit of a mean streak Chalamets version seems too much like a hero from this trailer Hugh Grant as an Oompah Loompah is inspired casting Keegan Michael Key in a fat suit Mr Bean as a Priest Im in
Nah
No hate but i cant be the only one who thinks he does not make a good Willy Wonka
This looks AWFUL
103
Still think they shouldve called it willy instead
Why
This movie is going to be a hot mess and I look forward to seeing it
Didnt think I would want to watch this I was wrong lmao
trash
Ok did not know I needed Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa yet here we are
Scratch that reverse I love that Cant wait for this to come out
Anyone going to come out with something original anytime soon or just stale talentless spinoffs
""
what a terrible actor lmao
 count me in
This looks genuinely funny
I I dont know how to feel about this but Im smiling
Yeah Im hype to see this
 exciting
Why oh Why
Its a no from me dawg
Love Chalamet but he doesnt have this crazyness burning inside him that would make him a great Wonka
So we are getting a origin story and it only took 52 years and another 18 years for it to happen
OH YAYYYY
Looks incredible 
Ok if there was such a thing as a Daydream tax how many of yall would go bankrupt
"no one talking about the on screen script at the start if u put on captions it fills the whole screen
edit turns out my yt was glitching because other vids started doing that too"
   
""
Finally we got to see Willy Wonka origin story Timothee as Wonka is absolutely amazing
unhappy thing
You had me at Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa
That cast is stacked Also this has a magical vibe compared to the Tim Burton version that has a tinge of eeriness to it which is good too
Timothy Chocolate 
Go on then looks magical silly fun 
who wonking their willy rn
Ew no I hate Timothe Chalamet in the role Something about his line delivery sounds like hes trying too hard
Timothee doesnt feel right in this He looks the part but his line delivery doesnt feel like wonka to me
I just started watching Downton Abbey so I just screamed Mr Carson 
The thirsty ones can I have some chocolate 
Paul too high on that spice huh
Does not fit the character poor casting
Everything needs an origin these days
Timothee looks great as wonka 
The writing is absolutely terrible
Thanks I hate it
This looks stunning
oh he ate
Looks ok they could have done  a better job on the casting
MAKE SOMETHING NEW
038 Cool
wait Chalamet is the new Johnny Depp
Alright consider me surprised
Idk Timothee Chalamet just doesnt have that wacky charisma thats associated with Willy Wonka
Wonderful 
Paul King is the director say no more
The trailer we didnt ask for but desperately needed Cant wait for this
He seems incredibly wooden and wrong for the role
OH NO HES HOT
sheesh
When House Atreides was destroyed by the harkonnens Paul decided to escape in a faraway planet to sell some chocolates
Ngl this movie seems to childish but ill check it out when it releases
this looks so amazing definitely one ill be seeing in theaters
"Please no Not another remakereboot
Nothing will ever be better than the 1971 film starting Gene Wilder"
Man I just love the soundtrack of in a world of your imagination makes me want to look back on the first time I saw that Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory trailer and that was from a Pokmon the movie 3 VHS previews
This looks amazing and hugh grant as a Oompa loompa is great
Is this the prequel of the one from the 70s
Now we have know that the chocolate secret recipe is SPICE
aww this kinda cute I cant wait to watch it on tiktok in 46 2min clips
Oh boy  another reused idea 
No
I love the idea but this looks like a huge miss to me starting with casting Chalamet as Wonka
haha cant stop watching Hugh Grant at the end
Ugh Completely missing the point of what Charlie and the Chocolate Factory is
I was iffy but seeing Hugh Grant as a oompa loompa really changed my mind
This looks really good
Mmmmnmn Pass looks like fun but it can never be as good as the original
When I saw this trailer I was like thinking of saying if I were the subtitles of the previews saying of the story that brought you Willy Wonka and the chocolate factory and Charlie and the chocolate factory brings you the story of the origin of Willy Wonkas life
not this CGI cheap
i cant imagine anyone other than johny depp as willy wonkabut this looks good
i just dont think timothee is meant to be willy wonka
YOU LOSEGOOOOOD DAY SIR
It looks like an incredible adventure but I always think back to the original movie and laugh XD This provides a whole new perspective on the mans character
Oh
This looks positively annoying
i will never forget the moment my heart stopped reading the miracle WOW
I gotta be honest not was I was expecting I was expecting a retelling of the classic Charlie story but another origin story is cool I guess
you bastards went casted hugh grant as an oompa loompa thats dastardly and vile I know where Im going to be on december 15
This is DISNEY movie
Way to cover up the historically neglected Oompa Loompa slavery that contributed so much
It would be great to see how he spiraled into the creepy yet charming looney unhinged guy that he became I want this movie to scar me or at least make me bawl in tears
Did anyone else smile when that particular tune came from the flute of the OompaLoompa
Well looking forward to it Its a family friendly adventure movie so yeah
Finally a movie that actually might have some real majestic in it
The Oompa Loompa CGI looks worse than Sanic Hope they fix it
Anythings better than that awful Johnny Depp Wonka attempt
""
Spasibo Thank You 
Hugh Grant will be great in this
his performance seems kinda hollow idk im not sold on this
Hugh Grant a Oompa Loompayou have my attention
Wow this looks like trash Ill stick to the original
Hugh Grant As an Oompa Loompa
Great casting but its got that same on a soundstage feel as the Nutcracker or these live action Disney remakes like Mary Poppins
Wait Mr Bean became a priest and can talk now Wow 
Lets give it a chance
I hope this will be better than the one of Johnny Depp Because I like the prequel of the one of Gene Wilder
Chocolate  016
What a surprise  Cant wait to watch it in Theater
Im sooo excited I use love Willy wonka when I was younger 
Hope post credit scene maybe five main children characters born
Got to watch some of this get filmed since it was in my city interested to see if I can tell which scenes I witnessed when the whole film happens haha
This feels more like a Disney movie than any Disney movie in the last few years
Mr Bean as a priest 
wow
this is terrible
So is this a biopic on a fictional character Extra points for thinking outside the box at least
I never thought a Willy Wonka prequel was necessary But I gotta admit this looks quite good And Timothee is very talented
what on earth i dont know whether to be happy or sad lmao
Okay first Warner Bros made the Barbie movie trailers and took over the world now theyre dropping this Step aside Disney I think Warner is coming for your spot
How many times we gonna redo wonka
Not everyone gets how talented Timothe is
lesssgooooooooooooo
"103  141
                         
                          The legend"
I hate that this looks so good and I cant wait to see it
A Willy wonka moviehow original
THIS IS LOVELY ON SO MANY LEVELS CANT WAIT TO PARK IT IN THE CINEMA 4 CHRISTMAS
This is the Gene Wilder Prequel not Johnny Depp right
MATHEW BAYNTON 
I heard about this film some time ago but now watching the trailer is interesting me in how the film will turn out
Roald Dahl would be proud
""
Cest dla merde
"Timothe is the perfect mix of Gene Wilder  Johnny Depp 

Wonka seems as whimsical as Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory As dark  poignant as Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  has hints of The Greatest Showman  Paddington

Im far more excited for this than Dune p2"
If Hallywood wants to pay ransom to black people and make half of the actors black it is better to pay attention to the fact that the people of other countries where there is not even a black person among them do not have to tolerate them
So are they going for the Gene Wilder Wonka or Johnny Depp Wonka
Hes like a combination of Johnny Depp and Gene Wilder O
FINALLY
No
Having to Big Up the producer in the trailer is never a good sign for a good movie just the amount of money thats gone into it
tbh I cant wait to see Hugh Grants scenes in the movie
nice to see rowan atkinson back
This is gonna be so good 
Bring back jonny Depp
Are all of these comments paid for Not saying this looks bad per se but whos the audience for this
Timothy is such an arrogant actor He seems really full of himself
First dune 2 and now willy wonka 2023 cant get any better
New movie to be hyped about
Timothee Chalamet can nail any role Even tho I am not a fan of prequels I can see this has potential
So this Willie Wonka is essentialy Daniel Thrasher in a hat
hot
This looks dead inside And timothee does not due whimsical very well
This is going to be great and just absolutely magical Cannot wait to see Timmy as Wonka
I was very unsure about this at first but now this looks alot better than I thought definitely seeing this great nod at the end to the gene wilder wonka with the oompaloompa
Directed and written by the man who made paddington Its gonna be a masterpiece
the hugh grant oompa loompa is so unserious i support it
Wah its finally  back charlie and the chocolate factory when I was born in 2005 and now when Im 18 Wonka  I love it 
Im not feeling it TT
Timothe Chalamet
again another one
I dont think i dont wanna hear that too late
This looks really good
y augustoclub
That actually looks good I had my doubts not gonna lie
Having only seen Timothee take on serious roles its kinda weird yet incredibly refreshing to see him take on boyish and whimsy roles instead Id def watch this for Christmas
The original film is a classic and I feel that I enjoy Depps version more than most But even with that said I have to wonder what else can be done with this character 
I like how hes more similar to the original Wonka portrayed by Gene Wilder Depps version was creepy while Wilders was charming and whimsical You can tell thats what the director was going for as the Oompa Loompa is the 1971 version
This looks good Even though I have never watched ANY Wonka movies
Who up willying they wonka rn
The cast oh my god
From the director of Paddington  and the producers of Harry Potter 
this looks like my bloody stool
"Wonka  I am something of a magician

Norman  ur parents must be proud"
It looks terrible and anyone older than 13 knows it
Looks pretty good
If this movie were directed by anyone else but Paul King itd look really hokey But this movie looks so delightful and fun Cant wait to hear the songs
Timothe Chalamet 
Ohok
Shouldve had wonka from TikTok play willy wonka
Never thought Id see Timothee Chalomet and Rowan Atkinson in one movie Can we acknowledge how much Tim has grown as an actor though
This really looks good except one thing Its visible quite clearly that Timothee Chamalet is not upto the job and is phoning his performance in Its all the more jarring considering how good Johnny Depp was in the Tim Burton adaptation was Everything else looks awesome but I think Timothees poor performance may break this movie for those of us who grew up on Johny Depp or any adult who notices Bad acting
Cant be worse than the Tim  Burton one Hopefully
early
 D
Discover the became 121523 in IMAX  dolby cinema
Ill sure see it The start of a world of pure imagination   
If someone saw Rowan Atkinson at the trailer please give me the timestamp thank you
Oh no
Would have preferred Paddington 3 but itll be worth keeping an eye on merely for director Paul King Not entirely convinced by the CG Hugh Grant Oompa Loompah but its definitely got more charm than a dozen Disney remakes 
I like how its now lore that the oompa loopmas have to finish the song and dance once they start Like its built into their instincts more than something they like to do
This shows how chamaleonic timmy can be I love this
This looks terrible
Trasshhhhhh 
Charles the second is that you
I enjoyed the Paddington movies  Since the Paddington director is making this this could be good
"Hate to be so negative 
but honestly the CGI doesnt look that appealing 
and Timothee Chalamet ONLY by the trailer isnt that convincing 
ill be the minority but I think he is overrated 
Amazing in call me by your name
and mediocre with the rest
Sorry "
Ok you have my attention as this does look better than I expected it to be
johnny should attend the wonka premiere
I like the part where he enslaves an entire species lmfao
Spotted some huge musical numbers there
I like that the Ooompa Loompas stay true to the original movies version
will be a hit
Please dont butcher it again
This looks absolutely stunning Is anyone else getting greatest showman vibes from this
Hugh Grant is oompa loompa  Im dying
Ahsoka and Wonka trailers dropping at the same time wasnt on my bingo card for the year but here we are
Wonder if Tim Burton gets involved in this movie
Miss you Jhonny Depp 
Not Hugh Grant as oompa loompa
Im so glad they oompa loompa right I like Johnny Depp version but nothing beats the classics
This turned out better than i expected
This film looks like an EXPERIENCE
LETS GOOOO
This looks promising
Why does this need to exist Who was asking for this 
Hard Pass
"Wait wtf why does this look amazing 

Its like a youthful Wilder plus a notannoying Depp Why is this doing it for me"
Somehow I remember Michael Scott from The Office
There better be a series of Wonka candy tie ins for this movie
17 MINS AGO DJJSHSGS
Is that Johnson from Peep Show What a legend
Wow thats wow my childhood movie cant waitt
2023 will be remembered as Timothes year
I dont know Rick looks decent but somethings telling me Im gonna hear the Rock Dwayne Johnson sayin his meme phrase after the release 
ehh
Yo this looks hype
Hugh grant
why this movie feels like 10 years old
Like a sad parody
I thought this was darker version but no
I hope this can live up to Depps Wonka and even compliment it Im confident in it doing so because Timothe Chalamet is a phenomenal actor one of the greatest of this time and his generation 
My favorite scene was when Willy Wonka said May thy chocolate chip and shatter Truly one of the Wonka moments of all time
The Hughmpa Lumpa
I love how this is closer to Gene Wilders Wonka than the Burton film Especially with the perfect mix of both Oompa Loompas
Wait the chocolate guys getting a movie And the short masked wears underwear as a costume guy doesnt have one 
I JUST WONKED
This looks like it could be the most accuratelooking Willy Wonka movie ever made I mean it fuses perfectly the Gene Wilder film with a more Roald Dahl  Quentin Blake zany style so I just love this with every single cell in my body
Going for a lastname title sounds like its gonna be super gritty But Im intrigued by what I see
Damn Oppenheimer Napoleon and now wonka What a year for movies
he just doesnt look crazy enough
Looks like were finally going to get another great live action kids film I hope
Wonka was a Black Transgender Sheman This is blasphemy
Ser Pelo menos eu no me impressionou
Another remake
Finally Theyre showing us some footage of this new origin story of Wonka
Movie looks good but I think Chalamet feels forced in this role
So fatigued
Looks funs and whimsical as it should be
im seated
The story behind the great Willy Wonka before the mighty chocolate factory Genius
Token black actress
Am impressed
Oh Ive been waiting for this one
I cant wait
Mrbeast version of Willy Wonka is better than this
meh
This looks pretty good
We dont get much whimsical children fantasy movies anymore Its almost refreshing
SCREAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM
I never expect to see Hugh Grant What a treat 
Love this 
It looks so good
timotheeeee
Why does the oompa loompa look like lord farquaad
If I ever watch this movie it will be because of Rowan Atkinson
Yikes this looks so bad
            
aaaa my Timothee love love  love
Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa 
Skip First he ruins Dune Paul Atreides  a mamas boy and now hes after Wonka Whats next Casablanca
""
Im so excited
Johnny depp is best willy wonka
"Director of Paddington

Alright im on board"
Timothe is truly the icon of this generation I was waiting for him to showcase his campy side Will be front row on premiere night
Looking forward to this one
NO
Hes good Timmy Tim Hes gorgeous
Im shocked that Willy Wonka is white  in this movie
amazing 
I seriously wasnt expecting too much I went from a curious click to Oh snap Ill go see that for sure
Cant lie Willy Wonka needs to be at least slightly psychotic
Is it just me or I still find willy wonka as lowkey scary
Diversity police Too many white people Give him a random minority sidekick 
why cant we make new videos instead of making worse versions of a good movie
Screaming crying throwing up
The goat rowan atkinson  the mr bean itself it is in the movie
The chocolate cartel lol
These dune lore are getting out of hand
He aint Johnny Depp
already saw it Dave
As the trailer went on I actually started to think it didnt look half bad Its kind of funny though how we already kind of got a prequel in Charlie with Johnny Depps version Im wondering if this will be completely different or if he will still have issues with his father Also I thought I heard a bit of pure imagination in theusic but if I am mistaken it definitely needs to be in the final movie
Cant wait
Willy wonka is getting a prequel
God this looks PERFECT No surprise its from the director of Paddington
Woahhhhh Breathtaking Timmys first Oscar
DID ANYONE SEE MATTHEW BAYTON OMG
That Oompa Loompa caught me off guard and is sending me 
again
Wow Im actually really excited for this
Aaaa I cant wait to see it
This looks absolutely charming and delightful A breath of fresh air in a time where movies are often SOOO serious
Amazing 
"Isso vai ser muito nostlgico de ver
"
I never thought a Willy Wonka movie would look this good
I am so excited I cant handle it 
I have never felt so much wonder and magic from a trailer like this one my eyes opened wide and I was overwhelmed with delight and imagination and I started tearing up this is going to be something special cant wait
Theres nothing better in cinema than a prequel  origin story 
I hope its not too late for me to be an oompa loompa
The oompa loompas 
This is going to lose so much money
Paul Atreides in another universe
""
Gotta remakeinvent that movie to keep the bookmovie rightscontract
oh my this is so special for the holidays
As soon I read Wonka I knew this movie was going to be about Willy Wonka
Is really crazy
who else wonking they willy rn
        
Looks like a joy
140 Mr Bean Talks
""
Happy to Rowan Atkinson again mrbean  140
welcome back village roadshow pictures
Definitely this is THE MOVIE for THESE CHRISTMAS Its what the cinema needed at this time magic and fantasy 
And ALL was forgotten by the time Charlie came around No one could remember flying people massive dance numbers in the street or Wonkas eccentric personality
Ive always wanted to watch a movie with two of my favorites Timothee Chalamet and chocolate
"Box Office Predictions

 150M
 375M"
Timothe Chalamet is gonna be real busy with Dune Part Two and Wonka being released one month apart
Paul Atreides hasnt been the same since Dune
This is going to be better than expected
Whoa this looks exciting
Chocolate Cartel haha
Willy Wonka Is Back
Finally something different in narrative
wonka dating kylie jenner is crazy
There should be a Wonka Chocolate Factory theme park
Ehnot really feeling it
A wonka origin story is exactly what I needed
okay but whoever picked timothee deserves a raise
Timothy Chalmette is really trying to be the next Johnny Depp and I gotta say its working of course he is not there yet
my favorite part was when Wonka said Scratch that reverse it ti esrever dna ti pilf nwod gnaht ym tup I
Vocal
GOD
I wasnt onboard for another remake but a prequel is different Stoked
Must admit i really looked forward to the movie but i didnt like this Mary Poppins style and the wizarding world magic from the candy Only thing that saved the trailer for me was the end with Hugh Grant as an Oompa loompa
I never knew a Willy Wonka prequel is what we needed 
Never thought Id see the movie where Timothee Chalamets role is allowed to be happy 
Cant wait for this one What a year for movies 
I already know that Hugh Grant is gonna be my favorite part of the movie
Didnt they just make a Wonka remake
This looks like a CGI dumpster fire In the immortal words of Lindsay Ellis Thanks I hate it
Timothee Chalamet is a fantastic actor probably the best one from his generation
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Timothee Chamalamadingdong should stick to dune
Just imagine Wonka boning miss Kylie Jenner 
Hugh grant as an Oompa Loompa 
WOW  Im sold  This looks like a fun movie for the family
How woke is this movie
not the biggest fan of Chalomet but maybe ill give this a chance
"I heard that Tom Holland auditioned for the role of Willy Wonka but I know Timothee will do great too RIP to Gene Wilder who originally played Willy Wonka in Willy Wonka and the  Chocolate Factory

Johnny Depp was a great Willy Wonka too

Cant wait to see this movie though

Also at 014 it was so nice to see Warner Bros  Village Roadshow Pictures working together again"
This looks sooo awesome
"You know Im something of a magician inventor and chocolatemaker myself

                                                                                                           Willem Dafoe"
This looks absolutely magical and I cannot wait
Just No
Vocal
Same movie as Dune Part 2
Me being happy cause I saw Rowan Atkinson
Mary Wonpins
I love chocolates 
This being produced by the producer of Harry Potter only has me more convinced Willy Wonka is a wizard in the HP world 
Que aburrido va a ser un musical
Jonhny deep still better
I love the part when he said its Wonka time Sent chills down my spine
Carson from downton abbey
Willy Wonka
Hugh Grant and his ever more silly little roles hahahaha I love it
this is really bad OO why is there a random chick with him too this is gonna flop
This is what cinema is all about

This looks pretty mid but because its an overrated actor people will pretend its amazing
Love love love this
Looks interesting but 210 ugh

Movie Vocals
wow a masterpiece
This is pure imagination 
AMAZING
ugh nope
looks so good but i have mixed feelings Wonka will always be Johnny Depp
Vocal Movie
TE AMO TIMOTHEE 
Ahhhhhhhhhh
Meh
I dunno Doesnt look like its going to have the disturbing edginess of the original It looks like every other PC kids movie they make these days Hopefully Im wrong And I still dont really know why Willy Wonka gave his chocolate factory away to Charlie while he was still in his prime Was he dying
Its damn good
Vocal
Damn can they come up with any other concepts So tired of them remaking the same movies
This will be sweet
Why is Timmy talking like Alyssa Edwards
Vocal
High grant as an oompaloompa sold it for me
"Ok you got me Im looking forward to this

Even though I more prefer Burtons movie cuz it adapts the book better i still enjoy the Gene Wilder one and this one is like a mix of both "
this is gonna be amazing
I did not expect this
Sometimes I wish Hollywood can leave classics alone
Wow Wonka movie looks like a lot of fun and awesomeness rolled into one So cant wait
This doesnt look too bad I did like the previous 2 Willy Wonka films with Gene Wilder and Johnny Depp and the MrBeast video that he did last year Ill watch it
Shouldve called it Willy
Im not sure what everyone thinks looks good about this Please explain for me and Im going to rewatch the original and read the book again to see why this looks good Im assuming these are the bots
Seems so good i just want Jhonny depth in a scene
"I think this looks good i like the different variations of Willy Wonka Gene Wilder was more self aware and sarcastic Johnny Depp was more needed and a strange and now Timothy 
Looks good cant wait"
Christmas is gonna be the best month for Wonka ever 
Love so much
So many good movies this year looks great 
Was really hoping for a little snippet of Timmy singing Oh well maybe next trailer
TIMMYYYY I MISSED YOU
I Wasnt That Hyped For This At All But After Seeing This Trailer Im All In For A Willy Wonka Prequel  Now And Cant Wait To See It Unfold 
""
Johnny Depp was the best Willy Wonka ever
SHAKING
The movie looks amazing I cant wait for it to be released in theaters 3
im pretty sure that Timothe is the most handsome man in the world
Once Again I somehow predicted a trailer
Why did it have to have the fantasy flying element Hmmmm
nah we didnt need this
Look at the magical
Timothee Chalamet will OWN the role
Is that Mr Mosby from Suite Life
Willy Wonkas origin a perfect prequel
"I think they just cast the oompa loompa just right
He cracks me up"
Finally another willy wonka
Oh this is gonna be a huge success Millions will wanna see this just to see Timothe and another millions just so they can experiencing childlike wonderment again And Im here for both
Depp Timothee ur acting so natural
Wonka but in his earliest life looks interesting
Who up wonking their Willy  rn
Hugh Grant and the scratch that line are kinda witty the rest looks very ordinary very subPotter
Why Paul Muaddib Atreides here
Im definitely watching this movie 
What Charlie imagined as Grandpa Joe told him Wonkas story
timothees versatility is crazy well be the johnny depp for the new generation
Checked out as soon as Keagan Michael Key showed up 
CAN DECEMBER COME FASTER ALREADY
I love Timmy and Wonka and together ahhhhh 
I literally cannot wait for this Like I used to watch the old Willy Wonka with Gene Wilder like every year and now we have a prequel that looks just as good if not better to me
I NEED MY GOLDEN TICKET
Wonka Godzilla x Kong The New Empire whats next on the Hype list
""
Epic What a classic
He just plays himself in every movie
Looks so good Timothy is such a skilled actorhe can play anything and makes it look effortless Cant wait
""
Another Oscar is ready to Timothee One of the greatest movies of the year maybe the only one in this year I cant wait  Amazing fascinating and breathtaking Well done
Crispin Glover should play Wonka He was great in Epic Movie
Hugh Grant threw me off at the end  
Anotha one
OH MY GODDDD
its giving Paddington vibes
Why
Im in Its different enough and his acting is so nuanced
It looks great
And perfect movie for Christmas 
Man I love his Gene Wilder energy
I love it People The variety our Timothe can present us with  
DUNEw
a bit disappointing i thought it was more about willy wonkas adventures in search of the ingredients
huh  anyway its going to be a flop 
oh this one is going down on history books
i really hope that the 5 winners make a appearance in this movie
Who up Wonkin they Willy rn
013015 Nice to see Warner Bros  Village Roadshow Pictures teaming up again
IM SO READY
MR BEANS BACK I honestly more excited to see him
Trailer 2 Please
Surprised they didnt make Willy a half black quarter indian quarter chinese transexual hermaphrodite with how the world is these days Maybe in the sequel
Hugh Grant as an Oompa loompa is GENIUS casting
Looks pretty good
A story of how Willy wonka became a the greatest chocolate maker of all the world
This looks surprisingly good The musical numbers look fun
I saw that the director from Paddington was directingIm sold
Looks really good tbh
HUGH GRANT IS AN OOMPA LOOMPA I NEEDED THIS IN MY LIFE
LONG LIVE THE OOMPAS
"
    
 
   
       
   UU     "
"I thought that this wasnt connected to either of the movies that came before but the character designs definitely make it seem like a prequel to the OG Gene Wilder movie

Those are big shoes to fill but I hope they can pull it off"
8 minuetIve never been this early
OH MY GOD HES SO FIT
Epic
Who else wonking up their willy
Cant wait
Hi
OH MY GOD HE IS SO PERFECT FOR THIS ROLE I AM SO EXCITED
Wow This looks interesting and beautiful 
First time seeing Timothe take on a fantasy and musical role Boy be expanding his acting profile Cant wait
Why that actor tho 
Wait this is prequel to original Chocolate Factory with Gene Wilder Dont get me wrong that movie is good but Charlie and Chocolate Factory with Johnny Depp is closer to book I thought it was going to be prequel to that movie
johnny cameo must be included
Wow
so is this like a prequel to the 2005 Johnny Depp film
a talking oompa loompa  thats nice 
Looks cute something for the kids to enjoy at Christmastime
Charming
He needs his Willy
I still think Michael Bay would have been a better fit for this
Looks amazing 
Hugh Fking Grant as the Umpaloopas
No me empolguei
Oh god If Roald Dahl was alive hed probably hate it
Wait this looks good
The cocoa must flow
Many people have come here to sell chocolate but theyve all been crushed by the government Sugar tax
Lets hope this movie gets the numbers it deserves
I cant wait to watch this It looks wonderful
Finally Jonka
This is the best birthday gift ever Thank you for this
LOL This looks bad   WB scraping the bottom of the barrel for ideas
Did anyone notice Rowan Atkinson
"He is no Johnny Depp that is for sure
But the black representation with the little girl and Willy wonk will hopefully repair the problem the book had"
Ngl this looks amazing and I need it And I want chocolate now
Surprisingly on time cant wait
Actually looks charming
Pleeeease let it be good I went to see the Charlie  the chocolate factory theatre production this year  it had been mutilated by wokery Dont let this be the same 
Breaking Bad  Chocolate Edition
This brings johnny kind of memoriesthis Will be epic
Is that Mr Mosby
Michael Key 
Why the weird accents mish mash  Looks good though
We makin it out of Oompa Loompa Land with this one
love that they brought back the og oompa loompas
I will watch the st out of this movie 
Who saw our legend
i want Timothe Chalamet to turn me into a blueberry
Im guessing this will be the origin of Genes version and not Depps
ive always wanted to know how he became wonka guess im gonna find out when it releases at cinema looks amazing
Not only did this answer my question this is a prequel to the gene wilder Willy Wonka but it will be bloody magnificent
This looks beautiful
Gee this is wonkus
ITS WONKA TIME
I thought it would be more like Deps version darker This is the kids version 
It gonna be kinda funny to watch Warner Bros compete with themselves this Christmas with this Aquaman 2 and The Color Purple
Hugh Grant as a Oompa Loompa Im Sold
Oompa Loompa Doompa Dee Doo Ive got another prequel for you
TIMMY I WILL BE YOUR OOMPA LOOMPA
141 IS he rowan Atkinson 
I think Warner Bros is healing
looks like a supervillain origin
Looks so adorable but i dont know
TIMOTHEE HAS DONE IT AGAIN 
The director of Paddington  I am absolutely INVESTED
Timothee dances Take my money 
Glad its not a reboot really
TIMOTHEE IS A MASTERPIECE
I have a feeling that this film might get nominated at the different movie awards since this had potential on being surprisingly good
tehe me and baba hashtag hyped
ill catch it on streaming and then probably skip thru it
Wheres the part about when Wonka realizes how much fun he would have killing misbehaved children
Paul king is back after Paddington 2 Excited for this one
That no daydreaming rule made me chuckle for some reason
We at some point we would get a Willy wonka solo movie AND WE ARE Looks dope ngl
This actually looks really good 
Typical Hollywoodinstead of hiring a dwarf to play a Oompa Loompathey had to digitally cgi a normal size man to play one
Im so hyped I love Willy
A 2 minute trailer already gave Willy Wonka a better origin than Charlie and the Chocolate Factory did
You had me at from the director of Paddington Also never in a million years would I have thought Hugh Grant as an Oompa Loompa was something that I needed in my life but here we are
This looks soboring
I dont know if you can hate on this one after watching the trailer It looks great
timmy is eatin this year
This seems like a completely different movie but its surprisingly still set within the Willy wonks world
I Cant wait to see the prequel film before Charlie Bucket in the early 1970s classic movie ever to be created
2005 Wonka Johnny Depp Too much chemistry 
uh hes not very good lol
Huhneat
Kinda dont like his Wonka acting comes out a bit unnatural in a wrong way will need to wait till the movie comes Love timothee just need to see more Cinematography looks amazing tho 
MR BEANNN
Hugh Grant is going to be the best umpa lumpa Ive ever seen
Chocolaaaaaaate
We will be watching
This might become my favourite Timothee Character
Paul Atreides from worm rider and prophesied Messiah to candy factory owner
Mr Bean in this film Lets go its about to Epic
MR BEAANNNNN 
Magical 
Try some more 
 I love it
I love the original movie and I know I going to love this prequel
OMG I love Timothee as Wonka so looking forward to seeing this movie

This cast is so incredible 
Cool
Timothe seems very charismatic This doesnt look too bad Im not a huge Wonka fan But Ill watch because I like a good musical

Time to take a trip through a World of Pure Imagination
So excited for this
Chalamet is tooo Good
who up wonking they willy rn
No way they made a movie about the Mr Beasts video  
IM SO EXCITED
Wonkas origins
Excited
Missing Oompa Loompas 
Timothee is PERFECT for this role
Wow
I have mixed feelings about this
Horrible CGI just look at 025 or at the oompa loompas seriously horribly made cgi
Looks really good
That looked great
His acting is so bad and unbelievable wtf
Wonka is  on russian  its a as This words look simply for russian community
excited to see this
Im gonna watch this just for Rowan Atkinson
My eyes rolled so hard they fell right out of my head
Omg
Hope this movie helps restore the old charm of Hollywood movies
However small the chance might be of striking lucky the chance was there
Please let this be good 
Omg 
Of course theres a black person

Timothy really has been killing it these past few years

In addition Im still waiting for that Coyote vs Acme trailer"
